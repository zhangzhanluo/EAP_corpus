The three-dimensional structure of swirl-switching in bent pipe fow 

Swirl-switching is a low-frequency oscillatory phenomenon which a ects the Dean vor-tices in bent pipes and may cause fatigue in piping systems. Despite thirty years worth of research, the mechanism that causes these oscillations and the frequencies that characterise them remain unclear. Here we show that a three-dimensional wave-like structure is responsible for the low-frequency switching of the dominant Dean vortex. The present study, performed via direct numerical simulation, focuses on the turbulent fow through a 90. pipe bend preceded and followed by straight pipe segments. A pipe with curvature 0.3 (defned as ratio between pipe radius and bend radius) is studied for a bulk Reynolds number Re = 11 700, corresponding to a friction Reynolds number Re. ¡Ö 360. Synthetic turbulence is generated at the infow section and used instead of the classical recycling method in order to avoid the interference between recycling and swirl-switching frequencies. The fow feld is analysed by three-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) which for the frst time allows the identifcation of the source of swirl-switching: a wave-like structure that originates in the pipe bend. Contrary to some previous studies, the fow in the upstream pipe does not show any direct infuence on the swirl-switching modes. Our analysis further shows that a three-dimensional characterisation of the modes is crucial to understand the mechanism, and that reconstructions based on 2D POD modes are incomplete.

1. Introduction 
Bent pipes are an essential component of a large number of industrial machines and processes. They are ideal for increasing mass and momentum transfer, passively mixing di erent fuids, which makes them e ective as heat exchangers, inverters, and other appliances. For a review of the applications of bent pipes in industry see Vashisth et al. (2008); the most recent advances in experiments and simulations can be found in the review by Kalpakli Vester et al. (2016). The high mass and momentum transfer is generated by the secondary motion caused by the centrifugal force acting on the fuid in the curved sections. This secondary motion, which is of Prandtl¡¯s frst kind, takes the shape of two counter-rotating vortices, illustrated in fgure 1, which move the fuid

towards the outside of the bend, along the centreline, and back towards the inside along the wall, therefore increasing the mass and momentum transfer across the pipe section. 
These vortices were frst observed by Boussinesq (1868) and Eustice (1910), and later described analytically by Dean (1928) from whom they received the name of Dean vortices. The intensity of these vortices increases with Reynolds number, here based on pipe diameter and bulk velocity (i.e., Re = DUb/¦Í, where ¦Í is the kinematic viscosity of the fuid), as well as with pipe curvature, defned as the ratio between pipe radius and bend radius, ¦Ä = R/Rc (see Canton et al. 2017 for laminar fow; Noorani et al. 2013, the review by Kalpakli Vester et al. 2016, and references therein, for turbulent fows). 
For laminar, steady fow the Dean vortices are symmetric with respect to the bend symmetry plane (the I-O plane in fgure 1); but when the fow becomes unstable the vortices start oscillating periodically (K¡§uhnen et al. 2014, 2015; Canton et al. 2016). These large-scale oscillations are caused by the appearance of periodic travelling waves which, as also observed in other fows (see, e.g. Hof et al. 2004), are at the base of transition to turbulence for toroidal and helical pipes. 
A di erent kind of large-scale oscillations is observed for high Reynolds numbers: here the turbulent fow is modulated by a low-frequency alternation of the dominant Dean vortex. This vortex alternation excites the pipe structure and is presumed to be the cause of structural, low-frequency oscillations observed in heat exchangers (e.g. in microgravity conditions such as in a test for the international space station; Br¡§ucker 1998), as well as the origin of secondary motion in the bends of the cooling system of nuclear reactors (Kalpakli Vester et al. 2016). The Dean vortex alternation was initially, and unexpectedly, observed by Tunstall & Harvey (1968), who experimentally studied the turbulent fow through a sharp, L-shaped bend (¦Ä = 1). These authors measured ¡°low random-frequency¡± switches between two distinct states and, by means of fow visualisations, were able to identify an either clockwise or anti-clockwise predominance of the swirling fow following the bent section. The switching was found to have a Strouhal number St = f D/Ub highly dependent on Re and comprised between 2 ¡Á 10.4 and 
4.5 ¡Á 10.3 . Tunstall & Harvey attributed the origin of the switching to the presence of a separation bubble in the bend and to the ¡°occasional existence of turbulent circulation entering the bend¡±. 
To the best of our knowledge, the frst author to continue the work by Tunstall & Harvey (1968) was Br¡§ucker (1998), who analysed the phenomenon via particle image velocimetry (PIV) and coined the term ¡°swirl-switching¡±. Br¡§ucker studied a smoothly curved pipe with ¦Ä =0.5 and identifed the oscillations as a continuous transition between two mirror-symmetric states with one Dean cell larger than the other. He confrmed that the switching takes place only when the fow is turbulent, and he reported two distinct peaks, St =0.03 and 0.12, at frequencies considerably higher than those measured by Tunstall and Harvey, despite the lower Reynolds numbers considered. 
R¡§utten et al. (2001, 2005) were the frst to numerically study swirl-switching by performing large-eddy simulations (LES) for ¦Ä =0.167 and 0.5. The main result of this analysis is that the switching takes place even without fow separation; moreover, R¡§utten and co-workers found that the structure of the switching is more complex than just the alternation between two distinct symmetric states, since the outer stagnation point ¡°can be found at any angular position within ¡À40.¡±. R¡§utten et al. found a high-frequency peak at St ¡Ö 0.2, attributed to a shear-layer instability, and, only for their high Reynolds number case, one low-frequency peak for St ¡Ö 5.5¡Á 10.3 , which was connected to the swirl-switching. However, the simulations for R¡§utten et al.¡¯s work were performed by using a ¡°recycling¡± method, where the results from a straight pipe simulation were used as infow condition for the bent pipe. These periodic straight pipes were of length

L =3.5D and 5D and likely infuenced the frequencies measured in the bent pipes since the periodicity of the straight pipes introduced a forcing for St = Ub/L =1/3.5 and 1/5, respectively. 
Sakakibara et al. (2010) were the frst to analyse the fow by means of two-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (2D POD) performed on snapshots extracted from stereo PIV. Their results for ¦Ä =0.75 reveal anti-symmetric structures that span the entire pipe cross-section and contain most of the energy of the fow. A spectral analysis of the corresponding time coe.cients shows peaks between St ¡Ö 0.07 at so =2D and St ¡Ö 0.02 for so = 25D, in the range found by Br¡§ucker (1998). In a subsequent work Sakakibara & Machida (2012) conjectured that the swirl-switching is caused by very large-scale motions (VLSM) formed in the straight pipe preceding the bend. 
¡§ 
Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013) and Kalpakli & Orl¡§u (2013) also presented results based on 2D POD. The former performed experiments for ¦Ä =0.5 and found non-symmetric modes resembling a tilted variant of the Dean vortices with St =0.16 and 0.33, corresponding 
¡§ 
to the shear-layer instabilities found by R¡§utten et al. (2005). Kalpakli & Orl¡§u (2013), on the other hand, studied a pipe with ¦Ä =0.31; di erently from previous works, the section of straight pipe following the bend was only 0.67 diameters long. Their results at the exit of this short segment show clearly antisymmetric modes as most dominant structures. The swirl-switching frequency obtained from the POD time coe.cients was St =0.04; peaks of St =0.12 and 0.18 were also measured but were found not to be related to swirl-switching. In a later work Kalpakli Vester et al. (2015) repeated the experiments for ¦Ä =0.39 and found again a dominant frequency corresponding to St =0.04. 
¡§ 
Carlsson et al. (2015) performed LES in a geometry similar to that of Kalpakli & Orl¡§u (2013), namely, with a short straight section following the bend, for four di erent curvatures. The infow boundary condition was generated by means of a recycling method,

as in R¡§utten et al. (2001, 2005), with a straight pipe of length 7D, exciting the fow in the bent pipe at St =1/7. The three lower curvatures were therefore dominated by the spurious frequencies artifcially created in the straight pipe by the recycling method, while the frequencies measured for ¦Ä = 1, corresponding to 0.5 < St < 0.6, were in the same range identifed by Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013) but were found to be mesh dependent. 
Noorani & Schlatter (2016) were the frst to investigate the swirl-switching by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS). By using a toroidal pipe they showed that swirl-switching is not caused by structures coming from the straight pipe preceding the bend, but is a phenomenon inherent to the curved section. Two curvatures were investigated, ¦Ä =0.1 and 0.3, and both presented a pair of antisymmetric Dean vortices as the most energetic POD mode with St =0.01 and 0.087. 
Table 1 summarises the main results of the aforementioned studies. It is clear from this literature review that there is a strong disagreement among previous works not only on what is the mechanism that leads to swirl-switching, but also on what is the frequency that characterises this phenomenon. In the present work an answer to both questions will be given, which will also explain the discrepancies between previous studies. 
The paper continues with a description of the numerical methods employed for the analysis, presented in ¡ì2, devoting special attention to the infow boundary conditions. The results of the simulations and POD analysis are presented in ¡ì3 and are discussed and compared with the literature in ¡ì4. 
2. Analysis methods 
2.1. Numerical discretisation The present analysis is performed via DNS of the incompressible Navier¨CStokes equations. The equations are discretised with the spectral-element code Nek5000 (Fischer et al. 2008) using a PN . PN.2 formulation. After an initial mesh-dependency study, the polynomial order was set to N = 8 for the velocity and, consequently, N =6 for the pressure. We consider a 90. bent pipe with curvature ¦Ä =0.3 for a Reynolds number Re = 11 700, corresponding to a friction Reynolds number Re. ¡Ö 360 (referred to the straight pipe sections). A straight pipe of length Li =7D precedes the bent section (see ¡ì3.1), and a second straight segment of length Lo = 15D follows it. Further 
details about the mesh, including element number and size, are reported in table 2. The supplementary video movie1.m4v shows the setup and a visualization of the fow.

Quantities indicated as (¡¤)+ are reported in viscous scaling, and the numbers between parenthesis correspond to minimum and maximum values. 
2.2. Infow boundary and divergence-free synthetic eddy method Since the aim of the present work is to reproduce and study swirl-switching, a periodic or quasi-periodic phenomenon, the treatment of the infow boundary is of utmost impor-tance. The fow feld prescribed at the infow boundary should not introduce any artifcial frequency, in order to avoid the excitation of unphysical phenomena or a modifcation of the frequencies inherent to the swirl-switching. A recycling method, as the one used by R¡§utten et al. (2001, 2005) and Carlsson et al. (2015), should therefore be avoided, as highlighted in ¡ì1. In the present work the velocity feld at the inlet boundary of the straight pipe preceding the bend is prescribed via a divergence-free synthetic eddy method (DFSEM). This method, introduced by Poletto et al. (2011) and based on the original work by Jarrin et al. (2006), works by prescribing a mean fow modulated in time by fuctuations in the vorticity feld. The superposition of the two reproduces up to second order the mean turbulent fuctuations of a reference fow and requires a short streamwise adjustment length to fully reproduce all quantities. The fuctuations are provided by a large number of randomly distributed ¡°vorticity spheres¡± (or ¡°eddies¡±) which are generated and advected with the bulk velocity in a fctitious cylindrical container located around the infow section. When a sphere exits the container, a new, randomly located sphere is created to substitute it. The cylindrical container is dimensioned such that newly created eddies do not touch the inlet plane upon their creation and they have stopped a ecting it before exiting the container, i.e., the cylinder extends from . max(Deddies) to max(Deddies) (see fgure 5 in Poletto et al. 2013, for an illustration of the container). The random numbers required to create the fuctuations are generated on a single pro-cessor with a pseudo random number generator (Chandler & Northrop 2003) featuring an algorithmic period of 21376 iterations, large enough to exclude any periodicity in the simulations, which feature approximately 10 000 synthetic eddies. The size of the spheres is selected to match the local integral turbulence length scale, and their intensity is scaled to recover the reference turbulent kinetic energy, producing isotropic but heterogeneous second-order moments. The method prescribes isotropic turbulence, instead of the correct anisotropic variant, because it was shown that the former leads to a shorter adjustment length in wall-bounded fows (see fgure 11 in Jarrin et al. 2006). In order to satisfy the continuity equation, no synthetic turbulence is created below (R . r)+ < 10; however, this does not signifcantly a ect the adjustment length since the dynamics of the viscous sublayer are faster than the mean and converge to a fully developed state in a shorter distance. The turbulence statistics necessary for the method, specifcally the mean fow U (r), the turbulent kinetic energy k(r), and the dissipation rate .(r), were extracted from the straight pipe DNS performed by El Khoury et al. (2013). Section 3.1 presents the 
validation of our implementation of the DFSEM; more details can be found in Hufnagel (2016). 
2.3. Proper orthogonal decomposition 
Besides point measures, we use POD (Lumley 1967) to extract coherent structures from the DNS fow felds and identify the mechanism responsible for swirl-switching. More specifcally, we use snapshot POD (Sirovich 1987) where n three-dimensional, full-domain fow felds of dimension d (corresponding to the number of velocity unknowns) are stored as snapshots. POD decomposes the fow in a set of orthogonal spatial modes i(x) and corresponding time coe.cients ai(t) ranked by kinetic energy content, in decreasing order. The most energetic structure extracted by POD corresponds to the mean fow and will be herein named ¡°zeroth mode¡±, while the term ¡°frst mode¡± will be reserved for the frst time-dependent structure. 
A series of instantaneous fow felds (snapshots) is ordered column-wise in a matrix S ¡Ê Rd¡Án and decomposed as: 
d 
X 
S = UV . = iai, (2.1) i=1 
where U ¡Ê Rd¡Ád ,  = diag(¦Ò1,¦Ò2, ¡¤¡¤¡¤ ,¦Òm, 0), with m = min(d, n), and V ¡Ê Rn¡Án . The decomposition in (2.1) is obtained by computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of M1/2ST 1/2 , where M is the mass matrix and T is the temporal weights matrix, which 
. .. 
results in . VU and . are unitary matrices ( . U. V .= I); the U . , where . VU = I and . V 
M.1/2 . .1/2 .
POD modes are then obtained as U = U and V = TV . To improve the convergence of the decomposition, we exploit the symmetry of the pipe about the I . O plane, which results into a statistical symmetry for the fow, and store an additional mirror image for each snapshot (Berkooz et al. 1993). 
3. Results and analysis 
3.1. Infow validation An auxiliary simulation for Re. = 360 was set up to test the performance of the DFSEM in a 25D long straight pipe, provided with the same mesh characteristics used for the bent pipes. Classical statistical quantities were used for the validation and compared with the reference values by El Khoury et al. (2013). The comparison is presented in fgure 2(a) as a function of distance from the infow boundary, and shows that the DFSEM approaches a fully developed turbulent state (within ¡À1% of error) at approximately 5D from the infow boundary. Figures 2(b-d) present the velocity, stress profles, and the turbulent kinetic energy budget at the chosen streamwise position of si =5D, which confrm the recovery of fully developed turbulence by the divergence-free synthetic eddy method. A length of 7D was therefore chosen for the straight pipe preceding the bent section, in order to allow for some tolerance and to account for the (weak, up to 1D) upstream infuence of the Dean vortices (Anwer et al. 1989; Sudo et al. 1998). For comparison, the more commonly used approach where random noise is prescribed at the infow requires a development length between 50 and 110D (Doherty et al. 2007). POD modes were also computed to further check the correctness of this method. The results, not reported here for conciseness, were in good agreement with those presented by Carlsson et al. 
(2015) for a periodic straight pipe, that is, streamwise invariant modes with azimuthal wavenumbers between 3 and 7.

Solid lines indicate the reference data, while symbols represent the current results (note that the number of shown points is reduced and does therefore not represent the grid resolution; see table 2). 
3.2. Two-dimensional POD 
Two-dimensional POD, considering all three velocity components, is employed as a frst step in the analysis of swirl-switching. Instantaneous velocity felds are saved at a distance of 2D from the end of the bent section and are used, with their mirror images, to assemble the snapshot matrices (Berkooz et al. 1993). 1 234 velocity felds were saved at a sampling frequency of St =0.25, and the sampling was started only after the solution had reached a statistically steady state. As a consequence of exploiting the mirror symmetry, all modes are either symmetric or antisymmetric, a condition to which they would converge provided that a su.cient number of snapshots had been saved. 
The frst three modes are shown in fgure 3 by means of pseudocolors of their streamwise velocity component and streamlines of the in-plane velocity components. Two out of three modes are antisymmetric: (i, ii) and are in the form of a single swirl covering the whole

pipe section, (i), and a double swirl, (ii), formed by two counter-rotating vortices disposed along the inner-outer direction on the symmetry plane. The third mode, (iii), resembles a harmonic of the Dean vortices. 
These fndings are in agreement with previous experimental work, such as that of ¡§ 
Sakakibara et al. (2010) and Kalpakli & Orl¡§u (2013), which attributed the dynamics of swirl-switching to the antisymmetric modes. The frequency content of these modes is presented in fgure 4, in terms of Welch¡¯s power spectral density estimate for the time coe.cients of the frst three modes, corresponding to the structures shown in fgure 3. It can be observed that the spectra have a low peak-to-noise ratio and that each mode is characterised by a di erent spectrum and peak frequency, in agreement with previous 2D POD studies: see, e.g., fgure 8 in Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013), which presents peaks with similar values to the present ones, although their study was for a slightly larger curvature of ¦Ä =0.5. This fact has caused some confusion in the past, with disagreeing authors attributing di erent causes to the various peaks, without being able to come to the same conclusion about the frequency, nor the structure, of swirl-switching. The reason is that swirl-switching is caused by a three-dimensional wave-like structure, as will be shown by 3D POD in ¡ì3.3, and a two-dimensional cross-fow analysis cannot distinguish between the spatial and temporal amplitude modulations created by the passage of the wave. A simple analytical demonstration of this concept is provided in the Appendix, and shows that conclusions drawn from a fow reconstruction based on 2D POD modes (see, e.g., Hellstr¡§om et al. 2013) are incomplete. 

3.3. Three-dimensional POD For the 3D POD, the same snapshots as for 2D POD were used. In order to reduce memory requirements, the snapshots were interpolated on a coarser mesh before com-puting the POD. This is, however, not a problem because the swirl-switching is related to large-scale fuctuations in the fow. The four most energetic modes are depicted in fgure 5 by means of pseudocolors of nor-mal and streamwise velocity components, as well as streamlines of the in-plane velocity. It can be observed that the modes come in pairs: 1-2 and 3-4, as is usual for POD modes and their time coe.cients in a convective fow. The frst coherent structure extracted by the POD is formed by modes 1 and 2 and constitutes a damped wave-like structure that is convected by the mean fow (see fgure 5 for the spatial structure and fgure 6 for the corresponding time coe.cients; the supplementary video movie2 modes0-2.mov shows their behaviour in time). This is not a travelling wave such as those observed in transitional fows, as the ones of the examples mentioned in the introduction, but a coherent structure extracted by POD from a developed turbulent background that persists in fully developed turbulence, and is just a regular component of the fow on which irregular turbulent fuctuations are superimposed (see, e.g., Manhart & Wengle 1993, for a similar case). Nevertheless, the present wave-like structure could be a surviving remnant of pre-existing, purely time-periodic, fow structures formed in the bent section and arising in the process of transition to turbulence past bends (see, e.g., the case of the fow past a circular cylinder by Sipp & Lebedev 2007). It was found that the frst instability of the fow inside of a toroidal pipe is characterised by the appearance of travelling waves (K¡§uhnen et al. 2014; Canton et al. 2016). It is therefore possible that similar waves appear in the transition to turbulence of the present fow case, and continue to modulate the large scales of the fow at high Reynolds numbers while being submerged in small-scale turbulence. To support this hypothesis, the frequencies and wavelengths of the present coherent structures are in the same range as those measured in toroidal pipes (Canton et al. 2016), and Br¡§ucker (1998) observed swirl-switching even for Re as low as 2 000, although the measured oscillations had very low amplitude. The present modes are, obviously, not strictly periodic in space nor in time: as can be seen in fgure 5(b) showing the swirl intensity, the intensity of the modes is essentially zero upstream of the bend (s< 0), reaches a maximum at about 1D downstream of the bend end, and then decreases with the distance from the bend. Furthermore, the respective time coe.cients are only quasiperiodic, as can be observed from their temporal signal, depicted in fgure 6(a), and by their frequency spectra, fgure 7(a). Nevertheless, it can be observed in fgure 5 that the spatial structure of these modes is qualitatively sinusoidal along the streamwise direction so, with a wavelength of about 7 pipe diameters. The fgures in Br¡§ucker (1998) actually already suggest the appearance of a wave-like structure in the presence of swirl-switching. This wave-like structure is formed by two counter-rotating swirls, visible in the 2D cross-sections in fgure 5, which are advected in the streamwise direction while decaying in intensity and, at the same time, move from the inside of the bend towards the outside, as can be seen in the longitudinal cuts in fgure 5 and in the supplementary video movie2 modes0-2.mov. The temporal amplitude of these modes is also qualitatively cyclic, as illustrated by the projection along the time coe.cients in fgure 6(b). The 
wave-like behaviour can be appreciated even better in the aforementioned video showing the fow reconstructed with these two modes, movie2 modes0-2.mov. Modes 1 and 2 are

The second structure, formed by modes 3 and 4, has a spatial layout that closely resembles that of the frst pair, i.e., it is also a wave-like structure, and constitutes the frst ¡°harmonic¡± of the wave formed by modes 1 and 2. The spatial structure of modes 3 and 4 has half of the main wavelength of modes 1 and 2, and the highest peak in the spectrum of the third and fourth time coe.cients is at exactly twice the frequency of the peaks of a1 and a2, as can be seen in fgure 7(a). The video movie3 
modes0-4.mov shows the reconstruction of the fow feld by including modes 3 and 4. It can be observed that these modes introduce oscillations with higher frequency and smaller amplitude when compared to the reconstruction employing only modes 1 and 2. 
As can be observed from fgure 5, the modes do not present any connection to the straight pipe section preceding the bend. This is in direct contrast with the fndings of Carlsson et al. (2015), whose results were likely altered by the interference of an intrinsic frequency and wavelength on the recycling infow boundary with the structure of the swirl-switching. Our results are, instead, in agreement with Noorani & Schlatter (2016) who observed swirl-switching in a toroidal pipe (i.e., in the absence of a straight upstream section) confrming that these large-scale oscillations are not caused by structures formed in the straight pipe, but by an e ect which is intrinsic to the bent section. 
The power spectral density analysis of the time coe.cients of these modes, computed as a Welch¡¯s estimate, is presented in fgure 7. One can see that, unlike the PSD of the two-dimensional POD modes (fgure 4), the three-dimensional modes present two distinct peaks, one per pair of modes. The peak for the frst modal pair is located at St ¡Ö 0.16, which is in the range of Strouhal numbers found by both Br¡§ucker (1998) and Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013). More importantly, this frequency is the lowest for this pair of modes and matches that given by the wavelength and propagation speed of the wave as well as that of the swirl-switching, as observed by reconstructing the fow feld with the most energetic POD modes (see the online movies). 
The present analyses were also performed on a pipe with curvature ¦Ä =0.1 for the same Reynolds number. Swirl-switching was observed in this case as well, with dynamics which is qualitatively identical to the one observed for ¦Ä =0.3, but is characterised by lower frequencies, peaking at St ¡Ö 0.045. The lower frequencies and larger scales (wavelength of about 20D) characterising the wave-like structure at this curvature meant that a quantitative analysis was too expensive with the present setup. We have therefore limited this work to the study of one curvature only, but preliminary, not converged results can be found in Hufnagel (2016). 
4. Summary and conclusions 
This work presents the frst DNS analysis of swirl-switching in a 90. bent pipe. The simulations were performed by using a synthetic eddy method to generate high-quality infow conditions, in an e ort to avoid any interference between the incoming fow and the dynamics of the fow in the bent section, as was observed in previous studies. Three-dimensional POD was used to isolate the dominant structures of the fow. This method allowed the identifcation of a wave-like structure, originating in the bent section, constituted by the frst modal pair. A reconstruction of the fow feld using the most energetic modal pair confrmed that the swirl-switching is caused by this structure. 
The swirl-switching frequency found in the present study is in the range of those deduced by Br¡§ucker (1998) and Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013). The structure of the modes, which presents no connection to the upstream straight pipe, confrms what was conjectured by Noorani & Schlatter (2016), who observed swirl-switching in a toroidal pipe, namely that swirl-switching is a phenomenon intrinsic to the bent pipe section. 
Clearly, the present fndings are in contrast with previous conclusions drawn from fow reconstructions based on 2D POD modes and Taylor¡¯s frozen turbulence hypothesis (see, e.g., Hellstr¡§om et al. 2013): the 2D analysis mixes convection and true temporal variation, and thus cannot reveal the full three-dimensional structure of travelling modes. This does not only apply to the present fow case, but to any streamwise inhomogeneous fow in which 2D POD is utilised in the cross-fow direction. 
The wave-like structure found in the present study is di erent from those observed in transitional fows (see, e.g. Hof et al. 2004), in the sense that it is simply a coherent structure extracted by POD from a turbulent background fow, as opposed to an exact coherent state. Nevertheless, we conjecture that this structure may be a surviving remnant of a global instability caused by the bend (K¡§uhnen et al. 2014; Canton et al. 2016).

Appendix. Considerations on the use of 2D POD 
This section explains, analytically, the reasons why a two-dimensional cross-fow POD analysis is an ine ective tool for understanding swirl-switching. In order to capture the essence of the phenomenon, the example is without spatial dissipation and noise, but these can be added at will without changing the discussion or the results. A Matlab script performing the operations described in this section is provided as part of the supplementary online material. 
Consider a sine wave of period 2¦Ðl, travelling at speed v, and with amplitude modulated at a frequency ¦Ø/(2¦Ð): 
 
x . vt 
g(x, t)=sin cos(¦Øt) . (A 1) 
l When measuring its passage at a given spatial position, say g(xm,t), the recorded time signal will contain two frequencies, f1 =(¦Ø . v/l)/(2¦Ð) and f2 =(¦Ø + v/l)/(2¦Ð), that combine the spatial component, fs = v/(2¦Ðl), and the temporal component, ft = ¦Ø/(2¦Ð). This combination is a result of the fact that g can be rewritten, using one prosthaphaeresis formula, separating the time and space dependencies: 
hi hi
1 xv 1 xv 
g(x, t)=sin + ¦Ø . t + sin . ¦Ø + t. (A 2) 
2 ll 2 ll The two components, fs and ft, would be measured in isolation if the function g were a pure travelling wave (¦Ø = 0) or a pure standing wave (v = 0). However, when both aspects are present (¦Ø =6 0 and v =6 0) a complete knowledge of g is necessary in order to separate fs from ft. This, clearly, is possible in the present example, where the analytical expression of g(x, t) is known. When studying an unknown phenomenon (such as swirl-switching) the knowledge of f1 and f2 is insu.cient: one does not know what is causing the measured frequencies: it could be two travelling waves advected at di erent speeds (or provided with di erent period); two standing waves modulated at di erent frequencies; or, as in this case, one travelling wave with modulated amplitude. This problem can transferred to a POD analysis as well: the 2D POD in the pipe corresponds to a zero-dimensional POD in this example, which employs the measurements g(xm,ti) as snapshots, while the 3D POD of the bent pipe fow corresponds to a one-dimensional POD which uses the function g(x, ti) over the whole x domain as snapshots. The 0D POD returns a single mode which assumes a value of either +1 or .1 and does not provide any information about the spatial structure of g. The spectrum of the time coe.cient corresponding to this single mode contains both frequencies f1 and f2. When using 0D POD one does not have any information about the spatial nature of g, and is lead to believe that the oscillations measured in xm are caused by two periodic phenomena with frequencies f1 and f2. This likely is what has caused so much disagreement in the literature about the value of the Strouhal number related to the swirl-switching and on the 2D POD mode responsible for this phenomenon. The answer is that none of the 2D POD modes reported in the literature is actually the swirl-switching mode, and the Strouhal numbers extracted from time coe.cients do not provide a correct description. A 1D POD analysis of the function g, which is the analogue of the 3D POD in the 
bent pipe, provides the correct answers. It results in two sinusoidal modes which, with the corresponding time coe.cients, reproduce the complete travelling and oscillatory behaviour of g. The spectra of the time coe.cients still contain only f1 and f2, but have a much higher peak to noise ratio compared to the 0D POD, as observed in the bent pipe by comparing fgures 4 and 7. Moreover, by analysing the reconstruction of g, they allow the separation of fs from ft. 
It is now clear why in the case of a streamwise-dependent spatial structure, such as the one creating swirl-switching (as shown in ¡ì3.3), only a fully three-dimensional analysis can correctly identify the actual spatial and temporal components.
