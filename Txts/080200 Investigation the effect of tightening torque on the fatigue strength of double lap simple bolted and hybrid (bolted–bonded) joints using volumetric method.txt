                            In this research, the effect of the tightening torque on the fatigue strength of 2024-T3 double lap simple
                              bolted and hybrid (bolted–bonded) joints have been investigated experimentally by conducting fatigue
                        tests and numerically by implementing ﬁnite element analysis. To do so, three sets of specimens were
                                                        prepared and each of them subjected to tightening torque of 1, 2.5 and 5 Nm and then fatigue tests were
                                                         carried out under different cyclic longitudinal load levels. In the numerical method, the effect of the tight-

                                      available smooth S–N curve of Al2024-T3 and the fatigue notch factors obtained from the volumetric
                                        method were used. The estimated fatigue life was compared with the available experimental test results.
                                                         The investigation shows that there is a good agreement between the life predicted by the volumetric

accordance with the adhesive manufacturer suggestion.
