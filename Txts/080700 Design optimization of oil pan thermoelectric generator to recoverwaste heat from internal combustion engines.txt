electric simulations is given in the supplementary section of this
study. After validating the numerical model on the single TE
module, we extended the simulation for multiple modules based
on the geometry of an oil pan as described in the next section.
Bismuth telluride (Bi Te ) was selected as the TE material in the
2 3
simulations. The material properties (i.e. Seebeck coefﬁcient, elec-
trical conductivity and, thermal conductivity) were input as
boundary conditions and estimated at the average temperature of
hot and cold surfaces as shown inTable 1.
Poweroutputwascalculatedfrom(Eq.(6))fordifferentexternal
(load) resistance values and an electric current which was deter-
mined at temperature gradient for hot and cold surfaces. The
maximum power was achieved when the external resistance
became identical to the internal resistance of the thermoelectric
system between metal and a p-n type element.
2.2. Optimization of TE module dimensions

3.3. Energy harvesting in larger sized oil pans
Oil pans of large duty heavy engines are also considered to
determine the effect of oil pan size onTE power generation in this
study. Increase of the surface area results in generating more
output power due to the larger number of TE modules that can be
ﬁttedintotheoil pan.Thesurfaceareaof theoilpanforlargeduty

the Inline (straight)-6 diesel Cummins ISX engine which was cho-

nozzle setup where air can be forced through the nozzle channel
toward the bottom surface of the oil pan which increases the air

Increased air velocity results in reduction in the bottomwall tem-

power.
