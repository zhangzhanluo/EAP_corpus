Combustion characteristics of solid waste biomass, oil shale, and coal 
ABSTRACT 
In this study, a developed two-dimensional mathematical model was used to represent the physical model of the combustion process of olive cake and date seed, and solve the governing equations using finite-volume method. The simulation was performed using ANSYS/Fluent software in order to estimate maximum temperature, heating values and pollutants concentrations. The obtained results were compared with experimental results, and corresponding values of oil shale and coal. The experimental work of direct burning of olive cake and date seeds was performed using an existing circulated fluidized bed (CFB) unit. 
It was found that the adiabatic flame temperatures were 1380 K and 839 K for olive cake and date seed, and 2260 K and 1080 K for coal and oil shale, respectively. The experimental results showed that the maximum tempera-tures were 1126 K and 723 K for olive cake and date seed, respectively. The lower heating values were 19,500 kJ/kg and 16,400 kJ/kg for olive cake and date seed, and 29,000 kJ/kg and 7000 kJ/kg for coal and oil shale, respectively. Thus, biomass such as date seed and olive cake may be used as an alter-native fuel in electrical power plants in olive-or date-producing countries, which may save 40% of fuel cost. 
Introduction 
Power generation from biomass has increased its share of total power generation in several countries. Despite the fact that prices of fossil fuels have dropped in recent years, benefits of biomass power generation such as carbon neutrality and energy security have prevented governments of many countries from abandoning the policy of increasing dependence on renewable energy and biomass. Biomass may be used to meet a wide variety of energy needs, including electricity generation, process heat for industry, and households heating. Partial replacing of conventional fossil fuels with biomass for energy production will result in a net reduction of greenhouse gases emissions and reduce the landfill (Gavaskar et al. 2012). The most common types of biomass energy applications reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 55¨C98% as compared to fossil fuels, even when transported long distances, as long as the biomass production does not cause any land-use change. Biomass may be used in a number of ways such as direct burning, gasification, fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and pyrolysis (Caputo et al. 2005; Gavaskar et al. 2012). Direct burning is the oldest and most common way of converting biomass energy into heat, mechanical power, or electricity. Circulated fluidized bed (FB) technique is one of the most competitive direct burning technologies for the utilization of biomass that enhance the efficiency of the combustion process while reducing the emission of harm gases (Caputo et al. 2005; Goswami 1986; Kunii and Levenspiel 1991). Biomass undergoes ignition, devolatilization, and solid char particles combustion stages during its combustion. Ignition is the process of initiating the combustion phenomenon, which is very important due to its influence on flame stability and extinction, pollutant formation, and emission. Devolatilization process involves the emission of the volatile gaseous matters, which are ignited and undergoes a homogenous combustion after heated up to a certain temperature. Solid char particles combustion, which is ignited as a result of volatile combustion, followed by a heterogeneous reaction, involves the direct attack of oxygen on the solid particles (Kunii and Levenspiel 1991). 
Olive cake, which is a waste of olive oil-mill, is an important biomass generated in Mediterranean countries where it is available in large amounts and low cost. Olive cake is considered as an alternative fuel source with very low sulfur contents, <0.1 wt%, which makes it an environmental-friendly fuel. Moreover, olive cake is a waste that needs a suitable and acceptable disposal, or it may cause environmental problems, which makes the utilization of olive waste in energy production not only a clean energy source but also an acceptable disposal of this waste. Jordan is one of the rich countries with olives and dates. Olive tree farming in Jordan started 1600 years ago. In the past few decades, the country witnessed a dramatic expansion in the olive tree agriculture. It is estimated that 15 million olive trees exist in Jordan. These trees produce around 230,000 tons of olives per year. The production process of olive oil involves the pressing of olives to produce 37,000 ton of olive oil and about 80,000 tons of solid waste, named olive cake (Ministry of Agriculture of Jordan, 2015). Topal, Atimtay, and Durmaz (2003) studied the combustion characteristics of olive cake produced in Turkey using a circulating FB. The concentrations of O2,SO2,CO2, CO, NOx, and total hydrocarbons were measured in the flue gas. It was found that the combustion efficiency for olive cake changes between 82.25% and 98.66% for various excess air ratios used in the study. 
The main problem of utilizing olive cake is the continuous supply since it is a seasonal product. This problem could be solved by co-firing olive cake with other fuels such as coal, oil shale, and other biomass like date seed in industrial and utility boilers. Atimtay and Topal (2004) studied the co-combustion of Turkish olive cake with coal in a circulating FB of 125-mm diameter and 1800-mm height. The results suggest that olive cake is good fuel that can be mixed with coal for cleaner energy production in small-scale industries using CFB. 
Co-combustion of coal and olive oil waste has been investigated by Armesto et al. (2003). They used two different Spanish coals in their study. The results of their tests have shown that the combustion of olive cake/coal mixtures decreases the emissions of SO2 and NOx. Regarding date seed, Jordan has considerable amounts of date seed that may be utilized as renewable energy source. Saudi Arabia and Iraq, which are Jordan neighbor countries, produce about two million tons of date per year. The date seed waste represents around 15% of those quantities by weight. 
Hussain, Farooq, and Bassyouni (2014) studied the utilization of Saudi Arabian Date Palm waste through pyrolysis process. They did Thermogravimetric analysis to understand the pyrolysis behavior of palm date wastes and designed an FB to study hydrodynamics and develop optimum conditions for the pyrolysis of palm wastes. The pyrolysis is used to produce activated carbon and the waste can also be readily converted to liquid phenolic products. Experimental results have indicated potential opportunities of using the date biomass waste as a potential fuel in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Joardder, Shazib Uddin, and Nurul Islam (2011) studied the conversion of date seed waste into activated carbon and bio-fuel by fixed bed pyrolysis reactor. The date seeds in particle form were pyrolyzed in an externally heated fixed bed reactor with nitrogen as the carrier gas. A maximum liquid yield of 50 wt% and char of 30 wt% were obtained at a reactor bed temperature of 500¡ãC with a running time of 120 min. The oil is found to possess favorable flash point and reasonable density and viscosity. Al Asfar et al. (2016) developed a two-dimensional (2D) mathematical model to analyze the combus-tion process of Jordanian oil shale in a circulating FB burner. They found that the adiabatic flame temperature was 1080 K, while the obtained experimental results of maximum temperature at various locations of the vertical burner in an actual, non-adiabatic, non-stoichiometric combustion reached 950 K. Hammad and Al Asfar (2017) performed a comparative theoretical and experimental study on the direct burning processes of oil shale and coal in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion unit. 
They solved using Ansys/Fluent the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy, and mass diffusion using finite-volume method. They validated their model by comparing their theoretical results with experimental ones. They found that the adiabatic flame temperature was 1080 K for oil shale compared with 2260 K for coal. 
In this work, the adiabatic temperature, lower heating value, air fuel ratio, and effect of burner¡¯s length on minimizing combustion pollutant gases are investigated theoretically. An existing direct burning unit of 3-kW power was used to conduct experimental work to evaluate the values of temperature at certain locations during combustion process of the biomass and other selected solid fuels. The temperature values were also recorded during actual burning of oil shale and solid waste bio mass, and compared with theoretical values. A developed 2D mathematical model was used to represent the physical model of the combustion process and solve the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy, mass diffusion, and chemical combustion reactions kinetics numeri-cally using finite-volume method. The simulation was performed using ANSYS/Fluent software in order to estimate maximum temperature, heating values, and pollutants concentrations. The obtained results are important to investigate the possibility of using biomass as an alternative energy source in olive-and date-producing countries. 
Composition and thermophysical properties 
The elemental composition of date seed and olive cake in terms of the molar percentages of C, H, O, N, and S components was determined experimentally. The proximate composition in terms of moisture, volatile, fixed carbon, and ash fractions was also determined. Thermal conductivity test equipment and bomb calorimeter were used to determine the thermal conductivity and heating value. Table 1 shows the results of proximate and ultimate analyses of date seed and olive cake in addition to experimentally estimated thermophysical properties(Al Asfar et al. 2016; Hammad and Al Asfar 2017). 
Physical model 
The physical model consists of an experimental combustion unit composed of a 0.5-m diameter, 3-m-height vertical combustion chamber, two 0.3-m-diameter cyclones, and temperature measurement system. Figure 1 represents a 3D sketch of the burner used in this study. For more details on the combustion unit, see (Al Asfar et al. 2016).

Experimental work 
The combustion of olive cake and date seed was investigated experimentally under excess air condition. Temperature measurement was achieved using 11 k-type thermocouples distributed along burner length. Thermocouples were connected to an LAB view unit with interference designed for this project. Gas Analyzer Nova Plus with serial number (012293) was used for exhaust gases analysis. Continues combustion was noted for both biomass fuels. 
To validate the simulation model, the maximum temperature resulted from biomass model is compared to the maximum temperature obtained experimentally in the experimental combustion burner unit. The maximum temperature of 962 K was measured experimentally using the burner unit, which is close to the result of the simulation (1080 K). The difference from theoretical results for temperature is due to the fact that in the actual burning process the combustion efficiency was not 100%, and the process was not adiabatic due to heat transfer from the burner to surroundings. In addition to presence of certain percentage of excess air which cause reducing of combustion temperature. 
Mathematical model 
The mathematical model represents the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy, mass diffusion, and chemical combustion reaction kinetics. Those equations were solved numerically using a high-resolution mesh accounting for the solid and gaseous phases, k ¨C ¦Å turbulence, non-premixed combustion model, and reacting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with the same dimension and material of the experimental combustion burner of this study (Al Asfar et al. 2016). 
The burner mesh was created with two velocity inlet surfaces: one for the air at 2 m/s and the other for the fuel with a flow rate of 0.01 kg/s. In addition to one pressure outlet surface at the exhaust, and three wall-surfaces with a temperature of 1000 K for the combustion chamber walls. Non-premixed combustion model was selected since the fuel and the oxidizer enter the chamber in distinct streams. Non-adiabatic system was also assumed, which requires the solution for the modeled transport equation for time average enthalpy (Kunii and Levenspiel 1991): 
where Sh accounts for source terms due to radiation, heat transfer to wall boundary, and heat exchange with the second phase, and the total enthalpy is defined as follows: 
where Yj is the mass fraction of species j, and is the formation enthalpy of species j at the reference temperature Tref,j. The turbulent viscosity is solved using the k ¦Å model that 
where k and ¦Å are obtained from the transport equations and C¦Ì is constant. 
The mole fractions of oil shale species during the combustion process were estimated using probability density function (PDF) module integrated in ANSYS/Fluent software. Then, a discrete particle model (DPM) in 3D steady-state space is used to solve numerically the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy, and mass diffusion to estimate species fraction before and throughout combustion, temperature, radiation, convection heat transfer, pressure, density, etc. The chemical reversible reactions involving those species during combustion were taken into account (Al Asfar et al. 2016). Those species include C, H, N, O, S, C(s),S(s),CH4,H2, CO, CO2,N2,O2, OH, H2O, HS, H2S, SO, SO2,CS2, NO, NO2, and C2H6. The chemical reversible reactions involving these species during combustion were taken into account, since they are already built in fluent PDF module. Thermal, prompt, and fuel NOx formation were taken into account, in addition to thermal SOx which was computed through the simulation by enabling NOx and SOx modules. 
Results 
The following set of figures presents obtained results of direct burning of olive cake, date seed, oil shale and coal for flame temperature, and discrete particle module of solid combustion. In Figures 2 and 3, the devolatilization rate contours for date seed and olive cake show that volatiles are released with a maximum rate of 1.8 g/s, leading to slightly downstream of solid fuel feeding position. Volatiles were released slower in date seed with a rate of 0.5 g/s. Both biomass fuels have faster devolatilization rate as compared with oil shale, 0.125 g/s (Al Asfar et al. 2016). After completing devolatilization, the burnout started with a maximum rate of 0.0746, 0.0119, and 0.0123 g/s for olive cake, date seed, and oil shale, respectively. Burnout rate for date seed was the slowest, whereas burnout rate for coal was the fastest. 
Figures 4 and 5 show the temperature distribution in the FB burner for olive cake and date seed, respectively. The maximum temperature of olive cake combustion was 1380 K, while the average bed temperature was about 950 K, which represents a good agreement with experimental results. On the other hand, the maximum temperature of date seed combustion was 839 K in flame front, then decreased to 761 K. The experimental results showed that the maximum temperatures were 1126 K and 723 K for olive cake and date seed, respectively.

The maximum temperatures for all three alternative fuels were much lower than that for coal, which is 2260 K (Hammad and Al Asfar 2017). 
The maximum carbon dioxide CO2 mass fractions were 5.9%, 3.74%, and 3.8% for olive cake, date seed, and oil shale, respectively. The contour lines for CO2 mass fraction differ according to the burnout shape, while the concentration of CO was reduced from 8.01 PPM at the flame to <0.801 PPM at the exit. The results also show that the maximum concentration of produced SOx and NOx may not be taken into account when environmental effects are considered. 
Based on obtained results, it may be suggested that it requires about 1.5 tons of biomass (olive cake and date seed) to obtain the same energy produced from 1 ton of coal. This increase in mass will not be in coal favour; since the price of waste biomass in Jordan is about one tenth of coal price. Thus, the use of biomass will save around 40% of fuel cost. In terms of pollution, biomass produces very little sulfur and carbon oxides: SOx and NOx, which will have no serious effects on environment or health. On the other hand, the lower heating value was 16,400 kJ/kg and 19,500 kJ/kg for date seed and olive cake, and 29,000 kJ/kg and 7000 kJ/kg for coal and oil shale, respectively.
