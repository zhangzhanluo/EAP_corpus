Abstract
Dynamic stall is an incredibly rich fluid dynamics problem that manifests
itself on an airfoil during rapid, transient motion in which the angle of incidence
surpasses the static stall limit. It is an important element of many
manmade and natural flyers, including helicopters and supermaneuverable
aircraft, and low–Reynolds number flapping-wing birds and insects. The
fluid dynamic attributes that accompany dynamic stall include an eruption of
vorticity that organizes into a well-defined dynamic stall vortex and massive
excursions in aerodynamic loads that can couple with the airfoil structural
dynamics. The dynamic stall process is highly sensitive to surface roughness
that can influence turbulent transition and to local compressibility effects
that occur at free-stream Mach numbers that are otherwise incompressible.
Under some conditions, dynamic stall can result in negative aerodynamic
damping that leads to limit-cycle growth of structural vibrations and rapid
mechanical failure. The mechanisms leading to negative damping have been
a principal interest of recent experiments and analysis. Computational fluid
dynamic simulations and low-order models have not been good predictors
so far. Large-eddy simulation could be a viable approach although it remains
computationally intensive. The topic is technologically important owing to
the desire to develop next-generation rotorcraft that employ adaptive rotor
dynamic stall control.
1. BACKGROUND
Largely because of the helicopter application, dynamic stall has been an active research topic
in fluid dynamics for more than 60 years. However, its foundation dates back nearly 90 years,
with the origins of classical unsteady aerodynamics that include Wagner (1925), Glauert & Holl
(1929), and Theodorsen (1935), who developed analytic solutions to incompressible flow around
thin airfoils undergoing time-dependent motions. Other early contributions were from K¨ ussner
(1936), von K´arm´an&Sears (1938), Sears (1941), and Lomax (1953), who analyzed unsteady aerodynamics
problems associated with oscillating wings, sinusoidal vertical gusts, and compressible
flow, respectively. Kramer (1932) was one of the first to experimentally document the augmented
lift associated with dynamic stall. Bailey & Gustafson (1939) and Gustafson & Myers (1946) used
tufts and a blade-mounted camera on an autogyro rotor blade to document dynamic stall, which
they found to occur on the retreating blade during forward flight.
Figure 1 illustrates the dynamic stall process that occurs on an airfoil oscillating about its
quarter-chord location. Figure 1a shows the aerodynamic loads and pitch moment during the
pitching cycle, and Figure 1b shows the flow field structure during the pitching cycle that was
visualized with particle streak lines introduced at an upstream location.
The conditions in Figure 1 exemplify deep dynamic stall, which occurs when the maximum
angle of attack, α0 + α1, of the pitching motion exceeds the steady airfoil stall angle of attack, αss.
Here α0 denotes the mean angle of attack, and α1 denotes the pitch amplitude. This results in a
fully developed dynamic stall vortex-shedding phenomenon (McCroskey 1981) that produces large
peak aerodynamic loads and severe cycle hysteresis. The nomenclature is intended to differentiate
this condition from that of light dynamic stall, which occurs for lower peak angles of attack and
for which the peaks in the aerodynamic forces and pitch moment are less severe.
At the start of the pitch-up portion of the cycle (stage 1 in Figure 1), the boundary layer on
the suction surface of the airfoil (upper surface in the flow visualization) is attached, and the lift
force increases linearly with the pitch angle. This continues to the point at which the pitch angle
reaches the steady airfoil stall angle of attack, αss. The lift then continues to increase beyond
αss as a result of two mechanisms: (a) a delay in the boundary layer separation owing to the
pitching motion and (b) the formation of a closed separation bubble near the leading edge of the
airfoil.
The delay in the boundary layer separation is attributed to two effects. One is an increase in
the effective camber that is predicted from quasi-steady thin airfoil theory when α˙ > 0 (Leishman
2000). The other is the acceleration of the boundary layer due to the Magnus effect produced by
the motion of the leading edge (Ericsson & Reding 1984, 1988). Carta (1971) showed analytically
that the adverse pressure gradient over the suction side of a pitching airfoil was less than that of
a steady airfoil. The adverse pressure gradient is further attenuated as the pitch rate increases.
Walker et al. (1985) added that increasing the pitch rate promoted a stronger static pressure
suction peak at the leading edge that ultimately led to a more energetic dynamic stall vortex.
Stage 2 of the flow development corresponds to the first appearance and subsequent growth
of the dynamic stall vortex. This involves the spontaneous generation and ejection of vorticity
from the boundary layer into the inviscid outer flow in a process detailed by van Dommelen &
Shen (1980). The growth of the dynamic stall vortex results in additional aerodynamic loading
that exceeds that of the steady airfoil.
The onset of dynamic stall on a pitching airfoil can involve a number of mechanisms that depend
on Reynolds and Mach numbers. These include (a) the bursting or breakdown of the separation
bubble, (b) an abrupt breakdown of the boundary layer reverse flow within the separation bubble,
and (c) boundary layer–shock interaction that causes flow separation.

Certain stall situations, particularly on airfoils that coincide with thin airfoil theory, exhibit a
sudden breakdown of the laminar separation bubble owing to turbulent transition ( Johnson &
Ham 1972). McCroskey et al. (1976, 1981) extensively studied this process at lower Mach numbers
at which shock waves were not in play. In these experiments, the authors documented two alternate
scenarios for the onset of dynamic stall. The first involved trailing-edge stall in which separated
flow originating at the trailing edge gradually moved forward as the airfoil pitched upward. In
this case, the dynamic stall vortex formed aft of the maximum thickness point of the airfoil, never
reaching the leading edge.
The second scenario also originated at the trailing edge. It was manifest by a boundary layer
flow reversal that moved forward over the suction side of the airfoil. The occurrence of reverse
flow in the near-wall region of the boundary layer without the occurrence of large-scale separation
emphasizes the importance of not using the criterion of zero-skin friction as a separation indicator
in the pitching airfoil flow field (Reynolds&Carr 1985). The flow reversal was documented to have
little effect on the turbulent boundary layer or aerodynamic behavior until the forward motion
reached the maximum thickness point of the airfoil. Immediately thereafter, if not concurrently, the
turbulent boundary layer separated and abruptly moved upstream and downstream. This initiated
a dynamic stall vortex near the leading edge. McAlister & Carr (1979) and Lee & Gerontakos
(2004) observed a similar scenario.
Doligalski et al. (1994) comprehensively reviewed work focused on both the process leading to
the development of the dynamic stall vortex and its subsequent detachment from the airfoil surface.
The authors noted the proclivity of laminar boundary layers to develop a sharply focused eruption
of vortical fluid from the surface in the presence of an adverse pressure gradient. In pitching
airfoils at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, several studies suggested that the initiation of the
dynamic stall vortex appears to be associated with a similar viscous/inviscid interaction in the form
of the sudden eruption of a thin plume of vortical fluid from the surface that subsequently deflects
downstream and undergoes roll-up. Reynolds & Carr (1985) discussed the buildup of localized
boundary layer vorticity preceding dynamic stall in terms of a balance between the self-induced
upstream propagation of boundary layer vorticity and its downstream advection by the external
flow. The strong favorable pressure gradient near the airfoil leading edge of a pitching airfoil
introduces large amounts of vorticity into the boundary layer on the forward portion of the airfoil
concurrent with a decreasing external velocity over the aft portion. This sets the stage for a critical
localized accumulation of vorticity just aft of the suction peak.
At higher free-stream Mach numbers, the locally supercritical levels over the pitching airfoils
become the trigger for dynamic stall. This was evident from the experiments of McCroskey et al.
(1981), who found that a group of airfoils that exhibited one of the two trailing-edge dynamic
stall scenarios at lower free-stream Mach numbers showed leading-edge dynamic stall at a higher
free-stream Mach number in which supersonic flow occurred over the suction surface (Carr et al.
1982; McAlister et al. 1982; McCroskey et al. 1981, 1982). Chandrasekhara et al. (1998a) found
that complex interactions between the separation bubble and weak shock waves in the supersonic
region initiated the dynamic stall. At higher Mach numbers, M∞ > 0.45, the extent of the
supersonic region over the pitching airfoil was found to considerably increase. Strong normal
shock waves were observed to form. These led to an abrupt thickening and subsequent separation
of the boundary layer flow. Chandrasekhara et al. (1998a) observed that an oblong vortical structure
formed after the shock. Thus, the shock-induced flow separation was the origin of the dynamic
stall vortex. The laminar separation bubble that formed near the leading edge was observed to be
present but played no role in the development of the dynamic stall vortex.
In stage 3 of the flow development shown in Figure 1, the fully formed dynamic stall vortex
convects over the suction side of the pitching airfoil. This motion of the low-pressure vortex core
shifts the airfoil center of pressure toward the trailing edge, resulting in an acute nose-down pitch
moment, referred to as moment stall. This occurs shortly after the dynamic stall vortex forms
(Harris et al. 1970). The moment stall precedes the lift stall. The time lag between the moment
stall and lift stall correlates with the time needed for the dynamic stall vortex to convect past the
trailing edge (Bousman 1998).
The low-pressure core of the dynamic stall vortex also augments the aerodynamic suction
on the airfoil, increasing the lift compared to a steady airfoil. The amount of lift enhancement,
however, is decreased at compressible Mach numbers. The added lift drops sharply when the
dynamic stall vortex convects off the airfoil and the flow is fully separated. This signifies stage 4
of the flow development.
In stage 5 of the flow development, the pitch-down motion of the airfoil causes the flow to
begin to reattach. This begins at the leading edge and gradually proceeds to the trailing edge. As
the flow attaches, there is a shift in the aerodynamic load distribution toward the leading edge,
which restores the positive pitch moment.
Recovery from dynamic stall is somewhat of a stochastic process in which significant differences
in aerodynamic loading can occur from one pitch cycle to the next (Green & Galbraith 1995,
Wernert et al. 1996, Young 1981). Liiva & Davenport (1969) proposed that these differences
resulted from random features of the separated shear layer. This was later supported through
particle image velocimetry measurements by Shih et al. (1992) and Wernert et al. (1996), who
observed that the separated shear layer contained nonrepeated patterns of vortical structures from
one cycle to the next. Werner et al. further remarked that the nonreproducible nature depended
on the size of the separated shear region and the reduced frequency of the pitching motion. The
cycle-to-cycle variations could be smoothed out through ensemble averaging correlated with the
pitching motion. McAlister et al. (1982) observed that 50 pitch cycles were sufficient to yield
converged statistics.
Early rotor dynamic stall investigations focused on aeroelastic issues such as stall flutter (Brooks
& Baker 1958, Ham 1966, Zvara & Ham 1960). Ham & Garelick (1968) were the first to realize
the vortical nature of rotor blade dynamic stall. The signature of “very concentrated positive
vorticity” was captured in surface pressure measurements that revealed a dynamic low-pressure
region that formed near the leading edge and convected toward the trailing edge. Integrating
the pressure distribution around the rotor section to obtain the aerodynamic forces revealed a
severe hysteresis in the pitch moment that could couple with the pitching motion and result in
negative aerodynamic damping. Ham (1968) later linked the dynamic stall phenomenon with the
occurrence of stall flutter.
Following Ham (1967), investigators sought to identify the underlying mechanisms for stall
onset delay of a pitching airfoil that could lead to analytic or empirical models for predicting
the aerodynamic loads. At the same time, theories for unsteady flow separation developed that
highlighted fundamental differences between steady and unsteady boundary layers (Haller 2004,
Sears & Telionis 1975, Telionis 1970, van Dommelen & Shen 1980).
The early dynamic stall research almost exclusively focused on incompressible Mach numbers.
However, McCroskey et al. (1981, 1982) showed that the local Mach number near the leading
edge of pitching airfoils can be three to five times higher than that in the free stream. As a
result, incompressible free-stream Mach numbers as low as 0.18 could result in supercritical Mach
numbers over the airfoil. Carr & Chandrasekhara (1992) have particularly focused on the effect
of compressibility on dynamic stall.
1.1. Dynamic Stall Regimes
As mentioned above, the conditions shown in Figure 1 correspond to deep dynamic stall. This
follows the nomenclature set by McCroskey (1981), who divided dynamic stall into four categories:
no stall, stall onset, light stall, and deep stall. Although the majority of dynamic stall research has
focused on deep stall, it is avoided in normal rotorcraft operation owing to the severe forces
and vibrations that occur in this condition (Carr & Chandrasekhara 1996). McCroskey (1981)
delineated the stall regimes based on the maximum angle of attack, αmax = α0 + α1.
1.1.1. No stall. In the no-stall regime, the airfoil trajectory remains below the static stall angle
of attack, αss. Under these conditions, the aerodynamic loads are predicted well by quasi-steady
aerodynamic theory.
1.1.2. Stall onset. Stall onset is the regime in which the airfoil trajectory reaches the static stall
angle of attack. This condition produces the maximum useful lift without excessive drag or pitch
moment. Again, under these conditions, the aerodynamic loads are predicted well by quasi-steady
aerodynamic theory.
1.1.3. Light stall. The light-stall regime marks the first development of a dynamic stall vortex.
The onset, growth, and convection of the vortex are sensitive to the airfoil chord Reynolds number
and free-stream Mach number, as well as the unsteady parameters, including the pitching reduced
frequency, k, and α0 and α1. Lift and moment stall peaks are less severe in this regime. The flow
separation region is on the order of the airfoil thickness (McCroskey 1981). The boundary between
stall onset and light stall is abrupt and can be identified by the first appearance of moment stall.
1.1.4. Deep stall. In the deep-stall regime, the dynamic stall vortex is strongly developed. The
aerodynamic loads fluctuate dramatically through the pitching cycle with large peak forces and
strong hysteresis. The aerodynamic loads exhibit little sensitivity to Reynolds number, airfoil
geometry, or pitching motion. The flow separation region in this case is on the order of the airfoil
chord length (McCroskey et al. 1981).
1.2. Compressibility Effects
Compressibility affects the dynamic stall process of a pitching airfoil in a number of ways. This has
been the topic of many research efforts, including those by Carr & Chandrasekhara (1991, 1992,
1996), Carr et al. (1994), Chandrasekhara et al. (1993, 1998a), Dyken et al. (1996), and Bowles
(2012). Below we summarize the major effects compressibility has on the different elements of the
dynamic stall process.
1.2.1. Stall delay. Typically at M∞ > 0.3, but possibly as low as M∞ = 0.18, the locally
supersonic flow over the pitching airfoil reduces the flow acceleration around the leading edge,
thereby reducing the flow separation delay and the peak lift and pitch moment coefficients. This
is, however, a steady effect and is not related to the unsteady motion of the airfoil. For the same
pitching motion reduced frequency, the stall penetration, αds − αss, remains nearly constant with
increasing Mach number (Bowles 2012). Here αds denotes the dynamic lift stall angle.
1.2.2. Aerodynamic damping. At higher Mach numbers, the attached flow significantly lags
behind the pitching motion, so the hysteresis in the aerodynamic loads between pitch-up and pitchdown
increases withM∞. As discussed in more detail below, this directly impacts the aerodynamic
damping. In this way, compressibility acts in a similar manner as the pitching reduced frequency.
1.2.3. Shock-induced stall. Local compressible Mach numbers over the pitching airfoil initially
promote leading-edge dynamic stall through incipient separation bubble bursting. At higher freestream
Mach numbers, shock-induced dynamic stall becomes the overriding mechanism.
1.2.4. Stall vortex strength. Compressibility effects weaken the strength of the dynamic stall
vortex. This reduces the vortex-induced suction pressures on the airfoil. This is closely related to

helicopter (b). Figure adapted with permission from Bousman (1998).
the decrease in the gestation period and residence time of the dynamic stall vortex. Although the
magnitude of the induced pressures decreases with increasing Mach number, the dynamic range
of pressure coefficients on the airfoil, Cp/Cpmin , increases with increasing Mach number. This
generally has a marginal impact on the lift and drag forces. However, it has a significant effect
on the pitch moment, with the outcome being an increase in the cycle-averaged aerodynamic
damping with increasing Mach number (Bowles 2012).
1.3. Helicopter Rotor Aerodynamics
The helicopter rotor flow field features complex, time-varying blade angles of attack, out-of-plane
mechanical and elastic rotor blade motion, unsteady boundary layers, massive flow separation,
vortex blade interaction, and varying inflow velocity. Each of these affects the rotor aerodynamic
performance and may contribute to excessive loading, mechanical vibration, and aerodynamic
noise generation (Conlisk 2001). To compound the flow complexity, the rotor blade may experience
instantaneous local Mach numbers, Ml , that are incompressible, Ml < 0.2, transonic,
0.7 ≤ Ml ≤ 1, or supersonic, Ml > 1, within a single rotor rotation (Leishman 2000, Liiva &
Davenport 1969, McCroskey et al. 1976).
Figure 2a illustrates the rotor disk for a helicopter in forward flight with velocity, Uff. The
rotor blade is considered to be rotating at a constant angular velocity of ω. The angular position of
the rotor is denoted by ψ. For 0◦ ≤ ψ ≤ 180◦, the rotor blade is moving opposite to the direction
of the relative airflow caused by forward flight and therefore is experiencing local velocities that
are larger than Uff . This is referred to as the advancing blade. For the other half of the rotation,
180◦ ≤ ψ ≤ 0◦, the motion is in the direction of the relative airflow caused by forward flight;
therefore, the blade experiences local velocities that are less than Uff. This is referred to as the
retreating blade. The lift generated on the advancing blade must be the same as on the retreating
blade; therefore, the angle of attack on the retreating blade must be larger than that on the
advancing blade. As a result, the rotor blade oscillates in pitch as it rotates from the advancing
to retreating sides of the rotor disk. This provides one major motivation for the pitching airfoil
research discussed above.
The main parameter governing the unsteady nature of the pitching rotor blade is the reduced
frequency, k = π f c /Uff, where f is the physical pitching frequency, and c is the rotor blade chord
length. The reduced frequency of the pitching motion represents the ratio of timescales associated
with the unsteady pitch motion to that of the free-stream convection (Leishman 2000). For k = 0,
the flow is steady. For 0 < k < 0.05, the unsteady effects are generally small and can be neglected,
provided the pitch amplitude is not too large. For k ≥ 0.05, the flow field is considered to be
unsteady. If k ≥ 0.2, the flow field is considered to be highly unsteady. The reduced frequency
can also be thought of as a phase lag parameter in which the fluid reaction lags behind the pitching
motion owing to the inertial effects. Larger reduced frequencies correspond to an increased
phase lag between the pitching and fluid motions. In general, the reduced frequency is constantly
changing on the helicopter rotor because of the local inflow dependence on Uff. As a result, it is a
somewhat ambiguous parameter with regard to the unsteadiness associated with helicopter rotor
aerodynamics (Leishman 2000). However, in wind-tunnel experiments, the reduced frequency is
a constant value for a fixed combination of pitching frequency and free-stream speed.
Dynamic stall most commonly occurs on the retreating side of the rotor disk (Harris et al. 1970,
Tarzanin 1972, Young 1981), although there is some evidence of dynamic stall on the advancing
rotor (Bousman 1998). Bousman (1998) found that stall events occurred at multiple sites during
flight tests of a UH-60A helicopter. Figure 2b shows a map of these events in the rotor disk plane.
Although the majority of the rotor stall did occur on the retreating blade side, some stall events
occurred in the first quadrant (0◦ ≤ ψ ≤ 90◦) of the advancing blade.
The potential for dynamic stall depends on the rotor blade loading, which is the ratio of the rotor
thrust coefficient to the rotor solidity,CT /σ , and the flight speed. Increased blade loading results in
increased dynamic stall. However, at lower blade loading, increased forward flight speed promotes
an increase in dynamic stall. Helicopter performance boundaries are defined by the rotor dynamic
stall. The dependent variables are the blade loading, CT /σ , and the advance ratio, μ = Uff/R,
which is the ratio of the flight speed to the rotor blade tip speed. At high advance ratios, dynamic
stall can occur on the advancing blade owing to shock formation (Martin et al. 2008).
The practical outcome of dynamic stall on the rotor is an increase in unsteady loads on the
rotor that are subsequently transmitted to the rotor hub and control system. In some cases, the
conditions of dynamic stall can lead to negative damping that results in a limit-cycle growth of
rotor displacements. This phenomenon is referred to as stall flutter (Ham & Young 1966), which
can lead to catastrophic mechanical failure of the rotor.
2. AERODYNAMIC DAMPING AND STALL FLUTTER
Stall flutter is a single-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic motion that results from negative system
(combined aerodynamic and structural) damping. On a helicopter, it appears as a limit-cycle
growth in amplitude of rotor torsional oscillations at the torsional natural frequency (Fung 2008).
This can drive other modes of vibration of the rotor as well. For a helicopter, limit-cycle oscillations
triggered on the retreating blade side are often damped as the flow reattaches on the advancing
blade side (Ham & Young 1966). However, if the aerodynamic damping on the advancing side is
near zero, successive rotations of the rotor through negatively damped retreating blade regions
can lead to unchecked, additive limit-cycle growth to excessive amplitudes (Bowles 2012).
The stability of the air load system has been traditionally quantified through the aerodynamic
damping coefficient, 	cycle, derived by Carta&Niebanck (1969) and Oates (1989). The derivation
considers a single-degree-of-freedom structure subject to harmonic forcing in a uniform airstream.
The cycle aerodynamic damping is given as

where CW is the normalized energy transfer between the airstream and airfoil, and Cmc /4 is the

Equation 1 can be experimentally computed from the area enclosed in the cycle variation in
the pitch moment coefficient, Cmc /4 (α), namely,

where the superscripts U and D denote the upward and downward angle of attack motion of the
airfoil, respectively.
For Theodorsen’s model of a thin airfoil (flat plate) undergoing pure pitch oscillations about its
quarter-chord location in a potential flow field, the aerodynamic damping is (Carta & Niebanck
1969)
	cycle = πk/2. (3)
When the maximum angle of attack in the pitching cycle is below the static stall angle of attack, αss,
the aerodynamic loads and moments are predicted well by Theodorsen’s (1935) method. Under
these conditions, the aerodynamic damping coefficient is always positive and linearly dependent
on the reduced frequency, k, as given in Equation 3.
If the airfoil pitching range is such that its maximum angle of attack exceeds αss by a few degrees,
then light dynamic stall ensues (McCroskey 1982). Figure 3a depicts the moment coefficient
during a pitch cycle for light stall. McCroskey et al. (1981) found that light dynamic stall had
the largest tendency to produce unstable aerodynamic loading on helicopter rotor sections. As
indicated in Figure 3, clockwise loops in the moment coefficient trajectory are associated with
negative damping. Counterclockwise loops lead to positive damping.
Deep stall occurs when the maximum angle of attack during the pitching cycle far exceeds αss
(McCroskey 1982). Figure 3b illustrates the moment coefficient during a pitch cycle undergoing
deep stall. Based on the cycle-averaged damping, deep stall is generally more aerodynamically
stable than light dynamic stall. This is apparent in Figure 3 in which the clockwise moment
coefficient loop for light stall is much larger than that for deep stall.
Bowles (2012) and Bowles et al. (2012, 2014) developed a formulation for a time-resolved
aerodynamic damping coefficient. This involved the use of the discrete Hilbert transform of the
pitch moment and incidence time series. The integral Hilbert transform of a data series y(t),
denoted here as ˜y(t), is defined as
˜y(t) ≡ H[y(t)] = −1

where H is the Hilbert operator, and ℘ denotes the Cauchy principal value of the improper
integral.
The single-degree-of-freedom equation of motion (EOM) for a pitching airfoil semichord b
in a uniform airstream is
πρb4α¨ (t) + h∗(t)α˙ (t) + κ
∗(t)α(t) = M(t), (5)
where h∗(t) = hR(t) + ihI (t) = ¯h(t)eiγ1(t) is the viscous damping moment, κ
∗(t) = κR(t) + iκI (t) =
κ¯ (t)eiγ2(t) is the aerodynamic stiffness, and M(t) is the pitch moment. This EOM can account for
nonlinearities inherent to the dynamic stall problem, unlike formulations that rely on constant
amplitude, constant phase damping, or stiffness (Oates 1989). Both h∗(t) and κ
∗(t) contribute to
the total aerodynamic damping.
Substitution of the polar representations of h∗ and κ
∗ into Equation 5 yields

h0 ≡ ¯h /2πρb4, (7)
and the undamped natural frequency, ω0, is
ω0 ≡

κ¯ /πρb4. (8)
In this formulation, the instantaneous pitch angle, α, its derivatives, and the instantaneous pitch
moment, M, remain time dependent.
To employ the Hilbert transform analysis, one replaces each term in Equation 6 by its analytic
signal counterpart found through the Hilbert transform; this generates the new EOM

Substituting A,M, and the first and second derivatives of A into Equation 9, and equating the
imaginary parts, one obtains
As defined by Carta&Niebanck (1969), the left-hand side of Equation 10 is the total aerodynamic

pitch moment and the prescribed angle of attack determines the sign of the aerodynamic damping;
its form is identical to previous derivations of the aerodynamic damping (Bisplinghoff et al. 1955,
Oates 1989, Rainey 1957). Furthermore, it remains that a phase lag, ψ(t) < 0, produces positive
damping, whereas ψ(t) > 0 indicates negative damping or a local exchange of energy from the
airstream to the airfoil.	reflects the stability of the pitch moment, which in turn is a manifestation
of the developing pressure field. An unstable pitch moment, 	 < 0, implies unstable pressure
loading and can be described as a necessary, aerodynamic condition to excite the stall flutter of an
elastic body.
The novelty of the approach, unlike previous investigations of aerodynamic damping that rely
on 	cycle, is that Equation 12 allows one to calculate the intracycle aerodynamic damping. The

2.1. Attached Flow
The cycle-integrated damping, 	cycle, for attached flow has been documented to increase with
increasing Mach number (Lorber et al. 1992). In fact, this increase can be modeled by typical
compressibility corrections, for example, the Prandtl-Glauert rule (Bowles 2012), up to the formation
of shocks on the airfoil upper surface. When shocks form, the cycle-integrated damping
rapidly increases. This cycle-averaged statistic, however, masks the complete physics that includes
negatively damped portions of the pitch cycle that could promote unstable flutter.
As an illustration of this behavior, Figure 4 depicts the Hilbert transform–based damping
analysis for two experimental runs of nearly equal stall penetration (αmax − αss ≈ −1.1◦) but at
low– and high–subsonic Mach number conditions. Figure 4a,d shows the pitch moment variation
with incidence. In each of these panels, Cm denotes the data series obtained by spatial integration
of the chordwise static pressures. These are ensemble-averaged quantities (≈100 cycles) chosen
in lieu of the instantaneous pitching moment to remove the cycle-to-cycle variations common
to the dynamic stall problem (Wernert et al. 1997). The Hilbert transform (˜Cm), in-phase (CmR ),
and quadrature (CmI ) pitch moments are also displayed. At M∞ = 0.2, the elliptic, counterclockwise
nature of the pitching moment is clearly seen. Figure 4b,e presents the polar representation
of the intracycle damping coefficient. In this representation, the radial component indicates the
magnitude of the damping, ACm (t)/α1, and the vector angle is the phase difference between the
aerodynamic pitch moment and the pitch motion, ψ(t) = φ(t)−ωt. Recall from Equation 12 that

positive, whereas in the first and second quadrants, the damping is negative. The polar representation
of the intracycle damping coefficient at M∞ = 0.2 shown in Figure 4b traces out only a
small region in the third quadrant, yielding the nearly constant (albeit noisy) positive intracycle
damping coefficient shown in Figure 4c.
At M∞ = 0.6, the pitch moment exhibits no crossovers, indicating no observable negative
damping, although the ellipse is clearly distorted. The distortion is a consequence of shock development
and the concomitant nose-up moment. This behavior causes the phase difference (Figure 4e)
to decrease and become positive at ωt = 0.83π (α = 7.5◦). This leads to a brief period of negative
aerodynamic damping. This negative damping is not observed in Figure 4d because of the much
larger magnitude of the positive damping during pitch-down over the same range of angle of
attack.
The destabilizing effect of shock formation is further illustrated in Figure 5, which shows
plots of the upper-surface pressures, pitch moment Cmc /4 , instantaneous angle of attack α, and
time-resolved damping 	(t) at M∞ = 0.6 and α = 4.0◦ − 4.4◦ cos ωt. For this case, as in the
M∞ = 0.6 case examined in Figure 4, localized, negative damping occurs during a portion of
the pitching cycle. The mechanism for the negative intracycle damping stems from the growth of
a λ shock during the pitch-up portion of the cycle. The position of the shock front was inferred
from the brief increase in the pressure captured by the onboard sensors. This shock wave was

also observed in high-speed schlieren images of the leading-edge flow field (Bowles 2012). The
destabilizing portion of the motion occurs after the streamwise propagation of the shock front
comes to a halt near the quarter-chord location. The destabilization results from a decrease in the
pressure upstream of the shock front that increases the leading-edge suction. This couples with
higher static pressure aft of the shock, which results in a nose-up pitch moment that is responsible

for a decrease in the aerodynamic damping at that phase in the pitching cycle. A similar decrease
in damping occurs during pitch-down, just prior to the shock front retreating to the leading edge.
Based upon examination of the minimum intracycle aerodynamic damping coefficient,	min, we
can summarize the effect of reduced frequency and the Mach number on the aerodynamic damping
characteristics of attached pitching flow as follows. (a) Regardless of the Mach number, increased
reduced frequency has a stabilizing influence (increasing positive aerodynamic damping). (b) At
any fixed reduced frequency, the effect of increasing the Mach number on the damping is minimal,
except when shocks begin to form on the suction surface. (c) Shock waves can produce negative
damping that could trigger stall flutter even in an attached pitching condition!
2.2. Light and Deep Dynamic Stall
As described above, dynamic stall occurs when the pitching motion exceeds the static stall angle
of attack, αss. This leads to the eruption of surface vorticity and the formation and downstream
convection of a dynamic stall vortex. The process results in large peak aerodynamic loads and
pitch moments and strong cycle hysteresis that directly affects the aerodynamic damping.
Figure 6a highlights the typical behavior of the cycle-averaged damping coefficient, 	cycle,
under light- and deep-stall conditions for different free-stream Mach numbers. Figure 6b singles
out five pitch moment cycles from the data set that have similar dynamic stall penetration at their
respective Mach numbers.
One can observe that the minimum damping in these cases occurred when the maximum angle
of attack, αmax = α0+α1, was approximately 2–3◦ past αss. This level of stall penetration classically
falls into the light dynamic stall regime described by McCroskey (1981). As the maximum incidence
increases to enter the deep-stall regime, the cycle damping becomes more positive, which is a result
of the strongly developed dynamic stall vortex (Carta & Niebanck 1969, Fung 2008). Similar
damping and Mach trends are reported by Liiva (1969).
One can observe the trend of increased damping with increasing Mach number in the accompanying
pitch moment cycles. Beginning at M∞ = 0.2, the clockwise rotation of the pitch moment
path for −2◦ ≤ (αds − αss) ≤ 2◦ is emblematic of an unstable damping coefficient (see Figure 3).
At higher Mach numbers, the pitch moment path direction in the vicinity of αss is decidedly counterclockwise,
which signifies positive damping. Moreover, the size of the moment hysteresis loop
decreases with increasing Mach number, which is consistent with an increase in positive cycle
damping with increasing Mach number, observed in Figure 6a.
Based on this assessment of the cycle-averaged damping, one might conclude that there is less
tendency for stall flutter under light and deep dynamic stall at higher Mach numbers. However,
the cycle-averaged statistics can conceal important physics that can lead to localized, unstable
damping during the dynamic stall process.
To demonstrate this, investigators analyzed three of the pitch moment cycles at M∞ = 0.2,
0.3, and 0.6 in Figure 6 using the Hilbert transform formulation to examine intracycle damping
characteristics. Figure 7a,c,e shows the polar representation of the aerodynamic damping for
the pitch cycle. Figure 7b,d,f simultaneously indicates the time-resolved damping, the ensemble
pitching moment, Cmc /4 , and the position of the dynamic stall vortex based on tracking the local
minimum in the suction-side surface pressure (Lorber & Carta 1988).
At the lower Mach number in Figure 7a, M∞ = 0.2, the phase ψ(t) at the start of pitch-up
(αmin) indicates that the aerodynamic damping is near zero or neutrally stable. As the airfoil pitches
up, ψ(t) moves into the second quadrant, indicating negative aerodynamic damping. During this
portion of the pitch-up cycle, the pitch moment amplitude, ACm (t), increases such that the polar
representation of the damping sweeps out a large area in the second quadrant corresponding to
negative damping.
The phase lead indicated by ψ(t) during pitch-up is a consequence of the induced stall delay
produced by a positive pitch rate (α˙ > 0) and an accompanying alleviation of the suction-surface
adverse pressure gradient. This allows the aerodynamic pitch moment to remain nearly constant as
the airfoil pitches up. The result is a steady increase in the negative damping throughout pitch-up,
as documented in Figure 7b.
The rate of negative damping is observed to accelerate at ωt = 3π/4. This portion of pitch-up
coincides with the initial formation of the dynamic stall vortex near the leading edge at x = 0.006.
The damping continues to become more negative up to the point at which the dynamic stall vortex
arrives at the quarter-chord (pitching) location (x = 0.25). This corresponds to ωt = 0.8π, where
(2	(t))/(πk) = −13.89.
As the dynamic stall vortex convects downstream past the quarter-chord location toward the
airfoil trailing edge, the aerodynamic damping begins to increase. The low (suction) pressure
that follows the position of the vortex loads the trailing edge and thereby produces a negative
(nose-down) pitch moment. For the M∞ = 0.2 case, the negative pitch-down moment induced
by the vortex persists into the pitch-down portion (α˙ < 0) of the cycle so that the aerodynamic
damping continues to be negative. Positive damping does not begin until ωt = 1.04π, where the
upper-surface flow field becomes completely separated.
To summarize these observations, we note the following: Large negative aerodynamic damping
that could spawn flutter occurs in a portion of the pitching cycle. Additionally, the source of
negative aerodynamic damping stems from the stall delay that results from the α˙ > 0 pitching
motion. Negative damping is also augmented by the formation of the dynamic stall vortex. Once
the dynamic stall vortex convects past the pitching location, its effect is stabilizing. After the
dynamic stall vortex convects past the trailing edge, the fully separated flow field initiates positive
aerodynamic damping. Finally, the positive damping reaches a maximum when the flow fully
reattaches.

0.046, and α = 5.4◦ − 5.1◦ cos ωt. Figure adapted with permission from Bowles et al. (2012).
As evident in Figure 6, the cycle-averaged damping coefficient for the pitching airfoil at
M∞ = 0.2 is negative. Therefore, it may not be surprising to find the large negative damping
peak in the time-resolved damping coefficient. However, in this case, the ratio 	min/	cycle is 7.73!
Thus, there exists a significant possibility for stall-flutter oscillations.
In contrast to the lower–Mach number case, at higher Mach numbers, the cycle-integrated
damping is always positive. Therefore, one would not expect these conditions to exhibit stall flutter.
However, the flight data shown in Figure 2b suggest otherwise. Figure 7c,d for M∞ = 0.3 and
Figure 7e,f for M∞ = 0.6 each reveal a negative peak in the intracycle damping that accompanies
the pitch-up motion of the airfoil. The intracycle damping for M∞ = 0.3 has all the same
characteristics as its M∞ = 0.2 counterpart. However, the magnitude of the negative damping
peak is not as large, which is attributed to a reduction in the time that the dynamic stall vortex
resides over the airfoil, as is evident by the x trajectory in Figure 7d.
At M∞ = 0.6, dynamic stall is triggered by shock waves on the suction surface of the airfoil.
The dynamic stall vortex in this case forms downstream of the shock front, at x = 0.134. This
is still upstream of the pitching location and therefore contributes a positive pitch moment that
results in a negative peak in the aerodynamic damping. The magnitude of the peak negative
damping coefficient is larger than that at M∞ = 0.3, which is a reversal of the previous trend with
increasing Mach number.
The x trajectory of the dynamic stall vortex in Figure 7f reveals a very gradual convection.
Chandrasekhara et al. (1994) found that the convection of the vortex in this instance is supplanted
by a near-constant-speed, low-pressure traveling gust that moves downstream. This gust fails to
induce the same positive aerodynamic damping that the dynamic stall vortex produced when it
traversed past the pitching location on the airfoil at the lower Mach numbers.
2.3. min versus cycle
For helicopter rotor operations, the magnitude of the minimum damping coefficient within the
pitch cycle, 	min, is potentially a more critical property than is the cycle-averaged damping coefficient,
	cycle. Local, negative intracycle aerodynamic damping, especially of the magnitude documented
by Bowles (2012) and Bowles et al. (2012, 2014), can spawn limit-cycle vibration growth
and possibly account for the stall-flutter-related divergence found during high-speed forward
flight or high g-force maneuvers (Bousman 1998). Bowles (2012) compared the cycle-averaged
and minimum intracycle aerodynamic damping coefficients for different dynamic stall regimes
over a range of Mach numbers from 0.2 to 0.6. For conditions in which the peak angle of attack
was less than the steady stall angle of attack, αmax < αss, the difference between 	min and 	cycle
was negligible across the whole Mach number regime. However, when αmax > αss, the minimum
intracycle damping was always significantly less than the cycle-averaged damping, and negative.
This was the case for the whole Mach number range.
2.4. Leading-Edge Turbulent Trip Effects
As discussed above, the pitch-up motion of the leading edge (α˙ > 0) results in an acceleration
of the boundary layer flow, which delays separation. In a similar manner, the flow acceleration
near the leading edge should make the boundary layer more stable to disturbances and therefore
suppress turbulent transition. McCroskey et al. (1981) noted that the nature of the boundary
layer separation that precedes vortex development strongly influences dynamic stall, and this is
particularly true in the light-stall regime. At least at Mach numbers below which dynamic stall is
influenced by shock waves, the transition state of the boundary layer (i.e., laminar versus turbulent)
should influence dynamic stall vortex inception and strength.
Effect of leading-edge trips on (a) cycle-averaged and (b) minimum intracycle damping coefficients for two Mach numbers. Roughness
consists of masking tape and 320- and 400-grit sandpaper strips. Data adapted from Bowles (2012).
With this in mind, there have been several studies on the effect of leading-edge turbulent
trips on dynamic stall (Bowles 2012, Chandrasekhara et al. 1996). Bowles (2012) examined the
effect of three turbulent trips consisting of strips of masking tape and strips of sandpaper of two
grit sizes. The turbulent trips were placed so that they overlaid the position of the leading-edge
flow separation bubble that formed just prior to stall on the static airfoil. This corresponded to
0.005 ≤ x ≤ 0.030. The surface visualization with the different trips showed that they eliminated
the separation bubble (Bowles 2012). Figure 8 summarizes the results, documenting the effect on
the cycle-averaged and intracycle damping coefficients.
Based on the conventional cycle-averaged damping coefficient, at the lower Mach number,
M∞ = 0.2, the leading-edge trips weakened the dynamic stall vortex (Bowles 2012), which resulted
in the cycle-integrated damping becoming positive. The distributed sand grain roughness was
found most effective. At M∞ = 0.6, dynamic stall vortex formation occurred downstream of the
shock front, which was at x = 0.134. The turbulent trips were therefore well upstream (x ≤ 0.03)
and, based on the cycle-averaged damping coefficient, had a minimal effect.
The minimum intracycle damping coefficients for the distributed roughness trips at M∞ = 0.2
support the cycle-averaged view, with a significant reduction in the negative damping peak that
is associated with the dynamic stall vortex formation. The edge roughness trip was found to be
much less effective. However, at M∞ = 0.6, at which the dynamic stall vortex forms downstream
of the shock, the distributed roughness trips result in significantly larger negative damping, which
is not indicated by the conventional cycle-averaged damping coefficient. For the two sandpaper
trips, for example, 	min ranges from −5 to −9, and 	cycle is nearly neutral. This reverse trend in
TRANSONIC GLOVE
Successful control of the detrimental effects associated with dynamic stall was achieved by Martin et al. (2008)
by use of a transonic leading-edge glove and passive vortex generator combination on a VR-7 airfoil. The vortex
generators were placed at x = 0.1. It is significant to note that neither the leading-edge glove nor the passive vortex
generators alone were successful at controlling dynamic stall. Their combination, however, reduced the local Mach
number, thereby enabling shock-free operation of the passive vortex generators. In the light-stall regime, this had
the effect of virtually eliminating the adverse pitching moment associated with dynamic stall for Mach numbers
up to 0.4. In the deep-stall regime, it significantly reduced adverse pitch moments at Mach numbers up to 0.375.
These results motivate the development of flush, surface-mounted active flow control devices that can mimic the
effect of passive vortex generators without incurring the adverse effects of shock formation. One recent approach
involves the plasma vortex generator demonstrated by Schatzman & Thomas (2010).
aerodynamic damping with turbulent trips at higher Mach numbers associated with the advancing
rotor merits watching as a possible trigger for stall flutter. In contrast, the edge roughness trip
had little effect on 	min at M∞ = 0.6.
3. DYNAMIC STALL CONTROL
The sensitivity of dynamic stall vortex formation and development to leading-edge turbulent trips
suggests that passive and active flow control could be an effective approach toward mitigating the
detrimental effect of dynamic stall. There have been several investigations of dynamic stall control
by both active and passive means, as described in the survey by Lorber et al. (2000). Candidate
control schemes include variable rotor geometry, leading-edge blowing (Greenblatt&Wygnanski
2001, Sun & Sheikh 1999, Weaver et al. 2004), leading-edge plasma actuation (Corke et al. 2011;
Lombardi 2011; Lombardi et al. 2013; Post & Corke 2006), vortex generators (Heine et al. 2011,
Martin et al. 2008, Traub et al. 2004), synthetic jets (Ekaterinaris 2002, Florea & Wake 2003,
Traub et al. 2004), and fixed-wing devices such as slots (Carr et al. 2001), leading-edge droop
(Chandrasekhara et al. 2004, Joo et al. 2006, Martin et al. 2008), pressure-side tabs (i.e., Gurney
flaps) (Chandrasekhara et al. 2004, Joo et al. 2006), and trailing-edge flaps (Feszty et al. 2004;
Gerontakos & Lee 2006, 2007, 2008).
One particularly notable experiment by Martin et al. (2008) examined passive streamwise vortex
generators for dynamic stall control at helicopter-relevant conditions. Figure 9 shows a photograph
of the transonic leading-edge glove and streamwise vortex generator (see the sidebar Transonic
Glove). Vane-type vortex generators were placed at x = 0.1 on a VR-7 airfoil that was also
fitted with a transonic leading-edge glove. These experiments were performed at Rec 	 2 × 106
and M∞ = 0.3−0.4. The experiments showed that vortex generators on the baseline airfoil were
not effective in dynamic stall control. Instead, they caused shock-induced dynamic stall in the
locally supersonic flow. Similarly, the transonic glove alone was also ineffective for dynamic stall
control. However, the combination of the transonic glove, which lowered the local Mach number,
and the vortex generators was found to be extremely effective at suppressing dynamic stall.
Measured pitch moment cycles exhibited a significant reduction or elimination of moment stall
with the transonic glove and streamwise vortex generator combination. However, the effectiveness
of the transonic glove and passive vortex generator combination still diminished at Mach
numbers above M∞ = 0.3−0.4, most likely as a result of shocks created by the passive vortex
generator.

At helicopter-relevant conditions, it would appear that any flow control approach that geometrically
extends above the airfoil surface will be a detriment, at least on the advancing blade,
where it can generate shock waves in the locally supersonic flow. To avoid this problem, Post
& Corke (2006) and Post (2004) investigated the use of surface-mounted plasma actuators for
dynamic stall control on pitching airfoils (see the sidebar Plasma Actuators). A general overview
of plasma actuators is given by Corke et al. (2010). The plasma actuator was located at the very
leading edge, where it was found to be most effective in controlling leading-edge flow separation
and extending stall on stationary airfoils. The actuator spanned the leading edge of the airfoil. It
was oriented so that when activated, it would produce a two-dimensional body force across the
span that would accelerate the boundary layer flow in the direction from the leading edge toward
the suction surface of the airfoil. In this manner, it was designed to augment the separation delay
PLASMA ACTUATORS
The term plasma actuator has now been a part of the fluid dynamics flow control vernacular for more than a
decade. A particular type of plasma actuator that has gained wide use is based on a single dielectric barrier discharge
mechanism that has desirable features for use in air over a range of static pressures. These plasma actuators most
generally consist of two electrodes, one uncoated and exposed to the air and the other encapsulated by a dielectric
material. The electrodes are typically arranged asymmetrically. The electrodes are supplied with an ac voltage that,
at high-enough levels, causes the air over the covered electrode to weakly ionize. The ionized air appears blue. For
these flow actuators, the mechanism of flow control is through a generated body force vector field that couples with
the momentum in the external flow. The body force can be derived from first principles, and the plasma actuator
effect can be easily incorporated into flow solvers so that their placement and operation can be optimized. They
have been used in a wide range of internal and external flow applications. Although initially considered to be useful
only at low speeds, they have been shown to be effective in a number of applications at high subsonic, transonic,
and supersonic Mach numbers. This has largely come from more optimized actuator designs that were developed
through better understanding and modeling of the actuator physics. For further information, readers are referred
to Corke et al. (2010).
mechanism produced by the pitching motion with α˙ > 0. Post & Corke investigated both steady
and unsteady open-loop forcing. In both cases, the actuator operated continuously throughout
the pitching cycle. In the unsteady operation, the plasma actuator was cycled on and off at a frequency,
f, that was found to be effective in controlling the separated shear layer. This utilized a
dimensionless frequency, F+ = f c /U∞ = 1, that was found to be most effective in maintaining
attached leading-edge flow on stationary airfoils (Post & Corke 2006). Assuming a convection
speed of vortices generated by the actuator pulsing of 0.5 U∞, F+ = 1, results in two vortices
spaced over the chord of the airfoil. This was verified by flow visualization (Post 2004, Post &
Corke 2006). For the pitching airfoil, the unsteady plasma actuator frequency was 20 times higher
than the pitching frequency. For conditions of deep dynamic stall, the steady actuation produced
a 4.7% improvement in the cycle-integrated lift. The unsteady actuation at F+ = 1 was slightly
better, with a 5.4% improvement in the cycle-integrated lift. Although the improvement in the
lift was small between the unsteady and steady actuation, the improvement in the pitch stability
was substantially better with the unsteady actuation.
Corke et al. (2011) proposed a method to use an unsteady plasma actuator, along with a highfrequency
response pressure sensor placed near the leading edge, to detect the onset of dynamic
stall, and thereby disrupt the development of the dynamic stall vortex. The method relied upon
the findings of Haddad et al. (2005), who showed that the receptivity of the boundary layer over
a parabolic leading edge to an unsteady disturbance grows on the order of 100 times prior to the
formation of a separation bubble. At pitch angles below the static stall angle, αss, the attached
boundary layer is not receptive to unsteady disturbances produced by a plasma actuator located
at the leading edge. As the airfoil pitch angle approaches αss, the separation bubble moves toward
the leading edge. The separation bubble is receptive to the low-amplitude unsteady disturbances
produced by the plasma actuator. These are transmitted to the pressure sensor when the separation
bubble extends from the leading-edge site of the disturbances to the pressure sensor location.
This typically occurs at an angle of attack just below αss. At this angle of attack, the unsteady
disturbances produced by the plasma actuator are easily detectable by the pressure sensor. The
unsteady disturbances remain detectable as long as the flow remains separated. However, they are
no longer detectable if the flow would naturally remain attached (Corke et al. 2011).
Based on this, Lombardi et al. (2013) devised a close-loop dynamic stall control approach that
introduced a low-amplitude periodic disturbance at F+ = 1 using a plasma actuator at the leading
edge that was operated in a low-power sense state. With this approach, the authors sought to detect
the periodic disturbance with a flush-mounted pressure sensor located on the airfoil that would
indicate the onset of leading-edge flow separation. If the disturbance was sensed, the plasma actuator
was changed to a higher-powered control state that would reattach the flow. Figure 10 shows
an example of the outcome of the closed-loop control for conditions that correspond to light dynamic
stall. Figure 10a illustrates the flow visualization and corresponding suction-side pressure
distribution at the maximum angle of attack during pitch-up, and at αmax +4◦ during pitch-down,
without and with closed-loop flow control. With the closed-loop control, the flow remains attached,
with a commensurate increase in the suction pressure peak at the leading edge. Figure 10b
shows the total effect of the closed-loop control on the lift and pitch moment coefficient cycles.
The closed-loop control logic for the determination of the onset of flow separation utilized a
threshold on the level of the periodic disturbance sensed by the pressure sensor. For the left pair
of plots, the threshold was such that the control was operating approximately 47% of the pitching
cycle, starting during pitch-up at 4.5◦ before αmax and ending during pitch-down at α = 8.0◦. This
is the same threshold condition for the flow visualization and pressure distributions in Figure 10a.
As evident by the lift and moment cycles, this resulted in a substantial reduction in the lift and
moment hysteresis. For the pair of plots on the right, the control operated over only 11.2% of

the pitching cycle starting 2.2◦ before αmax and ending just 0.1◦ past αmax during pitch-down. This
control was essentially only operating during the formation of the dynamic stall vortex. With even
that short duration, lift and moment cycles reveal the same fundamental improvement in the stall
hysteresis that occurred with the significantly longer actuator operation. Quantitatively, the cycleaveraged
lift increased by 12%, and 	cycle went from slightly negative (−0.007) to positive (0.007)
as a result of the closed-loop control. From an active flow control input energy perspective, this
targeted control provided an 88% improvement over the open-loop control by which the actuator
operated throughout the pitching cycle.
4. SUMMARY
This review highlights the rich flow physics that underlies dynamic stall on a pitching airfoil.
Although it is relevant to many manmade and natural flyers, we emphasize helicopter rotor aerodynamics
because dynamic stall ultimately limits their maneuverability and agility, as well as speed
and payload.
We place particular focus above on aerodynamic damping because of the tendency for dynamic
stall to lead to flutter, which is an aeroelastic coupling that can result in limit-cycle growth of vibration
amplitudes and eventual structural failure. The recently introduced intracycle aerodynamic
damping formulation of Bowles (2012) has provided new insight into this process that was previously
masked by the traditional cycle-averaged view. Particularly significant is the observation
that the intracycle damping can exhibit relatively large negative peaks over a wide range of Mach
numbers, even in cases with positive cycle-averaged damping. In this manner, successive rotations
of the rotor through negatively damped retreating blade regions can lead to additive limit-cycle
growth, even though the cycle-averaged damping remains positive.
The phase relation between the airfoil pitching motion and the aerodynamic pitch moment
determines the sign of the aerodynamic damping. The intracycle damping analysis makes it clear
that the initial formation and convection of the organized dynamic stall vortex prior to reaching the
maximum angle of attack are the sources of strong negative aerodynamic damping. This contrasts
with earlier interpretations (Liiva 1969) that attributed negative aerodynamic damping to the
sudden flow separation at stall and the combination of the nose-down pitch moment and α˙ < 0
at αmax. This has important implications for damping control schemes, which should properly be
focused on weakening the organized vorticity.
The dynamic stall process is highly sensitive to surface roughness that can influence turbulent
transition in the separating boundary layer and to local compressibility effects that occur at freestream
Mach numbers that are otherwise incompressible for the stationary airfoil. In lieu of shock
formation at higher Mach numbers, dynamic stall originates with a sudden eruption of vorticity
from the boundary layer near the leading edge, which leads to a strong viscous/inviscid interaction
with the outer flow. This gives rise to a well-defined dynamic stall vortex, which then convects aft
over the airfoil. It is the formation and subsequent evolution of the dynamic stall vortex that causes
massive excursions of the aerodynamic loads and pitch moment from linear thin airfoil theory.
Compressibility has been shown to alter the onset mechanism for dynamic stall, promoting
leading-edge stall through separation bubble bursting. In addition, compressibility effects generally
weaken the dynamic stall vortex strength. However, if the Mach number is high enough to
form shocks downstream of the leading edge, the dynamic stall vortex forms downstream of the
shock front, and its topology differs from that at lower Mach numbers. With such shock-induced
dynamic stall, any flow separation at the leading edge has little effect on the aerodynamic loads
and moments.
Numerous studies cited in this review have provided descriptions of the processes that characterize
both light and deep dynamic stall regimes, as well as the influence of parameters such as
airfoil geometry, reduced frequency, stall penetration angle, and Reynolds and Mach numbers.
However, a unified understanding of the physics surrounding the pitching airfoil flow field still remains
elusive. In fact, many aspects of dynamic stall inception in even incompressible flow remain
incomplete. Although compressibility effects have been well characterized, the physical mechanisms
associated with them are, in many cases, not fully understood. There remains a particular
need for better understanding regarding the physics of shock-induced dynamic stall that can occur
at higher subsonic Mach numbers.
At Mach numbers below which shocks occur, turbulent trips in the form of distributed roughness
near the leading edge are able to weaken the dynamic stall vortex and, as a result, positively
increase the aerodynamic damping. However, at higher Mach numbers associated with shockinduced
dynamic stall, the turbulent trips produced large negative intracycle damping. Because
helicopter rotor leading-edge surfaces are generally rough, this could be the source of unexpected
aeroelastic flutter on the advancing rotor. Ultimately, the sensitivity of dynamic stall to leadingedge
roughness bodes well for the possibility of dynamic stall control with minimal power input.
Above we cite several studies that have investigated dynamic stall control by both active
and passive means. Regardless of the approach, the focus is to (a) increase cycle-integrated lift,
(b) reduce impulsive blade pitching moments, and (c) assure a positive cycle-averaged aerodynamic
damping and minimize the intracycle negative damping that can occur during portions of the
pitching cycle. If the dynamic stall boundary can be extended via a suitable control scheme,
a revolutionary stall-free rotor could become a reality. However, despite the demonstrated
successes reported in marginalizing some detrimental effects of dynamic stall, few of the flow
control approaches have been demonstrated at the combination of Rec and M∞ that is applicable
to the full rotor environment. It is recommended that this be a focus of future dynamic stall flow
control studies. Of particular interest are smart active control schemes that can sense dynamic
stall onset and then exploit a shear layer receptivity mechanism in such a manner as to mitigate
the detrimental effect of dynamic stall with minimal power input. Particularly attractive are flush
surface actuator designs that can operate at high subsonic Mach numbers without giving rise to
the detrimental effects associated with shock formation.

Abstract
The leading-edge vortex (LEV) is known to produce transient high lift in
a wide variety of circumstances. The underlying physics of LEV formation,
growth, and shedding are explored for a set of canonical wing motions including
wing translation, rotation, and pitching. A review of the literature
reveals that, while there are many similarities in the LEV physics of these
motions, the resulting force histories can be dramatically different. In twodimensional
motions (translation and pitch), the LEV sheds soon after its
formation; lift drops as the LEV moves away from the wing. Wing rotation,
in contrast, incites a spanwise flow that, through Coriolis tilting, balances
the streamwise vorticity fluxes to produce an LEV that remains attached to
much of the wing and thus sustains high lift. The state of the art of vortexbased
modeling to capture both the flow field and corresponding forces of
these motions is reviewed, including closure conditions at the leading edge
and approaches for data-driven strategies.
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding and achieving high lift is a recurring theme in aerodynamics. Figure 1 gives a
smattering of airfoil data for the maximum lift coefficient achieved over a wide range of Reynolds
numbers. At the relatively high Reynolds numbers typical of manned flight, high maximum lift
coefficients are easily attained as flow remains attached through reasonably severe pressure gradients.
The maximum lift coefficient falls off quickly in transitional flows but can be recovered by
installing turbulators to ensure a turbulent boundary layer and encourage attached flow. At lower
Reynolds numbers, however, boundary layers remain laminar and are more prone to separate in
adverse pressure gradients; airfoils stall at low angles of attack and low lift values. It is in this
regime that insects fly, inviting the question of how flight is possible if, in steady flow, their wings
produce only a quarter of the lift required. In a quest to explain the fundamentals of natural flight,
biologists performed numerous studies of live insects, mounted dried wings in wind tunnels, and
built mechanical models of the insect wing stroke (Dickinson et al. 1999, Ellington et al. 1996,
Usherwood & Ellington 2002, Willmott & Ellington 1997, Willmott et al. 1997). In doing this,
they discovered a flow structure that arose from unsteady and revolving motions of the wing but
failed to appear in conventional steady flow over the same wing—the leading-edge vortex, or, its
briefer sobriquet, the LEV.
Interest in the LEV grew quickly, due in part to efforts to develop agile small-scale vehicles
and biomimetic fliers and swimmers. The engineering approach to the high lift problem has been

to distill the complex insect wing stroke into canonical motions in which the LEV is a prominent
feature of the resulting flow. The current review focuses primarily on these canonical flows, largely
because they are simple enough to allow us to establish the underlying physics of the LEV. As we
discuss in detail below, the net effect of the LEV is to induce a transient fluid dynamic load on
the wing. This has benefits (e.g., for dynamic soaring, energy harvesting, or initiating aggressive
vehicle maneuvers), but can also lead to undesirable fatigue loading and vibrations, and in some
cases, can induce unwanted vehicle motions (e.g., in a gust encounter or air wake). The timescale
over which the LEV forms and sheds is fast—only a few convective times. This is within an insect
wing stroke, thus making natural flight possible at these scales. It is, however, also very fast with
respect to our ability to effect control, whether that be locally using flow control or more globally
at the vehicle level. The future development of more maneuverable and gust-tolerant vehicles thus
depends on our ability to better understand and control leading-edge separation and the resulting
vortex-dominated flow.
The significant enhancement of lift attributable to the LEV has motivated several questions
that have guided most investigations of this topic: What parameters control the growth of the LEV
and its circulation? What mechanisms govern its eventual shedding, and importantly, under what
circumstances might it remain attached to the wing? Can the behavior of the LEV—its evolution
and the force it exerts on the wing—be predicted with a simple mathematical model? Is there
hope for the control of LEVs, either to mitigate transients in gust encounters and other unsteady
flows or to enhance high lift on maneuvering wings? The current state of the answers to these
questions is reviewed here. In the next section, some fundamentals of LEV growth and shedding
are presented. Following that, a set of canonical problems and their governing parameters are
discussed, including a review of LEV formation during these motions. We then summarize the
state of mathematical modeling of these flows and the resulting unsteady loading on the wing.
The review concludes with a brief discussion of avenues for future work.
2. FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF THE LEADING-EDGE VORTEX
Many of the general features of incipient leading-edge flow separation—the formation and evolution
of the LEV and its resulting influence on force—can be observed in the fluid’s response
to the simplest of unsteady motions on the most basic of aerodynamic surfaces: the impulsive
rectilinear translation of a two-dimensional (2D) flat plate at large angle of attack. An example
of this flow is illustrated in Figure 2, which depicts the streamlines and vorticity field
of the flow developing over a flat plate of chord c and thickness 0.023c traveling at 35◦ incidence
and Reynolds number Uc/ν = 500, where U is the plate’s speed and ν the kinematic viscosity of
the fluid. Time is measured in convective units, t∗ = tU/c, with the motion initiated at t∗ = 0.
The results in Figure 2 were obtained using high-fidelity numerical simulation with the lattice
Green’s function/immersed boundary projection method (Liska&Colonius 2017). From the start
of the motion, the thin wing profile ensures a separation point that remains nearly pinned to the
leading edge. Vorticity generated at the edge forms a shear layer that quickly rolls up into the
LEV, clearly visible at t∗ = 0.5 (see the sidebar titled Vortex Identification). At early times, the
stagnation streamline forms a closed recirculation region on the upper side of the plate that occupies
only the forwardmost fraction of the chord. As the LEV grows, it induces a region of reversed
flow and secondary vorticity along the surface of the wing under the LEV, evident as early as
t∗ = 0.5. Together with the base of the feeding shear layer, this develops into a characteristic
lambda-shaped region of counter-rotating vorticity just upstream of the LEV. As plate motion
continues, the LEV is fed by the shear layer and grows in both size and strength. The stagnation
point behind the vortex moves downstream, reaching and eventually passing the trailing edge.
Vorticity field (color contours) and streamlines (solid gray lines) from a high-fidelity numerical simulation of flow about a two-dimensional
plate undergoing impulsive translation at angle of incidence α = 35◦ and Reynolds number Re = 500. The stagnation streamline is the
thick black line. Vorticity contours range from −20U/c to 20U/c, where U is the plate speed and c is the chord length. Time is
measured in convective units, t∗ = tU/c.
After three chord-lengths of travel, the LEV shown in Figure 2 breaks away from the plate and
convects into the wake. The progression of vortex development shown here is similar for other
wing sections at other Reynolds numbers, motion profiles, and angles of attack, so long as there
is large-scale flow separation at the leading edge.
The development and motion of the LEV has a large impact on the fluid dynamic force exerted
on the wing. The histories of the lift coefficient on the plate at various angles of incidence are
shown in Figure 3. Each case follows a similar trend: After the infinite force at t∗ = 0 due to
the inertial reaction of the fluid from the impulsive start, the lift resets to a finite value due to
the release of the starting vortex at the trailing edge, consistent with the Wagner effect (Wagner
1925). The lift increases from this initial value, quickly at first and then more gradually, to a peak
near t∗ = 2 that reaches as high as CL = 2.5, after which it drops rapidly. The rise in lift is stronger
and faster, and the subsequent drop is earlier, as the angle of incidence increases toward 45◦. All
of these behaviors are attributable to the dynamics of the LEV, illustrated in Figure 3b. Here,
the pressure coefficient along the suction side of the wing is shown for the same case of α = 35◦
presented in Figure 2. Throughout the evolution of the flow, it is clear that there is a region of
low pressure directly under the LEV. This region grows in both magnitude and size as the LEV
develops (for t∗
< 2.2) and then begins to attenuate as the vortex breaks off of the wing and moves
VORTEX IDENTIFICATION
In experiments and high-fidelity simulations, the boundaries of the LEV may be defined by various techniques,
including the 1 and 2 functions (Graftieaux et al. 2001), the Q criterion ( Jeong & Hussain 1995), and Lagrangian
coherent structure analysis (Haller 2001).

away, leading to the drop in lift observed at t∗ ≈ 2.5. In the physical world, where the flow is
not constrained to remain 2D, 3D instabilities generally cause the shed vortex structures to lose
their coherence; the flow proceeds toward a fully separated state with a concomitant loss of lift
and increase of drag. In summary, the LEV enhances the lift on the wing to values significantly
above what can be achieved in a fully developed separated flow at long times, but this enhancement
survives only as long as the LEV remains near the wing.
2.1. Control Volume Analysis
The discussion of LEV growth and evolution in this review is facilitated by definition of a control
volume suitable for accounting for the various fluxes into the vortex. The control volume depicted
in Figure 4 is constructed to serve multiple forms of wing geometries and kinematics in either
two or three dimensions; its contour C encloses the LEV and much of its feeding shear layer
at some instant. However, rather than evolving dynamically with the LEV, the control volume
will remain stationary relative to the wing and allow flux through any side. For analysis of the
spanwise variation of these fluxes, the control volume has infinitesimal width dy in that direction.
Conservation of mass in this volume is expressed, per unit spanwise length, as
−

In words, any net inflow of mass through the side (C) of the control volume must be balanced by
an increase in spanwise flow. In a strictly 2D flow, which has no such spanwise outlet, the influxes
must be balanced by an equal outflow. This outflow is initially equal to the rate of spatial growth
of the LEV as it exceeds the fixed boundary C. Later, when the vortex is no longer fed by the shear
layer, the outflow is attributable to the convection of the shed LEV.
The LEV circulation—positive in the configuration depicted in Figure 4—is defined by the
total spanwise vorticity enclosed by C:

the red box. Spanwise and vertical vorticity components are denoted by ωy and ωˆ z, respectively, and vy is the spanwise velocity.
In a 2D flow, this circulation remains invariant along the span by definition, but in three dimensions,
it is important to remember that vorticity is divergence-free, with the consequence
that
−

That is, any spanwise variation of circulation necessitates the emergence of nonspanwise components
of vorticity to counter this variation, a familiar result from classical lifting-line theory with
important implications for the LEV.
To develop an evolution equation for LEV circulation, we find it useful to write the vorticity
transport equation in the reference frame of the wing—which, to serve the discussion later in this
review, may be rotating with angular velocity —in a form that will emphasize fluxes:
∂ωˆ
∂t
+ ∇ · (vωˆ ) = ∇ · (ωˆ v) + ν∇2ωˆ , 4.
where ωˆ = ω + 2 is the vorticity in an inertial reference frame and ω and v are the vorticity
and velocity observed in the frame corotating with the wing, respectively. The Coriolis term is
contained within the first term on the right-hand side, which also accounts for stretching and
tilting of the vorticity ω. Integrating the spanwise component of this equation over the control
volume and then applying the divergence theorem, we obtain an equation for (y, t):

This equation is similar to one used by Wojcik & Buchholz (2014b), but by using the fact that
vorticity is divergence-free, the form used here clarifies the effect of stretching and tilting on the
LEV circulation. In particular, the terms associated with net spanwise convective flux through
S(y) and the stretching of the spanwise vorticity in this direction exactly cancel each other and are
thus absent from this equation. Additionally, the variation in viscous flux in the spanwise direction
is likely negligible and has thus been omitted. The first two terms on the right-hand side describe
the convective and diffusive flux through the boundary C of the control volume, respectively, and
the third term describes the tilting of nonspanwise components of vorticity toward the direction
of the spanwise flow on C. In a strictly 2D flow, only the first two terms are nonzero. Furthermore,
the diffusive flux is only prominent along the part of C adjacent to the wing surface, denoted with
magenta arrows in Figure 4a, where it is likely small compared to the vorticity carried in via
the shear layer. Equation 5, together with the constraints given in Equations 1 and 3, provide a
framework in which to analyze LEV growth and stability; in particular, stability requires that the
right-hand side of Equation 5 is approximately zero.
2.2. Growth and Shedding in Two Dimensions
The early development of the LEV is characterized by monotonic growth in both its size, characterized
by a length, D(t), and its strength, quantified by its circulation, (t). As the control volume
analysis of the previous section shows, the rate at which the LEV grows spatially in a strictly 2D
setting is determined by the influx of mass from the shear layer at the leading edge and from the
flow induced between the vortex and the wing, as illustrated in Figure 4a. The first of these is
a function of the shear layer’s thickness and is thus entirely attributable to viscosity. The second
form of influx, in contrast, represents an entrainment of mass into the vortex core and is present
even if the vortex develops in a purely inviscid context, where the shear layer reduces to a spiraling
vortex sheet (Kaden 1931, Pullin & Wang 2004). Although this entrainment in a viscous flow
is somewhat mitigated by the induced boundary layer, it still represents the dominant path for
mass influx (Huang & Green 2015). As indicated by Equation 5, the growth of LEV circulation
is primarily determined by the convective fluxes of vorticity into the LEV. The vorticity in the
shear layer is the primary contributor to this growth, whereas the ingestion of secondary vorticity
in the boundary layer under the vortex—sometimes called “annihilation” (Wojcik & Buchholz
2014b)—tends to slow the growth.
The overall development of the LEV is a complex interplay of viscous and inviscid effects.
At early times, the vortex development is independent of the chord length and, with no imposed
length scale, is therefore necessarily self-similar. Xu & Nitsche (2014) have found that, for an
infinitely thin flat plate moving at normal incidence across a wide range of Reynolds numbers
(larger than 250), the circulation and centroid position of the vortex emerging from either edge
are well predicted at early times by the inviscid solution—the self-similar roll-up of a vortex sheet
from a semi-infinite plate (Pullin 1978). This inviscid solution is an extension of the classical result
by Kaden (1931) and leads to the conclusions that /(Uc) ∼ t∗1/3 and D/c ∼ t∗2/3. To adapt these
results to the LEV, the proportionality constant in these relations must depend on the angle of
incidence (Pullin & Wang 2004).
As the observations suggest, the dependence of LEV development on viscosity is second order
and difficult to succinctly describe in scaling arguments. Furthermore, in the latter stages of its
evolution, various influences appear to be in conflict with each other: At lower Reynolds number,
the shear layer will be thicker, increasing the flux of mass that this shear layer carries into the
LEV, but simultaneously, the induced flow ingested into the vortex will be relatively weaker.
Finally, with viscous influence comes a dependence on the geometry of the leading edge, since the
shape of this edge—most simply measured by a characteristic dimension, LLE—will determine the
thickness of the feeding shear layer. Since LEV development remains essentially independent of
chord length until late in the process, the viscous influence on vortex properties must be through
a leading-edge Reynolds number, ReLE = ULLE/ν. Through differences in this parameter, two
With a finite length of chord, the LEV cannot continue to grow indefinitely. Inevitably, the
supply of circulation from the shear layer is severed, the vortex becomes a topologically distinct
structure, and it is shed into the wake of the wing. This chord-limiting mechanism for shedding,
sometimes called “bluff-body shedding” (Rival et al. 2014, Widmann & Tropea 2015) is intuitive
and is clearly triggered when the extent of the vortex approaches that of the chord, D/c ≈ 1. It
is identifiable by the bursting of the closed recirculation region, as seen in the results depicted
in Figure 2. As the example in Figure 3 shows, this process is reflected in a dramatic change
in lift. Widmann & Tropea (2015) have postulated a second form of vortex shedding called
“boundary layer eruption”: The ingestion of secondary vorticity accumulates into the lambdashaped
structure and eventually chokes the feed of vorticity from the shear layer. The appearance
of this mechanism, which is independent of chord length, would necessarily depend on ReLE.
A typical vortex shedding event is likely to be a mixture of these mechanisms. Huang & Green
(2015) have illuminated the kinematics of the vortex shedding process on a pitching flat-plate wing
with Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS) analysis. They showed that the LCS saddle point at the
top of the lambda-shaped structure remains nearly stationary as long as the LEV continues to be
fed by the shear layer. This saddle, however, splits into two at the first break in the feeding shear
layer, and the subsequent motion of the first saddle point can be used to unambiguously identify
the instant at which the LEV sheds from the wing. More subtle changes in the vortex dynamics
(e.g., intermittent vorticity transfer from the shear layer) are indicated by the emergence and
rapid motion of additional saddle points. This process appears to be consistent with the boundary
layer eruption mechanism described by Widmann & Tropea (2015), but shedding occurs nearly
simultaneously with the reattachment point reaching the trailing edge.
3. KINEMATIC FAMILIES AND PARAMETERS
While biological flight has motivated some of the recent study of LEVs, the flows generated by
flapping wings cannot be easily disentangled to isolate the underlying LEV physics. As a result,
many investigators interested in these physics have decomposed flapping, as well as other complex
kinematics in which the LEV is a culprit, into a set of more basic wing motions illustrated in
Figure 5: translation, rotation, and pitch. It is important to stress that the use of the term “decompose”
does not suggest an underlying superposition principle; it is abundantly clear that no
such principle can exist in these large-amplitude motions with highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.
Rather, this decomposition provides a foundation on which further studies of combinations of
these canonical motions can build. In similar fashion, the geometry of the wing, though assuming
widely disparate forms across nature and technology, has generally been studied in a simple
symmetric form: a rigid, rectangular planform, with the profile of a flat plate or a thin NACA
(National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) section. Of course, even basic motions can take
many forms if left to the whims of individual research groups. The canonical motions and geometries
established in recent years by two consortia of researchers—NATO AVT-202 (North
Atlantic Treaty Organization Applied Vehicle Technology) and the AIAA (American Institute
of Aeronautics and Astronautics) Massively Separated Flows Discussion Group (Ol & Babinsky
2016, Ol et al. 2010)—have aligned many of the LEV-focused investigations and are the target of
much of this review.
Wing translation, illustrated in subpanel iii of Figure 5a, is defined as motion in which the
wing is set at a fixed incidence and either driven in purely rectilinear motion at velocity U(t) or
subjected to a freestream flow with this velocity. (Note that the forces generated by these two

different configurations will differ by an effective buoyant force, ρU˙ V, where V is the volume of
the wing.) The most basic form of U(t) is an impulsive start from rest to constant velocity, U.
A more practical form is obtained by a linear ramp to this constant velocity over some specified
distance, giving rise to the kinematics depicted in Figure 5b. Since this motion requires a sudden
change of acceleration at its start and finish, several recent studies have made use of a smoothed
(continuously differentiable) version of the ramp given by Eldredge et al. (2009). Each smooth
change in behavior from constant value to linear ramp is generated by the function
Ga (t) = 1

which approaches 0 as t → −∞and is approximately t as t → ∞. The parameter a controls
the degree of smoothing: Its inverse represents the blending time between behaviors. A smooth
increase in velocity from 0 to U between times t1 and t2, for example, is generated by
U

[Ga (t − t1) − Ga (t − t2)] . 7.
In any case, U serves as the characteristic velocity, Uref , of the problem and, together with chord
length, c, leads to the dimensionless expression of time in convective units, t∗ = tU/c. Since this
definition equivalently expresses the distance traveled by the wing in units of chord lengths, it is
easily generalized for accelerating wings (Chen et al. 2010) to

In pure translation of a wing of rectangular planform with span b, in a fluid of density ρ and
dynamic viscosity μ, the flow is characterized by only three dimensionless parameters: the angle
of incidence, α; the aspect ratio, AR = b/c; and the Reynolds number, Re = Uc/ν. It should
be noted that applications involving unsteady leading-edge separation are generally at low Mach
number, so the flow can be considered incompressible. The resulting forces on the wing are
nondimensionalized to form lift and drag coefficients, CL and CD, with the usual inertial scaling,
ρU2bc/2.
In wing rotation, illustrated in subpanel iv of Figure 5a, the wing adopts a fixed angle of
incidence, α, and rotates in a propeller-like motion. The axis of rotation passes through a point
that is either at or inboard of the wing root; the distance from the axis to the root is called the root
cutout, rc. Like translation, wing rotation may start impulsively, although it is usually initiated
with a linear ramp, often smoothed with Equation 6, toward a constant angular velocity, .
The rotating wing problem is nondimensionalized by some combination of the collection of
parameters , c, b, rc, α, and ν. However, in the interest of constructing a physically relevant
scale for convective and inertial effects, and perhaps facilitating a meaningful comparison with the
translating wing, a characteristic velocityUref must be formed from among these. Because the local
incident velocity varies linearly from the axis of rotation, every possibility for the characteristic
scale, Uref = R, requires a selection of some spanwise location R; the definitions for Reynolds
number, Re = Rc/ν, and force coefficients [e.g., CL = 2L/(ρ2R2bc )] follow. Within the
literature, various choices of R have been made, including midspan; three-quarter span; radius of
gyration, rg; and wing tip, rc+b, so that a comparison between any two rotating wing studies must
first reconcile their definitions of parameters.
In addition to Re and α, there are two ratios of length, b/c (i.e., the aspect ratio, AR) and rc/c,
that potentially influence the fluid dynamics of a rotating rectangular wing. These length ratios can
be varied independently, and it is useful to note that the translating wing represents the extreme
where rc/c → ∞. However, collectively, these two parameters have a physical role in assessing
the ratio of inertial force, ρU2
ref/c, to Coriolis effects, ρUref , measured by the Rossby number,
Ro = Uref/(c ). In fact, as the present review shows, the flow generated by a rotating wing is more
sensitive to this ratio than it is to the ratio of inertial to viscous effects (i.e., Reynolds number).
The definition of Ro requires the same arbitrary choice of reference location R, so that multiple
definitions of Rossby number have appeared in the literature, e.g., Ro = (rc + b)/c (Lentink &
Dickinson 2009) and Ro = rg/c (Wolfinger & Rockwell 2014). The first definition quantifies the
local inertia at the wing tip, while the second represents a spanwise-average influence. In cases
where rc = 0, the first definition is equivalent to the wing aspect ratio, AR, and the second differs
only by a constant factor. However, for wings with root cutout, the difference between these
definitions is more significant, and AR remains an independent parameter (Schlueter et al. 2014).
For either definition, a translating wing of finite aspect ratio represents the limit Ro→∞(with
the constraint that the product U = rc is kept finite in this limit). Thus, rotating wings with root
cutout fall on a spectrum of 1/Ro between translating and rotating, as depicted in Figure 5a.
Wing pitch, depicted in subpanel i of Figure 5a, is defined as a motion in which the wing
undergoes a steady increase in angle of incidence, α(t), from zero to some larger fixed value well
beyond its static stall angle. As in the other cases, most recent studies have used Equation 6 to
smooth the change in angle of incidence and avoid the infinite inertial forces due to impulsive
accelerations at the start and finish of this maneuver. For a wing of chord length c translating at
constant speedU and pitching at nominal rate α˙ 0, themotion is characterized by three parameters:
the Reynolds number, generally defined in the same manner as for pure translation motion; the
reduced pitch rate, K = α˙ 0c/(2U), which is generally explored in the range between 0.01 and 1;
and the pivot axis position, Xp/c, which typically lies between 0 (pivot about the leading edge) and
1 (pivot about the trailing edge).
The combination of rotation and pitch, illustrated in subpanel ii of Figure 5a, is less commonly
explored in the literature and is only briefly reviewed here. Furthermore, the flows generated by
other commonly studied kinematics, particularly those comprising oscillatory pitch (Lind&Jones
2016, Mulleners&Raffel 2012, Ohmi et al. 1991), surge (Granlund et al. 2014, 2016), or transverse
(Calderon et al. 2013b, Panah et al. 2015, Visbal 2011) motions; or canonical (Baik et al. 2012,
Choi et al. 2015, Fenercioglu&Cetiner 2012, Ol et al. 2009, Rival&Tropea 2010) or bio-inspired
(Bomphrey et al. 2009, Hubel & Tropea 2010, Jardin et al. 2012, Krishna et al. 2018, Ozen &
Rockwell 2010, Phillips et al. 2015) combinations of these often contain important LEV dynamics
but are omitted from this review for brevity.
4. THE PHYSICS OF LEADING-EDGE VORTICES
4.1. Rectilinear Translation
Arguably the simplest of the canonical kinematics is rectilinear translation, and this is the case
that was used to present the basic features of the LEV in Section 2. The flow topology, force
histories, and surface pressure distributions resulting from a 2D version of this motion are given
in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. From the start of the motion, the force produced by a wing
rapidly accelerated in translation grows as the LEV forms and falls off when the LEV sheds. The
mechanism of shedding may vary, but the LEV typically sheds within the first few chord lengths
of travel, and lift augmentation ceases at this point.
The fluid dynamic forces on the wing are intimately linked to the strength and position of the
LEV. Logically, varying the wing velocity will vary the rate at which vorticity is generated, and
thus the rate at which the LEV gathers circulation, and so will affect the LEV strength, shedding,
and force history of the wing. Faster wing motions (i.e., greater accelerations) have been found to
generate more vorticity and a tighter, more coherent LEV; slower accelerations produce weaker
vortices and lower forces (Chen et al. 2010, Mancini et al. 2015). Once the LEV moves off of
the wing, however, it follows a very similar trajectory for both cases (Manar et al. 2016, Mancini
et al. 2015). Despite this, the effect of the startup transient persists in the force history for many
convective times; in experiments, the fully developed wake and constant force is not established
until t∗
> 14 (Mancini et al. 2015).
In addition to effects from the LEV, force history is a direct function of acceleration due to
added mass, discussed further in Section 5 (Mancini et al. 2015, Pitt Ford&Babinsky 2013, Pullin
& Wang 2004). By removing the added mass component of the measured force, it can be shown
that the remaining circulatory force (i.e., that due to the LEV) is less sensitive to acceleration,
especially for t∗ ≤ 0.5 (Chen et al. 2010, Mancini et al. 2015). At this early stage, the trailingedge
vortex is still forming and all of the circulation in the flow is contained in the LEVs and
trailing-edge vortices (Pitt Ford & Babinsky 2013). Even for 1 ≤ t∗ ≤ 1.5, after the vortices shed,
the circulation within them is nearly equal and opposite. Bound circulation on the wing remains
small; the total lift force can be attributed to a combination of added mass and the LEV rather
than attached flow (Pitt Ford & Babinsky 2014, Pullin & Wang 2004).
On finite wings, tip vortex development affects both the formation and shedding of the LEV.
The severity of 3D effects decreases at higher aspect ratios, but all finite wings are susceptible to
LEV bending (resulting in arch vortices), stall cells, and wake instabilities. Numerical simulations
and flow visualization experiments have demonstrated that the flow topology remains the same at
early times for AR = 1, 2, and 4. From the start of the impulsive wing motion, flow separates at
the leading edge, trailing edge, and wing tips, forming a closed-loop vortex system, as shown in
Figure 6 (Taira & Colonius 2009, Freymuth et al. 1987). Past the initial transient, however, the
wake behind the wing becomes more dependent on aspect ratio as the tip vortices gain strength.
On a wing of aspect ratio 1, the tip vortices grow to affect the entire wing span and the vortex sheet
emanating from the leading edge remains attached to the wing. At higher aspect ratios, however,

the tip vortices are less dominant. At long times, the leading-edge shear layer separates from an
AR = 2 wing and forms an arch-shaped vortex that is not visible on an AR = 1 wing (Kim &
Gharib 2010, Taira & Colonius 2009).
Despite interactions, the LEVs and tip vortices remain distinct structures on rectangular wing
planforms; the sharp corners of the planform suppress vortex stability by impeding spanwise flow
and vorticity convection between the structures (Kim & Gharib 2010, Taira & Colonius 2009).
LEV shedding can be delayed on translating wings with rounder planforms that allow for vorticity
convection into the tip vortices, but vorticity transport in these 2D kinematics is not sufficient to
allow the LEV to remain attached for long times (Mancini et al. 2015, Taira & Colonius 2009).
4.2. Rotational Motion
The LEV on a rotating wing begins to form in a manner very similar to that of the translating
wing. Here, however, the spanwise velocity gradient that results from rotational motion produces
a spatially varying rate of vorticity generation, and thus the LEV that forms is conical, increasing
in both strength and size with radial distance from the axis of rotation. These radial increases
of the LEV are clearly visible in both the computations of Garmann & Visbal (2014), shown in
Figure 7, and in the plot of experimentally measured LEV circulation shown in Figure 8. As the

wing accelerates through ψ = 30◦ (Figure 8b), both LEV circulation and lift increase rapidly.
Past this point, the wing continues to rotate at a constant velocity and the LEV continues to grow,
albeit more slowly. In the example of Figure 8, lift reaches a global maximum near ψ = 120◦,
which in this case corresponds to the point at which the outboard portion of the LEV has grown
to cover the entire wing chord (see Figure 9b). The LEV remains attached to the wing and
of a similar size and strength as the wing completes a full rotation, resulting in near-constant
lift.

Due to the fundamental difference in LEV structure, the sustained lift values achieved on a
rotating wing are significantly greater than those on a translating wing (Lentink & Dickinson
2009, Manar et al. 2016, Usherwood 2008, Usherwood & Ellington 2002). The strength of the
LEV is highly (nearly linearly) dependent on angle of attack (Ozen & Rockwell 2012, Wojcik &
Buchholz 2014a), but neither velocity profile nor Reynolds number has a significant effect on the
nondimensional LEV strength (DeVoria & Ringuette 2012, Ozen & Rockwell 2012, Wojcik &
Buchholz 2014a) or the forces on the wing (Usherwood 2008). Measurements of the circulation of
the LEV on the rotating wing at a given spanwise location exceed the bound circulation predicted
by thin airfoil theory at that local velocity (Wojcik & Buchholz 2014a) but agree well with the
measured forces ( Jones & Babinsky 2010), supporting claims that lift on the wing is primarily
a result of the LEV and not bound circulation (Hemati et al. 2014; Pitt Ford & Babinsky 2013,
2014). Further evidence for this is given in Figure 7,where pressure contours are plotted under the
LEV, revealing a clear low-pressure region under this structure with higher pressure elsewhere.
The attached LEV is unique to the rotating wing case. Early hypotheses as to the source of
LEV stability focused on the convection of vorticity via spanwise flow (Ellington et al. 1996) but
were confounded by reports that blocking this flow did not result in vortex shedding (Birch &
Dickinson 2001). Later work demonstrated that, while spanwise flow absent rotational motion can
allow the LEV to remain attached for short times, it is insufficient for the attached LEV observed
on rotating wings at long times (Beem et al. 2011, Jardin & David 2014). On a rotating wing,
spanwise flow from root to tip, vy > 0, is generated by virtue of the linear variation of incident
flow along the span. It is typically of the same order of magnitude as the wing tip speed (Carr et al.
2013, Garmann & Visbal 2014, Harbig et al. 2013, Medina & Jones 2016, Wolfinger & Rockwell
2014) and is enhanced on the underside of the vortex core by the Coriolis term, which induces
an outboard-oriented “force” on any fluid element moving relatively slower than the incident
flow (Garmann & Visbal 2014, Jardin 2017). Although some have described this spanwise flow
as a mechanism for vorticity transport, there is no explicit representation of it in Equation 5; its
effect is canceled by spanwise vortex stretching. The third term of that equation does, however,
represent tilting of the nonspanwise components of vorticity toward the spanwise direction. This
tilting includes the influence usually described as the Coriolis effect ( Jardin 2017, Lentink &
Dickinson 2009). In canonical rotating motion of a wing at angular velocity  and angle of attack
α, for which z = cosα > 0, vorticity is generated in the fluid adjacent to the wing of strength
ωˆ z ≈ 2z > 0 (or ωz ≈ 0 in the corotating frame). On the underside of the control volume, where
the spanwise flowis strongest andwhere n·ωˆ ≈ −ωˆ z < 0, this flowtilts this component of vorticity
into a negative spanwise component, opposite that of the LEV. This process, which might be more
appropriately called Coriolis tilting, is illustrated schematically in Figure 4c. In addition to Coriolis
tilting, vorticity annihilation can be a significant contributor to the outflux of circulation (Medina&
Jones 2016, Wojcik&Buchholz 2014b). By careful accounting of the vorticity within the flow, as in
the control volume analysis of Section 2.1, researchers have shown that LEV stability—equivalent
to relatively little growth in LEV circulation and persistent attachment to the wing—must be
achieved through a balance of vorticity transport mechanisms including convection, stretching,
Coriolis tilting, and annihilation ( Jardin 2017, Wojcik & Buchholz 2014b). These mechanisms,
however, vary along the span in different manners, so vorticity equilibrium is only achievable along
some fraction of the wing. In fact, Jardin (2017) found that by artificially modifying the magnitude
of the Coriolis term and thus the Rossby number of the flow, the spanwise extent of this stability
can be altered.
At the point along the wingspan where the balance of vorticity becomes untenable, the LEV
bursts. Burst typically occurs near or beyond the midspan but moves inboard with increases in
Rossby number (Carr et al. 2013, Garmann & Visbal 2014, Harbig et al. 2013, Kolluru Venkata
& Jones 2013). It is visible near the midspan in the bottom row of Figure 7 and in Figure 9b. The
bottom row of Figure 9c provides measurements of the spanwise flow near the burst point of the
example from Figure 8. Spanwise flow at the k−1 plane is from the wing root to the wing tip but
reverses direction at k, and a region of tip-to-root flow is visible at k+1. The top row in Figure 9c
gives the vorticity field at each of the planes, where the process of negative vorticity entrainment
and LEV expansion is visible. During this process, the vortex line representing the core of the
LEV tilts aftward, the outboard portion of the vortex moves off of the leading edge, and the LEV
lifts off of the wing in a manner not dissimilar from that of the translating wing; measurements
beyond midspan at relatively high Re do not detect an attached LEV ( Jones & Babinsky 2010).
4.3. Translational Pitching
The LEV development on a wing that pitches while in translation is distinct from the previous
two motions and is governed primarily by the reduced pitch rate, K, the location of the axis of
rotation, Xp/c, and the wing’s aspect ratio, AR. Before discussing the physics of the flow’s response
to the pitching maneuver, it is useful to take note of the parameters that, to leading order, are
essentially unimportant in the flow response. As observed with other maneuvers, the Reynolds
number does not have a significant role; studies conducted over the range from O(102) to O(105)
share a common behavior (Ol et al. 2010). Furthermore, the response is not particularly affected by
the wing’s cross-sectional geometry. Most of the studies of the late 1980s were carried out with a
NACA 0015 section, generally pitched about its quarter chord, whereas many of the investigations
of the past decade focused on a flat plate of 2% thickness. Aside from differences in the angles at
which the milestone events occur, the studies in these respective cohorts reveal the same essential
physical processes and the same trends in the parameters.
LEV formation during the pitch-up maneuver, illuminated by experimental flow visualization
(Granlund et al. 2013, Shih et al. 1992, Stevens & Babinsky 2016, Walker & Chou 1987,
Yilmaz & Rockwell 2012), numerical simulation (Eldredge et al. 2009, Jantzen et al. 2014, Visbal
2017, Visbal & Shang 1989), and measurements of surface pressure (Acharya & Metwally 1992,
Strickland & Graham 1987, Visbal & Shang 1989) and shear stress (Schreck et al. 2002) follows a
characteristic sequence of events. At low angles, a separation point appears near the trailing edge,
and a recirculation region develops downstream of this point; as angle increases, the separation
point moves toward the leading edge. After this point reaches the leading edge, the flow departs
substantially from the quasi-steady behavior observed if the wing were held at any of these angles.
A closed separation bubble emerges near the leading edge, inside of which the thickening
boundary layer rolls up into the LEV. Subsequent behavior is similar to that observed in the other
maneuvers.
As pitch rate K increases, all of the same components of this process are observable, but vary in
two critical respects. First, and perhaps most obvious, is that the LEV is increasingly stronger due
to the faster flow speeds and larger pressure gradients brought about by more rapid rotation. The
second aspect, less obvious, is that many of the milestones—the formation of the recirculation
zone, the initiation of the LEV, and its eventual shedding—are increasingly delayed to larger
angles of incidence (Buchner et al. 2012, Granlund et al. 2013, Jumper et al. 1987, Schreck et al.
2002, Strickland & Graham 1987, Visbal & Shang 1989, Walker & Chou 1987).
These delays are also evident as the pitch axis is moved aftward (Visbal & Shang 1989, Yu &
Bernal 2016). It is not surprising that increases in K and Xp/c exhibit similar influences on the
delay. The wall-normal component of velocity at the leading edge, relative to that of the incident
flow, is U

sin α − 2KXp/c

; hence, increases in either parameter tend to reduce this component.
However, it is impossible to conflate their influences based solely on this argument, as increases

Reynolds number 1,000. Vorticity contours (in all cases, between ±30U/c) are depicted on the left for reduced pitch rate K = 1, 0.6,
and 0.2 (from top to bottom) when the plate is instantaneously at 30◦ incidence, corresponding to the circles on the respective lift
curves. (b) Lift coefficient versus instantaneous angle of incidence for K = 1 (top) and K = 0.2 (bottom), decomposed into the added

in Xp/c do not intensify the LEV strength as K does. Visbal & Shang (1989) found that the
peak suction exerted by the LEV, a reasonable measure of its strength, increases steadily with K
but decreases with increasing Xp/c. The initial formation of the LEV cannot be predicted by a
kinematic parameter such as K or Xp/c. However, the leading-edge suction of the wing, which
measures the instantaneous state of the flow at the wing’s nose, appears to reach a critical value
across a variety of motions (Ramesh et al. 2014). This will be discussed further in Section 5.3.
The force generated by a pitching wing has several notable features that distinguish this maneuver
from those at fixed angle. Because the wing is simultaneously pitching and translating
throughout the maneuver, the force exerted on the wing is a mix of the influence from the vortices
developing at the edges and from the inertial reaction of the fluid (i.e., added mass). Examples of
this force are shown in Figure 10a, which depicts the histories of the lift generated at various pitch
rates, obtained from high-fidelity simulation of a flat plate pitched upward about its leading edge
to 45◦ at Reynolds number 1,000 (Eldredge & Wang 2010). Both the lift and time are displayed in
their conventional scalings with the translational velocity. Figure 10b shows the lift at two pitch
rates, K = 0.2 and 1, now plotted versus the instantaneous angle of incidence of the plate; in these
panels, the lift is decomposed into the added mass and circulatory contributions.
Each pitch-up begins with a smooth acceleration from α = 0◦ over a fixed time interval that
starts just before t∗ = 1 and finishes soon afterward; the short-lived peak centered at this instant
is due to the added mass from acceleration, as Figure 10b confirms. Since the final angle is
achieved earlier at higher pitch rate, the duration of the history is compressed as K increases.
This also explains why the added mass peak appears relatively wider at larger K in the plots versus
angle of incidence. The most significant feature of the lift response to this increase in K is its
dramatic increase in peak magnitude, from approximately 3 at K = 0.1 to nearly 16 at K = 1.
Though some of this increase in magnitude is attributable to added mass (proportional to K, as
Equation 11 confirms below), this part is relatively weak, as Figure 10b shows. Thus, most of the
lift enhancement is due to the circulatory part of the force, overcoming the negative lift due to the
decelerating rotation at the end of the maneuver. At angles below static stall, this circulatory lift
exceeds its quasi-steady value at all pitch rates larger than approximately 0.02 (Yu & Bernal 2016).
The excess lift is due to the rates of circulation accumulation in the trailing-edge vortex and the
LEV, which both increase with K; the increased strength of the LEV is apparent in the vorticity
depicted in Figure 10. Several researchers (Eldredge et al. 2009, Granlund et al. 2013, Strickland
& Graham 1987) have attempted to develop mathematical expressions for the lift coefficient that
account for pitch rate and pivot axis location, but these have been only moderately successful due
to the flow memory encoded in the vortex dynamics. Recent models for the force, discussed in
Section 5, have had more success by explicitly including these dynamics.
4.4. Comparisons and Combinations of the Canonical Motions
There are many similarities in LEV physics between the three canonical motions described above,
but there are also some key differences. Both of the inherently2Dkinematics (translation and pitch)
shed their LEV within a few chord-lengths of travel. They produce high lift at early times before
the LEV sheds, but lift drops off rapidly as the vortex moves off of the wing. The pitching wing
in particular produces extremely high lift due to a combination of the inertial reaction of the fluid
and the presence of the LEV. On a rotating wing, however, the spanwise flow that develops is
strong enough to contribute to LEV stability and so the fully developed flow is fundamentally
different—the LEV remains of a near-constant strength and in a near-constant position on the
wing.
Figure 11 gives a comparison of results from a number of research groups that have performed
experiments on rectangular flat-plate wings undergoing the four canonical motions given
in Figure 5. Note that in Figure 11, the x-axis is the convective time based on the constant
final velocity of the wing, U, so while acceleration (in translation, rotation, or pitch) is performed
over one chord-length of travel for all motions, the end of the unsteady portion of the maneuver
appears on the axis at t∗ = 1 for the pitching cases, where U is constant, and at t∗ = 2 for the
translating and rotating cases, where U varies with t. Note also that the lift coefficient given here
is the measured lift coefficient, which includes not only the direct effect of the LEV but also
any inertial effects that arise due to unsteady wing motion. Direct comparison of these results
highlights the similarities between the force curves of the translation and rotation cases and the
marked difference that is effected by adding the pitch-up motion in either case. Dynamic pitch
dramatically increases the buildup and magnitude of the lift transient during the unsteady part of
the maneuver; fixed-incidence translation and rotation result in much slower lift growth with less
overshoot. The primary difference between the lift histories of a pitching wing in rotational or
rectilinear motion is that the forces relax to a steady state much more quickly in rotation than in
translation.
In the results shown in Figure 11, the lift coefficient at long times approaches similar values
for both translational and rotational wing motions (except for the AR = 2 translating wing,
where the difference can be attributed to aspect ratio effects). However, several other studies
have reported that, due to the attached LEV, a rotating wing in fully developed flow produces
greater lift than does a translating one (Manar et al. 2016, Percin & van Oudheusden 2015). This

as well as the force
apparent contradiction is attributable to the choice of lift normalization. Recall from Section 3
that the computation of CL on a rotating wing requires an arbitrary choice of reference velocity,
affecting the magnitude of the nondimensional lift force. The necessity of this arbitrary choice
highlights the need for flow models that capture the underlying physics of the LEV rather than
blindly producing force predictions.
5. LOW-ORDER MATHEMATICAL MODELING
There has been significant effort over the past few decades to distill the transient physics of leadingedge
flow separation into simple dynamical models. The objectives of this modeling effort are
multifold. First and foremost, one generally seeks a fundamental understanding of the process
of LEV evolution. Furthermore, by capturing the essential physics of the flow in a mathematical
model and, particularly, the response of the flow to various forms of external input (e.g., actuation,
gust encounter, or motion or deformation of the wing or control surface), we can better conceive
of ways to manage the flow to some desired end.
Modeling strategies for leading-edge separation can be categorized in different ways. One
categorization is based on whether the strategy leads to a force model or a flow model. Aflow model
should have far fewer degrees of freedom than, say, a fully resolved Navier–Stokes simulation,
since it is meant to be a distillation of the physics into some simplified form. Members of either
category can be roughly grouped into two approaches: models that build from first principles,
generally using vortex models from inviscid flow theory, and models that are reductions of the
full equations of motion. An example of this latter form is the work of Brunton et al. (2013),
in which they linearized the Navier–Stokes equations about a stable equilibrium at low angle of
incidence and then used the eigensystem realization algorithm to obtain a reduced-order model.
The model was then used to successfully predict the lift response to a modest 10◦ pitch-up/pitchdown
maneuver. Although such model-reduction approaches are a rich area of research, they are
generally limited in their ability to capture the full range of behaviors of the LEV because they are
based on linearization about some state or on a decomposition into modes that are only optimal
for a particular motion. Vortex element models, in contrast, are naturally adaptive to the changing
flow conditions and embody the essential nonlinearities of the flow through mutual interactions
between elements. The current review primarily focuses on these models and particularly their
most recent incarnations, in which they are informed by empirical data.
5.1. Computing the Force
A key to the success of unsteady aerodynamics models is to isolate the part of the force due to
inertial reaction of the fluid, i.e., the added mass terms, so that the model is dedicated to computing
the remaining circulatory force. Ultimately, a fluid exerts its influence on the wing through surface
traction: pressure and viscous stress. However, its influence can also be accounted for by the rate
of change of momentum—or, more specifically, the impulse—in the fluid. The great advantage
of the impulse perspective is that, whereas the surface pressure depends nonlinearly on the fluid
velocity field, the impulse depends on it linearly and can thus be decomposed into parts from
fluid vorticity, wing motion, and uniform flow. The vorticity, or circulatory, portion includes the
direct influence of the fluid vorticity, as well as an indirect influence from the wing due to the
no-penetration condition, that is, the impulse of the bound vorticity, which in a viscous setting is
the vorticity in the boundary layer. The parts of impulse resulting from the wing motion relative
to the fluid—the noncirculatory components—comprise the inertial reaction of the fluid and
give rise to the added mass. For example, for a 2D flat plate of length c and infinitesimal thickness,
the added mass component that gives rise to linear momentum due to translation normal to the
plate is ρπc2/4.
The focus in this section is on the application of an inviscid vortex model to flow about a flat
plate in which fluid vorticity is represented by discrete vortex elements, as depicted in Figure 12.
Suppose that the plate, instantaneously at angle α(t), is rotating at angular velocity α˙ about a
pivot point while translating at velocity (−U, ˙h ) relative to the ground frame. The pivot point is a
distance a = c/2−Xp forward of the plate centroid. The plate is surrounded by a set of Nv vortex
elements with positions xJ and strengths J = Jez, for J = 1, . . . ,Nv, each of which advects with
velocity uJ. Any point x in ground coordinates can also be expressed in plate coordinates, ˜x = ( ˜ x, ˜y),
via x = XC + ˜ xτ + ˜yn, where n = (sin α, cos α) is the plate’s normal vector, τ = (cos α,−sin α) is
its tangent vector, and XC is the position of the plate’s centroid. The velocity of this centroid, U,
has tangent and normal components
Uτ = −U cos α − ˙h sin α, 9.
Un = −U sin α + ˙h cos α − aα˙ . 10.
It can be shown, e.g., via conformal mapping from a unit circle (Milne-Thomson 1996), that the
rate of change of impulse leads to an expression for force on the plate–vortex system given by
f = −ρ

the moment can be shown to have an analogous expression. The leading two terms comprise the
inertial reaction (i.e., the effect of added mass) and depend only on the plate kinematics, including
Figure 12

denoted by (x, y) and the plate coordinates by (˜ x, ˜ y). The plate translates with velocity (−U, ˙h) (relative to

The plate’s centroid and angle of incidence are instantaneously XC and α, respectively. The J-th vortex

All of the remaining terms are circulatory forces. The third term in Equation 11 constitutes the
direct effect of all fluid vortex elements on force via their motions and changes in circulation. In
steady flow at low angle of incidence, this term accounts for the classical Kutta–Joukowsky lift
through the advection of the starting vortex: The vortex moves away from the plate at the velocity
of the incident flow on the wing, −U, and its constant strength, 1, is equal and opposite to the
bound circulation on the plate, 0, so we have f = −ρU × 0.
The remaining circulatory contributions to force in Equation 11 are contained in the final term,
fv. It was noted above that the impulse of a vortex contains both its direct contribution as well
as the indirect contribution from its associated bound vorticity (most easily imagined as the effect
of the vortex’s potential flow image inside the plate); fv contains this indirect influence from
each vortex. This force is significant only when the centers of vorticity are near the edges of the
plate, where the bound vorticity has its greatest influence; it vanishes as these centers move away
from the edges. Rather than provide a complete derivation of this force here, the reader is referred
to Li & Wu (2016). For the purposes of developing intuition, it is reasonable to assume that
fv is zero, so that the circulatory force is well approximated by the third term in Equation 11.
It remains to describe the means of entry and subsequent evolution of vortex elements in the
fluid.
5.2. Vortex Modeling of the Separated Flow
For more than a century, inviscid flow theory has been our most effective language for describing
the aerodynamics of the attached flow past a wing, furnishing us with results that remain unsurpassed
in their brevity and reliability. Much of this success is attributable to the minimal incursion
of viscosity on the problem. In attached flows, the boundary layer remains thin and on the surface
of the wing, and thus it can be suitably ignored in favor of a bound vortex sheet. In those parts
of the problem where viscosity’s role is physically essential—in setting the flux of vorticity into
the wake—this role can be robustly replaced by a constraint, the Kutta condition, that prohibits
infinitely large velocities at the trailing edge of the wing.
A flow that separates before reaching the trailing edge poses obvious challenges to this strictly
inviscid description. The separated flow, instead of passing immediately into the wake, now has
many opportunities to interact again with the boundary layer of the wing, and even the point
(or line) of separation may be in question and determined by subtle viscous mechanisms. But for
flows that separate near the leading edge, as are the focus of this review, the mechanics remain
mostly inviscid, and we propose that these flows can also be described with models that are drawn
from the potential flow toolbox: advecting vortex elements that induce velocity upon each other
and are subject to the no-penetration condition of the wing. However, it should be recognized
that, in contrast to the trailing edge, where the vorticity flux is set by the Kutta condition that the
velocity remain finite, the condition at the leading edge is ambiguous. Indeed, the model might
be more effective if it is left slightly underdetermined in this respect, so that it can be augmented
by empirical measurements; this is discussed in the next two sections.
In previous work, researchers seeking to model the lift on supersonic delta wing aircraft
used inviscid flow theory to predict the influence of the LEV (Brown & Michael 1954,
Edwards 1954, Mangler & Smith 1959, Polhamus 1966), extending classical thin airfoil theory
with some representation of the separated flow. The models differ only in the manner in which
the LEV is represented: an analytical model of a spiral vortex sheet (Mangler & Smith 1959)
or a single, variable-strength point vortex representing the rolled-up core (Brown & Michael
1954, Edwards 1954). Vortex models of separating flows in agile flight or rotorcraft, notably
those developed by Sarpkaya (1975) and Katz (1981), increasingly relied on emerging computational
resources to provide greater fidelity than earlier analytical models. These 2D models
represent the separating flow and wake with discrete point vortices released in short time increments
from the respective edges of the wing. More recent models developed by Ansari et al.
(2006), Xia & Mohseni (2013), and Ramesh et al. (2014) have utilized similar approaches, although
with different leading-edge conditions, as discussed below. Vortex sheet models, such
as those by Jones (2003) and Shukla & Eldredge (2007), maintain connectivity between shed
vortex elements, enabling greater authority over the initiation of instabilities and their associated
length scales. Unfortunately, both the vortex sheet model and the discrete vortex element
model become progressively more expensive as time proceeds and the number of elements grows.
Furthermore, as the LEV convects along a wing at modest angle of incidence, these models
exhibit nonphysical behaviors in lieu of the essentially viscous interactions with the boundary
layer.
To avoid these issues, Wang&Eldredge (2013) took a simple approach similar to that of Brown
& Michael (1954) and used a single, variable-strength vortex element at each edge to capture the
formation and convection of the edge’s associated flow structure. Variable-strength vortices require
special care, however, because they necessarily produce a discontinuous pressure along a
curve between the vortex and the wing. Brown & Michael (1954) addressed this by modifying
the advection velocity of the vortex so that its altered force cancels the spurious force generated
by the pressure discontinuity. The velocity modification is proportional to the rate of transfer of
circulation, ˙ , from the wing to the vortex. Unfortunately, the Brown–Michael approach makes
it impossible to avoid a clumsy jump in force whenever the strength of a vortex is frozen. To
avoid this nonphysical result, Wang & Eldredge (2013) calculated the modified velocity to ensure
that the force on the wing is independent of ˙ through an approach they called “impulse
matching.”
As computational resources have become cheaper and more widely available, it has become
correspondingly faster to achieve high-fidelity simulations of dynamically separated flows. Vortex
models no longer have a clearly advantageous role as predictive tools. However, because of their
unique aptitude for capturing inherently nonlinear flow dynamics (vortex–vortex and vortex–body
interactions) even with a minimal number of elements, vortex models remain powerful for distilling
the full flow physics into a computationally tractable form.
5.3. Leading-Edge Conditions, Vorticity Flux, and the Suction Parameter
Classically, a mathematical model of wing aerodynamics based on 2D inviscid flow theory includes
three basic ingredients: a transport equation for the vortex elements in the fluid, such as those
discussed in the previous section; the Kutta condition, which ensures finite velocity and pressure
at the trailing edge; and Kelvin’s circulation theorem, a constraint that requires that any change
of circulation in the wake is balanced by an equal and opposite change to the bound circulation.
Traditionally, the Kutta condition is enforced—at every instant in an unsteady flow—by choosing
the bound circulation. Kelvin’s theorem, in turn, determines the strength of newly shed wake
vorticity. At low angles of incidence, the circumstances at the leading edge can be ignored, aside
from noting that the flow there will generally have large velocity and (suction) pressure. These
become infinite as the nose radius approaches zero, but the integrated pressure remains finite in
the limit and is called the leading-edge suction.
The three basic ingredients can be generalized to model a flow with expected leading-edge
separation. However, some condition must now be placed on the flow at the leading edge to
determine the strengths of vortex elements that enter the fluid at that point. A reasonable approach
is to express the rate at which circulation enters the LEV, which follows directly from the convective
flux of vorticity via the shear layer, as shown in Equation 5. This can alternatively be written in
terms of the speed of the flow, vLE, just outside the shear layer at the leading edge of the wing:
d
dt
= −1
2 v2
LE. 13.
Some researchers (e.g., Katz 1981, Sarpkaya 1975) have used this equation to determine the
strength δ of new vortex elements entering the flow near the leading edge in each time step.
However, it is considerably challenging to accurately calculate vLE in the vicinity of a discrete
set of singular vortex elements and a singular leading edge, and since the growth of the LEV
circulation depends strongly on this velocity, small errors can lead to significant miscalculations
of the growth.
For a suitable alternative, it is helpful to revisit the concept of edge suction. Enforcement of
the Kutta condition at an edge is equivalent to prescribing its suction force to be zero; thus, this
condition can be expressed as
σ(δ; S(t)) = 0, 14.
in which the strength δ of a nascent vortex element is determined by this condition on the scalar
function σ, which is called the edge’s suction parameter (Ramesh et al. 2014). In addition to δ, this
parameter depends on the current state, S(t), of the flow: the positions and strengths of all existing
vortex elements, as well as the current configuration and motion of the wing. The σ parameter has
two essential properties. First, it has units of velocity, and the edge’s suction force (per unit length)
is equal to ρσ2c/2. Second, the sign of σ describes the direction in which the flow is traveling
around the edge. In other words, σ is a measure of the average velocity circumnavigating the edge;
when the Kutta condition is enforced at that edge, this average is zero.
Both the leading and trailing edges of an infinitesimally thin representation of a wing have an
associated edge suction parameter, and each provides an opportunity for generalizing the constraint
imposed at that edge. It is usually sufficient to leave the suction parameter at the trailing
edge fixed at zero, as in classical aerodynamics. At the leading edge, however, it is reasonable
to relax this condition on its suction parameter, σL. Ramesh et al. (2014), for example, postulated
that the flow around the nose of a wing can tolerate some amount of suction—and the
associated adverse pressure gradient—without separating. Since σL is defined so that it is generally
positive, they proposed that no vorticity be released as long as σL is smaller than a critical
value, σL
max:
σL(δ; S(t)) ≤ σL
max. 15.
If, instead, the instantaneous σL exceeds the allowable range, then a new vortex element is released
from the edge, with a strength δ proportional to σL − σL
max to ensure that σL is brought back
within bounds. Clearly, the Kutta condition is equivalent to setting σL
max to zero, and Equation 15
can be viewed as a generalization of this condition. The Kutta condition leads to a prediction of
circulation growth that is too strong except at very large angles of incidence (Wang & Eldredge
2013). Larger values of σL
max naturally lead to the release of weaker vortex elements from the leading
edge, and there is necessarily a maximum value of σL
max that σL never exceeds and that reverts the
model to shedding from the trailing edge only. It is important to stress that, for any nonzero value
of σL
max, the leading edge of a thin airfoil will have singular flow velocity and nonzero leading-edge
suction.
To determine the appropriate value of σL
max, Ramesh et al. (2014) postulated that, for a given
airfoil section and Reynolds number regime, there is a unique value of σL
max (when nondimensionalized
by a characteristic velocity)that holds across a wide variety of airfoil kinematics. They
obtained this value by carrying out both a high-fidelity simulation and a vortex model of some
representative motion, noting the value of σL in the vortex model at the instant when the highfidelity
simulation first exhibits the formation of a vortex at the leading edge. Vortex models of
other canonical motions, using this same σL
max, agreed reasonably well with high-fidelity results.
Although there is evidence from the study of Ramesh et al. (2014) that σL
max is insensitive
to the motion of the wing, there is also an advantage in assuming that σL
max adapts to changing
conditions. For example, a time-varying value of σL
max can serve as a trigger for the transient
aerodynamic response to an incident disturbance or actuation (Darakananda et al. 2018). In fact,
as is discussed further in Section 5.4, σL
max provides a natural opportunity for constructing a datadriven
vortex model that is responsive to empirical measurements: Rather than prescribing the
value of σL
max from offline calibration, its time-varying value might be obtained through data
assimilation.
5.4. Data-Driven Models
Because of the ambiguity in succinctly describing the physics of leading-edge flow separation
in a mathematical model, many investigators have proposed semiempirical approaches in which
measurements are used to inform some phenomenological model of the flow. The underlying
model, termed a dynamical template model in this review, captures much of the underlying physics
but leaves one or more parameters unspecified and to be determined from measurements. These
approaches represent a form of system identification, familiar in the field of control theory. Such
a procedure might be carried out as a postprocessing of data from experiments or high-fidelity
computations in order to obtain a simple closed-form description of the flow and force behavior,
or, by restricting the measurements to those obtained from onboard sensors and employing tools
from data assimilation, it might serve as a framework for real-time dynamic estimation of the
current flow state.
Inviscid vortex models that are informed from empirical data represent a useful and intuitive
approach to distilling the flow field. For example, Pitt Ford & Babinsky (2013) constructed a
basic potential flow template of a 2D flat plate accelerating from rest but left the positions and
strengths of a general set of point vortices unspecified. Each of these parameters was determined
by applying vortex identification tools to experimental flow data. This allowed them to deduce
aspects of the flow field unavailable from the direct measurements, such as the value of bound
circulation.
The approach taken by Pitt Ford&Babinsky (2013) omits the vortex dynamics (i.e., the motion
of point vortices with the local velocity field) from the template model, leaving the instantaneous
vortex position to be determined empirically along with its strength. Alternatively, the model
could include these dynamics and rely on measurements only to determine the strengths of vortex
elements. The aforementioned study of Ramesh et al. (2014) represents a particularly light touch:
Empirical measurements—from high-fidelity simulation—were used to determine a single static
parameter, σL
max, that helped determine the element strengths while the underlying dynamical
model was otherwise unmodified. Other approaches are more heavily reliant on data. For example,
Hemati et al. (2014) used the variable-strength vortex model of Wang & Eldredge (2013) as
a dynamical template but did not specify constraints at the edges of the wing. Instead, the rates of
change of the two vortex element strengths (i.e., the growth rates of theLEVand trailing-edge vortex
circulation) were found by minimizing a cost function—the error between the model-predicted
force and the “true” force obtained from high-fidelity computation over a time window—subject
to the constraint that the vortices obey their usual dynamics about the wing. This approach successfully
matched empirical force data for multiple cases of wings in pure translation and pitching,
except at low angles of incidence, where the drag was primarily due to skin friction and therefore
impossible to model with vortex dynamics. The constrained minimization approach taken by
Hemati et al. (2014) requires a full empirical measurement history; an a posteriori phenomenological
model is iteratively constructed from these historical data. Darakananda et al. (2016) improved
the efficiency of the technique by building the data-optimized model progressively in short time
increments. The vortex growth rates in each increment are first predicted from a regression over
their recent history; these are then refined by minimizing as before, using the new force data in the
increment.
The investigations of Hemati et al. (2014) and Darakananda et al. (2016) demonstrated that
force measurements can provide meaningful information about the unknown rates of vorticity flux
into theLEVand the wake. However, one drawback was that the underlying model of two variablestrength
vortex elements was too simple to capture the mechanics of shedding. Furthermore, the
strategy they used is not of practical value if the objective of the model is to predict force, as is
typically the case. It is helpful to employ tools from the field of data assimilation, such as the
Kalman filter (KF), to develop a truly predictive strategy that is assisted by practical—and likely,
noisy—sensor measurements. The basic premise of the KF is to advance the estimate of a system’s
state in two steps within each time increment. The state of the flow is first predicted with a
dynamical model, and then this prediction is updated by incorporating new measurements. The
ensemble KF (EnKF) is a variant of the KF designed for dealing with high-dimensional nonlinear
systems, such as fluid flows (Evensen 2009). In the framework of an EnKF, Darakananda et al.
(2018) employed a discrete vortex element model with the leading-edge suction criterion for the
predictive step and used surface pressure measurements obtained from a high-fidelity Navier–
Stokes simulation (the “truth” system) for the update. The state vector comprised the positions
and strengths of the vortex elements and, crucially, σL
max. This framework was used to estimate the

flow past a translating flat-plate wing at α = 20◦ and Re = 500. As the results in Figure 13 show,
the estimated vorticity field and normal force agreed well with the truth; the small noise in the
force estimate is due to the fact that the EnKF uses an ensemble of random instances of the model.
As Figure 13b shows, the estimate of σL
max settled to a reasonably constant value, supporting the
hypothesis of Ramesh et al. (2014).
SUMMARY POINTS
1. The leading-edge vortex (LEV) is an essential flow feature of agile flight in nature and
small-scale vehicles. Its mechanics can be understood by distilling complex wing geometries
and kinematics into basic canonical forms.
2. The early development of the LEV and its structure are remarkably common across a
wide variety of wing kinematics and geometries, in both two and three dimensions, and
are relatively independent of Reynolds numbers from O(102) to O(104).
3. The lift generated by the LEV is significantly larger than achievable in steady, attached
flow, but this enhancement is short lived except on rotating wings.
4. The LEV inevitably sheds from the wing in nearly all kinematics and geometries, except
over limited spanwise ranges in rotating wings, where Coriolis tilting and vorticity
annihilation collectively balance the growth of LEV circulation.
5. Vortex models can capture the inherent nonlinearities of the LEV flow field with a
modest number of degrees of freedom. Their accuracy can be systematically improved
by data assimilation using sensor measurements.
FUTURE ISSUES
1. The canonical motions of rigid wings described in this review set only a foundation of
understanding; ultimately, these motions will be combined and applied to flexible wings to
form agile maneuvers. These higher-order combinations and the resulting fluid–structure
interactions will require systematic study, possibly with help from machine learning to
navigate the large parametric space toward optimal maneuvers.
2. LEVformation or response in incident gusts and other transient disturbances has only recently
received systematic attention. We have little understanding of how LEV behavior
will change in an uncertain environment.
3. Data-driven vortex modeling of theLEVhas the potential to provide real-time estimation
of the flow state in a closed-loop control setting. Furthermore, 3D vortex models have
been largely unexplored but have the potential to capture the essential influences of the
tip vortices and spanwise flow on low–aspect ratio wings.
4. Closed-loop control of massively separated flows, effected with pulsed actuators or variations
in wing geometry, remains a primary objective for achieving agile flight vehicles
that remain robust to incident gusts. The LEV is likely to play a central role in this
control.

The inuence of edge undulation on vortex
formation for low-aspect-ratio propulsors
Experiments to study the effect of edge undulation on vortex formation have been
conducted on impulsively accelerated plates. Abstractions of propulsors found in
nature are produced by imprinting undulatory features with varying wavelengths
onto the circumferential vortex-forming edge of circular plates. The effects of the
small-scale disturbances introduced by these modifications are accessed by means of
force measurements and time-resolved particle image velocimetry. Investigations of
four different geometries at two different Reynolds numbers reveal an insensitivity
of the flow towards length scales smaller than or similar to the thickness of the
feeding shear layer. However, the instabilities in the shear layer and the coherence of
the vortex wake are influenced when the wavelength of the undulation exceeds the
shear-layer thickness by a significant margin. This results in a force augmentation due
to enhanced entrainment into the turbulent vortex core, and thus an associated faster
vortex growth rate. Yet, contrary to prior expectations, the time of vortex pinch-off
remains constant for all edge modifications. The causeâ€“effect relationship behind the
stability of the vortex wake is further investigated. While for small edge undulations
a turbulent transition of the vortex core results in vortex pinch-off, for larger edge
undulations the turbulent vortex core is found to be fed constantly with additional
circulation from the shear layer.

1. Introduction
Thy dynamics of swimming and flying differ significantly between the observable
behaviour in nature and engineering solutions. Flow separation in quasi-steady
flows (e.g. on fixed wings and rigid bodies) usually leads to significant losses of
propulsive efficiency and control authority, and hence is generally avoided in most
engineering applications. In contrast, during a propulsive stroke in nature, animals
utilise accelerating and morphing propulsors to actively trigger flow separation, as
sketched in figure 1. At the vortex-forming edge (VFE; marked green in figure 1),
a shear layer separates from the propulsor. Subsequently, the shear layer rolls up

Lauder (2006)).
to form a vortical structure. Fluidâ€“structure interaction between the vortex and the
propulsor leads to the production of lift and thrust, while maintaining manoeuvrability.
Comprehensive overviews of animal locomotion are given by Azuma (2006), Shyy
et al. (2007) and Biewener & Patek (2018) to name but a few.
According to Pitt Ford & Babinsky (2013), the importance of the unsteady vortex
to lift and thrust is defined by its circulation, as the vortex contains most of the
circulation bound to the propulsor. However, when the vortex sheds, the associated
forces are reduced significantly. As a consequence, the influencing factors on the
circulation of the vortex wake and its stability have been widely addressed in
recent studies. Examples include the role of rotational accelerations (see e.g. Lentink
& Dickinson 2009), propulsor flexibility (see e.g. Vanella et al. 2009), spanwise
curvature (see e.g. Taira & Colonius (2009), Hartloper & Rival (2013)), swept wings
(see e.g. Wong & Rival (2015)) and the interaction of the vortex with secondary
boundary layers (Eslam Panah, Akkala & Buchholz 2015; Akkala & Buchholz 2017).
This study aims to extend the above studies towards a characterisation of the
effects of small-scale structures in unsteady flows, and their relevance towards the
resulting vortex dynamics. In particular, we strive to draw insight into the influence
of turbulence and associated coherent flow structures of different length scales on
the vortex formation process. Inspired by undulated modifications on the VFE of
multiple propulsors in nature (see figure 1), this problem is tackled with a combined
study of vortex formation over a wide range of Re superimposed with various VFE
modifications. While an increase of Re is known to extend the range of turbulent
substructures towards additional smaller vortices, VFE modifications allow for the
introduction of disturbances with distinct wavelengths , which are predetermined by
the propulsor itself.
1.1. Background on the Re scaling of vortex formation and shear layers
Various swimmers and flyers across diverse species utilise separated flows during
their locomotion. Inspired by this evolutionary convergence, prior studies applied
dimensional analysis to extract commonalities in shape and kinematics for a large
variety of propulsors. These common shapes and kinematics developed independently
and from different lineages. For instance, Chin & Lentink (2016), among others,
characterised leading-edge vortices (LEVs) through dimensionless quantities such as
Rossby number (Ro), Strouhal number (St) and Reynolds number (Re). In particular,
Ro, i.e. the relation between centripetal and Coriolis forcing due to rotational
accelerations of the wing, was emphasised as crucial for long-term LEV stability.
Furthermore, Lentink & Dickinson (2009) revealed a limit to values of Ro < 4 in
nature across diverse species.
Plunging and pitching kinematics are characterised by the reduced frequency (k)
and the Strouhal number. Again, a narrow band of values 0:2 6 St 6 0:4 tends to
deliver maximum efficiency and can be found for both flyers (Taylor, Nudds &
Thomas 2003) and swimmers (Triantafyllou, Triantafyllou & Gopalkrishnan 1991). In
contrast, propulsors ranging from fruit flies to large cetaceans use vortical structures
for efficient propagation, which according to Gazzola, Argentina & Mahadevan
(2014) corresponds to a rather large Reynolds-number range of 102 6 Re 6 108. The
convergence over a wide range of Re found in nature suggests a small influence of the
small-scale structures in the flow onto the vortex formation process and the associated
loadings. The above result that small scales do not influence vortex formation is
unexpected since various studies indicate a Re-dependent formation of separated shear
layers. The review on quasi-steady shear layers by Ho & Huerre (1984) indicates
an essentially inviscid mechanism behind the dominant instability mechanism in free
shear layers: Kelvinâ€“Helmholtz instability (KHI). However, small-scale mixing and
entrainment are still dominated by viscous effects, as discussed by Wolf et al. (2013)
and Chauhan, Philip & Marusic (2014). Furthermore, Rosi & Rival (2018) extended
this observation for accelerating shear layers and showed that for acceleration the
spacing of KHIs varies strongly with Re.
By conducting experiments over a wide range of Re, the present study attempts to
address the paradox that, on the one hand, the Re influence based on dimensional
analysis seems to be small, yet, on the other hand, the entrainment in free shear
layers is influenced by the small structures and thus Re. Particular focus lies on the
interaction of the Re scaling with the aforementioned VFE modifications.
1.2. Background on vortex-forming edge modification
For quasi-steady flows, applications of passive flow control by means of geometrical
modifications are well established, as already outlined by Carmichael (1981). For
instance, Lissaman (1983) demonstrated significant delay of flow separation on
stalling airfoils by means of tripping strips, fixed at the respective leading edges.
Similarly, vortex generators and bio-inspired serrations have been applied for airfoil
flow control by Lin (2002) and Ito (2009), respectively. Furthermore, lobe mixers have
been proven by McCormick & Bennett (1994) to reduce the noise through mixing in
the wake of jet engines. These examples underline the importance of the nonlinear
impact of convective effects, where the introduction of small-scale structures leads to
a significant change in behaviour of the global system.
In the category of separated flows, Usherwood & Ellington (2002), Rival et al.
(2014) and Leknys et al. (2018) investigated the influence of mild VFE modifications
for accelerating propulsors. Motivated by the reports of Hertel (1966) on the
dragonfly-wing leading edge, Usherwood & Ellington (2002) imprinted a spanwise
saw-like structure on the VFE under consideration. This study â€“ most likely due
to the choice of a single wavelength â€“ did not reveal notable influences of VFE
modifications on the flow and the measured forces. Rival et al. (2014) and Leknys
et al. (2018) focused on small changes of the leading-edge curvature and reported
small yet measurable delays on vortex formation.
The high impact of nonlinear effects onto quasi-steady flows and the already
measurable influence of VFE modifications in the case of small VFE modifications
suggest that there is merit in further investigation of a wider range of introduced
disturbances in separated flows. This is supported by the observation of significant
VFE modifications on propulsors in nature. The list of examples â€“ even though from
strongly differing lineages â€“ includes webbed frog feet (e.g. Johansson & Lauder
2004), the hind limbs of sea lions (e.g. Sawyer et al. 2016) and the tubercles on the
flippers of humpback whales (e.g. Fish & Lauder 2006); see also figure 1. Note that
each of those VFE modifications is of distinct wavelength , all significantly smaller
than the length scale L of the propulsor itself.
1.3. Objectives and procedure
The combined effects of VFE modification and Re scaling are investigated on the
reference case of an impulsively accelerated, rigid circular plate of diameter D.
This canonical flow for vortex formation was recently characterised by Fernando &
Rival (2016b) and combines several features, qualifying it as a suitable base case
for this study. First, the lack of leading-edge sweep, no rotational accelerations
of the propulsor and the absence of wing-tip or wing-body effects minimises
three-dimensional effects during vortex formation. Thus, the influence of small scales
in the flow can be observed without being superimposed by complex, global and
three-dimensional flow features. Second, Fernando & Rival (2016a) showed that, in
contrast to non-circular propulsors, the circular case produces a stable vortex, which
only pinches off after multiple diameters D travelled. The stable vortex allows a
longer observation time and provides the possibility to investigate the effects of VFE
modifications onto vortex stability. The bio-inspired VFE modifications are abstracted
from the undulatory examples mentioned in Â§ 1.1 and modelled by adding a cosine
function of different wavelengths  with amplitude a D =4 onto the circular edge
geometry; see Â§ 2.1 for more parameter details.
Early on during the onset of vortex formation, a thin layer of vorticity is produced
along the VFE on the varying plates, as indicated in figure 2(aâ€“c). While the
frontal area remains constant for all plates, the effective perimeters vary due to the
superimposed waves. Therefore, it is expected that the magnitude and orientation of
vorticity generated on the edge should vary between the different geometries. During
the subsequent vortex formation, the shear layer detaches, rolls up and forms a vortex.
For the circular plate, the vortex evolution is well known (see figure 2d). The KHIs
appear during the plateâ€™s acceleration and are continuously produced during the whole
vortex formation process, as has been shown by Wong et al. (2017) and Rosi & Rival
(2017). A high-vorticity core remains stable until azimuthal instabilities appear and
destabilise the system. The wavelength of the azimuthal instabilities and their onset
in a circular vortex ring depend on Re, which has been shown by Maxworthy (1977)
for vortices produced by a classical pistonâ€“cylinder vortex generator. Fernando &
Rival (2016b) confirmed the existence of the azimuthal instability for vortex rings in
the wake of an accelerated circular plate.
For the geometries with VFE modifications, however, the formation of the vortex
wake is yet unknown. Various wakes seem possible, all of which are outlined in
figure 2. It is hypothesised that the relation
BD=2 (1.1)
of the undulatory VFE modification height =2 to shear-layer thickness  is a crucial
relative quantity. Therefore, the flow around the plates is colour-coded accordingly
in figure 2, where red indicates flow around a smooth circular plate, and green
FIGURE 2. Summary sketches of possible flow topologies around various plate geometries;

and (dâ€“i) different possible vortex formation topologies for varying Re and plate
geometries.
corresponds to VFE wavelengths in the order of magnitude of the shear-layer thickness
or smaller (B61). The flow around plates with VFE modifications with significantly
larger wavelengths is visualised in blue (B1). Three flow topologies seem possible
for small  (B 6 1). As a trivial solution, the effects of the VFE modifications
might be irrelevant or directly damped out such that the vortex formation would then
appear similar as for the unmodified circular plate (see figure 2e). The disturbances
introduced by the undulated VFE could also promote transition to a turbulent shear
layer, where the presence of turbulent small-scale structures directly corrupts the
forming KHIs (see figure 2g). Recent reports by Buchner, Honnery & Soria (2017)
suggest that a change of the dominant instability mechanism towards centrifugal
instabilities (CIs) is also possible. Small-scale VFE modifications could favour the
formation of CIs, as indicated in figure 2(h). The shear layer of larger undulatory
VFE modifications  (B1) might reorient towards a circle and roll up as discussed
for the smaller perturbations (similar to figure 2e). In contrast, a complete disruption
of the vortex formation process and an expedited transition to the fully separated
and turbulent state also seems possible (see figure 2f ). However, a mixture between
these above cases is most likely: a destabilised shear layer that rolls up to a complex
turbulent flow with a diffuse vortex core, as sketched in figure 2(i).

disturbance amplitude a and mean plate diameter D. (b) Geometries with number of
undulations np D1, np D12, np D50 and np D200.
As a consequence of the above-outlined variety of possible flow conditions and
hypotheses, the objective of the present work centres around which VFE modifications
influence the unsteady vortex wake behind accelerating propulsors. A systematic
variation of  across a wide range of Re is performed by means of time-resolved
particle image velocimetry (PIV) and force measurements in an optical towing tank.
The resulting data serve as a basis to study the instability mechanisms as they
occur with varying wavelength  and/or Re. In particular, the footprint of the VFE
modifications in the vortex formation is evaluated with respect to the resulting loading
on the propulsor and the stability of the vortex wake itself.
2. Methods
2.1. Kinematics and parameter space
The kinematics and the Re space are chosen to match the previous study by Fernando
& Rival (2016b). The plates of mean diameter D are impulsively accelerated
perpendicular to their orientation to a terminal velocity of U1 within a distance
of s D s=D D 0:5, where s is the physical distance travelled. Two terminal velocities
U1 are compared, which correspond to Re D U1D= D 50 000 and Re D 350 000
based on constant values for plate diameter D and kinematic viscosity of water .
Three plates with undulatory VFE modifications of varying wavelengths  are
compared to a smooth circular plate (np D 1). The mean perimeter pD is divided
into np waves of length  D pD=np. To avoid the introduction of additional (and
confusing) length scales into the system, the wavelength  and amplitude a of the
introduced undulations are held constant at a ratio of a= D 1=4. Consequently, the
radius of the modified plates is defined as
R.'/DD=2C=4 cos.np'/; (2.1)
which is indicated in figure 3(a). The frontal surface area A of all plates is held
constant, which is achieved by iteratively adjusting D. Note that the addition of
the cosine function in combination with a constant frontal area A implies different
perimeters P for plates of different wavenumbers kp D 1= D np=pD. In particular,
the influence of the number of undulations, np D 12, np D 50 and np D 200, is tested.

Additionally, the experiments for a circular plate (np D 1) from Fernando & Rival
(2016b) are repeated for reference and comparison. All plate geometries considered
are shown in figure 3(b); the geometrical details are also listed in table 1. The
plate with np D 50 leads to a length scale 2a similar to the spacing of KHIs and
the shear-layer thickness  (B  1). Accordingly, undulatory VFE modifications with
larger or smaller wavelengths (np D 200 and np D 12) introduce structures that are
smaller (B<1) or larger (B>1) than the shear-layer thickness, respectively.
2.2. Experimental set-up
The experiments were conducted in the 15 m long optical towing tank facility at
Queenâ€™s University, as shown in figure 4(a). The cross-section spans 1 m  1 m
and is optically accessible from three sides. An overhead traverse is used to
tow models, where an additional non-transparent semi-enclosed ceiling minimises
free-surface effects. In the present study, the four plates considered were mounted
onto a cylindrical sting with a diameter of 0:08D and length 2D, which was further
connected to the traverse by a symmetric profile of thickness 0:08D. A six-component,
submersible ATI Nano force transducer was applied between the sting and the plates
to record force data at 1000 Hz with a static resolution of 0:125 N (see figure 4b).
Every parameter combination was repeated 20 times for s 6 33 and the data were
ensemble-averaged accordingly.
Complementary to the force measurements, the flow fields in the wake of all plates
were captured by means of time-resolved planar PIV, as shown in figure 4(b). A 2 mm

thick light sheet was created through a 40 mJ pulseô€€€1 Photonics high-speed laser, and
then introduced into the tank through the bottom window. The light sheet was centred
parallel to the sidewalls in the tank and was tilted towards the towing direction to
avoid shadows in the wake.
Three multi-camera PIV campaigns were performed in a lab-fixed frame of
reference, as illustrated in figure 5 and listed in table 2. Raw images were recorded
at 200 frames per second (f.p.s.) for Re D 50 000 and 1400 f.p.s. for Re D 350 000.
Note that for plate 12 (np D12) the PIV measurements were performed twice per Re,
where the light sheet was either aligned with the maximum or with the minimum of
the plate radius (r D 169:3 mm, r D 129:3 mm). These two measurements are from
here on referred to as 12top and 12bot. Similar to the force measurements, 20 runs
of PIV data collection were performed for each set of parameters throughout all
campaigns.
Three cameras were used during the first measurement campaign to cover a
combined field of view (FOV) of s D 0â€“2:3 on the bottom half of the plate (see
figure 5). The early acceleration stage was captured in a small FOV (I in figure 5) of
0:7D  0:7D with a Photron Fastcam Mini WX100 (2048  2048 pixels, camera A)
to ensure sufficient spatial resolution near the VFE. Two additional Photron SA4
cameras (10241024 pixels, cameras B and C) captured the further evolution of the
vortex, where larger FOVs of 0:85D  0:85D (II and III in figure 5) were chosen to
account for the vortex growth. All cameras were equipped with AF-S Micro-Nikkor
60 mm 1:2.8G ED lenses, which resulted in a resolution of 9:8 pixel mmô€€€1 (FOV I)
and 4 pixel mmô€€€1 (FOVs II and III).
Owing to frame rate limitations, camera A (Mini WX100) was only used for the
lower-Re cases. The evaluation of the first campaign (i.e. the force measurements),
however, provided evidence to investigate later vortex formation stages â€“ particularly
for the high-Re case. This insight will be elaborated in more detail in Â§ 3. Therefore,
two additional PIV campaigns were performed for the circular and the np D 12 plate
and the higher Re (ReD350 000). The two Photron SA4 cameras (cameras B and C)
were readjusted to allow for an even larger FOV of 1:0D  1:0D and were used to
measure the vortex evolution from s D2:3â€“4:2 (campaign 2 â€“ FOVs IV and V) and
s D4:2â€“6:1 (campaign 3 â€“ FOVs VI and VII). The frame rates were kept identical to
campaign 1, but, owing to the larger FOV, the resolution decreased to 3:4 pixel mmô€€€1.
The raw images were pre-processed in MATLAB in terms of ensemble-based
median subtraction, edge detection and plate tracking, and masking of the shadowed
area. DaVis 8.4 was used to calibrate and process the data of each camera separately.
A multi-grid scheme with a final interrogation area of 32  32 pixels and 75%
overlap was chosen for FOVs IIâ€“VII. FOV I was evaluated with an interrogation
area of 48  48 pixels and 75% overlap. The resulting velocity fields of all 20 runs
were ensemble-averaged for each FOV. Finally, all FOVs were merged on a common
plate-fixed grid. Note that the interplay of accurate calibration, edge tracking and
good reproducibility of the flow even allows stitching of the separate campaigns to a
single FOV.
2.3. Analysis methods
To further analyse the ensemble-averaged and merged velocity fields, various
post-processing strategies are applied, each of which is outlined in this section
and indicated in figure 6.
Hunt, Wray & Moin (1988) introduced the second invariant Q of the velocity
gradient tensor as a robust means to locate vortical structures. Its maximum Qmax is
frequently applied to localise the core of such structures. More recently, Graftieaux,
Michard & Grosjean (2001) proposed two criteria (ô€€€1 and ô€€€2) to identify the core
and boundaries of vortical structures, respectively. Huang & Green (2015) showed
that ô€€€ max
1 and Qmax lead to similar core locations in cases where the reference frame
for ô€€€1 was chosen appropriately, as indicated in figure 6(a) for a plate-fixed frame
of reference. However, the location rc.t/; zc.t/ of the vortex core is estimated based
on the Galilean invariant Qmax throughout the present work to avoid any possible
uncertainties resulting from reference-frame issues.
The Galilean invariant ô€€€2-criterion is chosen to identify the boundaries of vortical
structures for ô€€€2 D 2=p. The core locations rc.t/; zc.t/ are enclosed by one such
boundary (see black line in figure 6a), which is referred to as vortex core area Aô€€€2 .
The equivalent diameter d and corresponding circulation ô€€€c of the vortex core are
determined by
FIGURE 6. Sample processing for case 12top, s D3:5. (a) Overview of applied methods:

(b) Velocity vectors and vorticity contours of the .x0; y0/ domain (red box). (c) Spatially
averaged profiles of velocity huy0 iy0 and vorticity h!'0 iy0 . Black lines in panels (b) and (c)
indicate the domain for the calculation of circulation flux ô€€€Psl.
An estimate of total vortex circulation ô€€€ including the shear layer is derived from
the integration of vorticity across a large control volume behind the plate, which is
highlighted orange in figure 6(a). The lower boundary of the control volume is fixed at
r=DD0:19 to exclude the secondary vortex from the circulation budget. The secondary
vortex occurs during the later stages of the flow and near the centre of the plate;
see Â§ 3.
Recent reports on vortex formation evaluated the convective fluxes through a cut
perpendicular to the propulsor and directly behind the flow separation to estimate the
circulation flux ô€€€Psl from the shear layer into the vortex; see for instance Eslam Panah
et al. (2015) or Akkala & Buchholz (2017). The present work attempts to advance
beyond this plate-oriented approach to overcome two shortcomings. First, the optical
access to the shear layer is blocked in the immediate vicinity of the VFE for 12bot,
since the plate is an obstruction in front of the light sheet due to radius changes; see
(2.1). The velocity information in this region, therefore, remains unknown. Second,
instabilities in the shear layer lead to a strong fluctuation of the circulation flux over
time due to KHIs.
Consequently, the flux evaluation is shifted slightly leeward and away from the solid
structure, and a spatial average of the shear layer is evaluated to smooth the effects
of instabilities. This four-step approach is illustrated in figure 6. First, the average
velocity of the shear layer is evaluated in the red dashed area behind the plate to
determine the shear-layer orientation. This direction is then aligned with the y0-axis
of a .x0; y0/ coordinate system. A close-up of this tilted .x0; y0/ domain (solid red box)
is shown in figure 6(b). Profiles of spatially averaged velocity huy0 iy0 and out-of-plane
vorticity h!'iy0 along y0 are shown in figure 6(c). The origin of x0 is set to collapse
with the maximum of h!'iy0 . The spatial filter along y0 minimises the influence of
remaining PIV uncertainties and small-scale instabilities in the shear layer.
FIGURE 7. Force history Cd.s/ for all plate geometries and Re; the shaded area indicates
the scatter through a 2 uncertainty margin. Significant force deviations for the np D 12
plate are emphasised in the close-up of panel (b).
Despite slight shear-layer thickness variations, a band of ô€€€0:025D < x0 < 0:025D
was found to be a reasonable and robust domain for the circulation-flux calculation,
since !' 0 in the vicinity of the shear layer:

Note that more accurate strategies to approximate the shear-layer thickness (see e.g.
Brown & Roshko 1974) do not apply for the present data, as only  5â€“6 velocity
vectors are found within the width of the shear layer itself.
3. Results
First, the impact of edge undulations and Re scaling on the overall force histories
is evaluated in Â§ 3.1. Complementary to force measurements, velocity and ensembleaveraged
vorticity fields provide insight into the underlying flow patterns for varying
VFE modifications and Re, as addressed in Â§ 3.2.
3.1. Forces
The force histories of each run were temporally filtered with a least-squares estimator
as per Savitzky & Golay (1964) and ensemble-averaged across 20 runs. Subsequent
normalisation of the force (drag) was performed as follows:
Cd D
2jFzj
AU21
; (3.1)
as presented in figure 7. To further check the repeatability of the measurements and
uncover significant case-to-case variations, two standard deviations .2/ are added
to the plots. The small uncertainty margins during acceleration, with its associated
added-mass peak (0:06s60:5), relaxation stage (0:5<s<2:5) and the stable vortexgrowth
stage (2:5 6 s 6 5 for Re D 50 000, 2:5 6 s 6 9 for Re D 350 000) indicate
good repeatability. Once the flow destabilises and detaches from the plate, the run-torun
scatter increases by an order of magnitude, which indicates the sensitivity of this
instability-triggered topology change. Finally, beyond s >20, the fully separated and
turbulent flow collapses to similar terminal values Cd, which implies that this stage is
stable and highly repeatable again.
Interestingly, no significant variations of the drag coefficient are found between
the circular reference plate and the small-scale modifications np D 50 and np D 200
for both Re â€“ despite considerable changes in the perimeter. Only the force history
of the np D 12 plate deviates from the circular base case, which still lies within the
uncertainty margin for ReD50 000 (see figure 7a). For ReD350 000, in contrast, the
np D12 plate generates a significantly higher force during the vortex-growth stage as
compared to the reference and small-scale cases. A close-up of this difference is added
to figure 7(b) so as to emphasise the 20% offset in relation to the small uncertainty
margin. Note that the abscissa of the inset starts from s D 2:0, since the forces
are significantly higher during the early acceleration (s 6 0:5) and relaxation
(0:5 < s < 2:5). During the acceleration, the forces collapse for identical plate
cross-sections A.
The force deviation for the stable vortex-growth stage implies that the largeamplitude
VFE modification of the np D 12 plate significantly influences the vortex
formation process. However, the vortex topology remains similar in the wake.
Consequently, the wavy shear layer still rolls up into a vortex, which remains
attached to the plate for a comparable duration as with the circular reference case.
To explore these differences, we now turn to the flow fields.
3.2. Field data
To compare the early vortex formation process (1:25 6 s 6 2:25) of the various
plate geometries, the vorticity fields for all cases are shown in figures 8 and 9 for
Re D 50 000 and Re D 350 000, respectively. Note that only selected vorticity fields
are displayed here for the sake of brevity. The complete temporal evolution (s <2:3)
of all cases is provided in a supplementary movie (see Movie1.mp4) available at
https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2019.908.
The circular plate (Base, np D 1) and the high-wavenumber plates (np D 50 and
np D 200) reveal similar results in the force measurements for both Re (see figure 7).
The corresponding PIV measurements confirm these results, where the similarity of the
extracted vorticity fields (see figures 8 and 9) indicates that similar topologies during
the early relaxation stage (s D 1:25) and during the late relaxation stage (s D 2:25)
are equivalent for the three geometries (np 2 f1; 200; 50g) and both Re. The strong
repeatability of the measurements, furthermore, leads to clear visualisations of the
dominant KHI. Neither disturbances smaller than the shear-layer thickness  (B < 1,
np D200) nor disturbances of the same order of magnitude (B1, np D50) affect the
instability mechanism or lead to significant corruption of the KHI. Also, the influence
of Re onto the instabilities is small, since the same spatial offsets of consecutive
KHI structures are found in the shear layer for both Re; compare figures 8(a)â€“(i)
and 9(a)â€“(i). It is important to mention at this point that this finding does not hold for
the earlier stage of plate acceleration (s <0:5), as reported by Rosi & Rival (2017).
The similarity between the circular case and the small-scale VFE modifications
(np 2 f1; 200; 50g) indicates that the shear-layer formation smoothes the spanwise

spatial disturbances smaller than or in the range of the shear-layer thickness (B 6 1).
The force histories (see Â§ 3.1) and also the vorticity fields of the smallest tested
wavenumber np D 12 lead to the observation that such geometrical disturbances
become influential once their length scale  exceeds the shear-layer thickness itself
(B1).
1:25 6 s 6 2:25 for all plate geometries. Similar results for no and small-scale VFE
modifications (np 2 f1; 200; 50g). Note that the KHI spacing remains constant for
the small-scale VFE modifications (np 2 f1; 200; 50g), but is reduced for np D 12 at
ReD350 000 compared to ReD50 000, cf. figure 8.
Figures 8( j)â€“(o) and 9( j)â€“(o) present the early evolution of the vortex in the
12top and 12bot measurement plane, where the laser sheet cuts the vortex at the
maximum and minimum radius of the plate, respectively. The non-circular shape
of the vorticity maximum in the vortex core can be associated with significant
vortex stretching. Figure 10 presents the out-of-plane gradient of the out-of-plane
velocity .1=r/ @u'=@'. Furthermore, in contrast to the high-wavenumber geometries
(np 2 f1; 200; 50g), the main part of the vortical structure in the 12top plane is
located at a smaller radius than the maximum radius of the undulated vortex edge at
R D D=2 C a. Recent surface pressure measurements on wings by Eslam Panah et al.
(2015) and Akkala & Buchholz (2017) provide evidence that this vortex position
leads to an adverse pressure gradient in parts of the boundary layer between vortex
and plate, which in turn results in a flux of (positive) vorticity from the plate into
the vortex (see also Lighthill 1963). While the positive vorticity in the boundary
layer between the leeward side of the plate and the vortex wake is not sufficiently
well resolved in the PIV measurements, the advected positive vorticity is clearly
visible in figures 8( j)â€“(l) and 9( j)â€“(l). The advected vorticity cross-annihilates with
the shear-layer vorticity and thus reduces the circulation growth of the vortex itself.
In addition, this cross-annihilation also changes the wavelength of the KHI, which
â€“ in contrast to the geometries np 2 f1; 200; 50g â€“ varies significantly between the
low- and high-Re case. Interestingly, the 12top case comprises significant amounts of
engulfment from the irrotational outer region between the shear layer and the vortex.
Figures 8 and 9 reveal differences during the early stages of vortex formation
between the high-wavenumber cases (np 2 f1; 200; 50g) and the low-wavenumber
case .np D 12/. Despite the topological differences between these cases, the drag
coefficient Cd is similar for all geometries and Re during the plates acceleration and
the relaxation stage. Only for the high-Re case .Re D 350 000/ and for later stages
(s > 2:5) do significant differences between the cases exist, which in turn motivated
the additional PIV experiments for 2:3 6s 6 6 and ReD350 000; cf. Â§ 2.2.
The resulting vorticity fields for the circular and np D 12 plates are shown in
figure 11 and are available in a supplementary movie (see Movie2.mp4). A secondary
vortex appears near the plate centre in all measurements. In comparison with figure 9,
the shear layer weakens for both cases. Yet the shear layer remains more pronounced
for the non-circular plate (np D12). However, the interaction of shear layer and vortex
core varies between the circular and the non-circular plate. At s D3, the shear layer
of the circular plate gets deflected by the vortex core, convects around the vortex
centre, and eventually merges with the low-vorticity region in the core vicinity. At the
largest plate radius of the small-wavenumber plate (12top), the shear layer is furthest
from the core, where parts of the shear layer even start to convect into the wake
from s D 3; see figure 11(d) and supplementary movie Movie2.mp4. In contrast, the
shear layer at the smallest plate radius (12bot) directly convects into the vortex core,

as indicated in figure 11(g)â€“(i). The vortex core behind the circular plate remains
coherent within the measured FOV s <6. The vortex core boundaries â€“ as introduced
in Â§ 2.3 â€“ enclose a small area where rotation dominates shear. The corresponding
core boundary for the np D12 plate appears larger and accordingly comprises a more
diffuse vortex core. Furthermore, the area of the overall vortex is larger, while its
maximum vorticity is smaller due to turbulent mixing. The secondary vortex near
the np D 12 plate centre is found to be corrupted and, therefore, less pronounced as
compared to the circular plate.
4. Discussion
This section focuses on a quantitative comparison between vortex formation on the
plate with wavenumber np D12 and the circular base case. Simple models are applied
to elucidate the physics behind the most important observations stated in Â§ 3 and the
influence of the ratio B; see (1.1). First, the changes in shear layers for varying plate
geometries and their effects on the vortex circulation are analysed (Â§ 4.1). Second, a
discussion on how the vortices stay attached to the plate for similar periods of time,
even though the vortex wake behind the np D 12 plate is significantly less coherent

vortex wake.
(Â§ 4.2), is presented. Finally, the physical mechanism behind the changes in force
is addressed (Â§ 4.3) by considering the momentum and size of the vortex wake and
estimating the pressure in front of and behind the plates.
4.1. Feeding shear layer and vortex wake circulation
When recalling the similar spacing of KHIs (figures 8 and 9), it was hypothesised that
the shear-layer thicknesses  for both Re under consideration would be similar. This is
confirmed in figure 12. Applying the methods introduced in Â§ 2.3, figure 12 presents
the averaged vorticity distribution perpendicular to the shear layer. No significant
influence of Re on the shear-layer thickness  is observed.
The similarities between all high-wavenumber plates (B 6 1, np 2 f1; 50; 200g),
as observed in Â§Â§ 3.1 and 3.2, are confirmed. In contrast, the maximal vorticity in
the shear layer is consistently higher for the np D 12 plate (B  1). However, with
regards to the temporal change of circulation in the vortex, the higher vorticity in the
shear layer is balanced by a flux of oppositely signed vorticity from the leeward side
of the plate during the early stages (figure 12b,c), as parts of the fed vorticity are
directly annihilated. For the later stages of the vortex formation process (s > 2:5),
less vorticity diffuses from the leeward boundary layer (see figure 12d). Yet the shear
layer is still more pronounced compared to the circular plate. As a consequence, the
circulation fed through the shear layer is higher for np D12 than for the other plates.
Applying (2.4), the circulation flux through the shear layer is evaluated. Figure 13(a)
shows, as expected, high ô€€€Psl during the early stages, where the forces are also higher.
FIGURE 13. (a) Circulation flux through the feeding shear layer ô€€€Psl for 1 < s < 6 for
the varying cases at Re D 350 000. Blue lines depict the average of 12top and 12bot.
(b) Accumulated circulation in the vortex wake for 1<s <6.
During the stable vortex growth (s > 2:5), ô€€€Psl remains fairly constant for each
geometry. However, the circulation flux of the small-wavenumber plate (np D 12) is
higher than for the circular reference case. The overall circulation behind the plate,
and as such in the vortex wake, is captured in figure 13(b). Despite the differing
circulation flux through the feeding shear layers, the temporal development of overall
circulation in the vortex is similar. A superposition of various circulation-reducing
mechanisms in the vortex itself is hypothesised as mechanisms to limit the circulation
growth:
(i) reorientation of vorticity, followed by cross-annihilation in the turbulent vortex
wake;
(ii) loss of circulation due to convection of vorticity into the wake;
(iii) interaction and cross-annihilation of vorticity in the primary vortex with the
vorticity in the secondary vortex; and
(iv) interaction of the vortex with the boundary layer on the leeward side of the plate.
The above mechanisms are more pronounced in the highly turbulent wake of the noncircular
geometry (B1, np D 12) and, as such, compensate for the higher ô€€€Psl. As
a consequence, there only remain small differences in the overall circulation budget
(see figure 13b).
4.2. Vortex core and its stability
The position of the vortex centre is estimated by the maximum of the Q-criterion (see
Â§ 2.3) and is presented in figure 14(a). The undulatory shape of the small-wavenumber
plate (np D12) influences the vortex core radius rc and its distance from the plate zc.
Relative to the circular plate (Base), rc is either larger (12top) or smaller (12bot). Yet
the average position (blue solid line) is similar to the radial position of the circular
plateâ€™s vortex centre. However, the axial position zc increases more quickly for the
small-wavenumber plate np D12 than for the circular plate (dashed lines).
The distinct rc values in the 12top and 12bot planes suggest an undulatory
shape of the vortex wake, which most likely results in a significant radial vorticity

component !r in between the measurement planes 12top and 12bot and induces
stretching of the vortex core as depicted in figure 10. The stretching contributes
to the qualitative differences between the different plates concerning the coherence,
symmetry and size of the vortex core reported in Â§ 3.2 and further discussed utilising
figure 14(b) and (c). The magnitude of velocity (jurj) and the vorticity (!') are
presented in a horizontal cut through the vortex centre .rc; zc/ (see dashed blue
line in figure 6). Note that, while ur is the radial velocity in the coordinate system
introduced in Â§ 2, it also represents the azimuthal velocity of the vortex wake itself.
Maxworthy (1977) defines the horizontal distance between the velocity peaks on
both sides of the vortex core as the core diameter dz (see figure 14b). This dz provides
similar results to the reduced vortex core diameter d defined in Â§ 2 (see figure 15a,b).
The vorticity peak of the circular plateâ€™s vortex is higher, while its diameter dz is
significantly smaller as for the plate with np D12.
As mentioned in Â§ 1.2, Maxworthy (1972) related the laminar-to-turbulent transition
of a vortex ring with an azimuthal instability. The vortex core of diameter d develops
a wavy structure along the ring with radius rc (similar to the shape of the geometries
in this study), which amplifies in time and finally corrupts the vortex core itself. The
onset and wavelength of the azimuthal instability depends on Re. Counter-intuitively,
smaller Re lead to an earlier onset of instability (Maxworthy 1977). While the
findings of Maxworthy are based on careful analysis of pistonâ€“cylinder vortex
generators, Fernando & Rival (2016b) captured the same instability mechanism
for the vortex formation on a circular plate and observed an earlier vortex pinch-off
for smaller Re. Combining the earlier vortex pinch-off for smaller Re observed by
Fernando & Rival (2016b) with the earlier onset of the instability for smaller Re
observed by Maxworthy (1977) suggests a causal relationship between the vortex

the vortex core. Furthermore, the additional mixing results in a more diffuse (and as
such larger) vortex core.
Figure 14(b) supports modelling the vortex core as a Rankine vortex, and thus its
core as a solid-body rotation. Applying this model, the pressure difference between

where ô€€€c is the circulation of the core. Equation (4.1) clarifies that both effects of
transition, the reduction of jô€€€cj as well as the increasing core diameter d, decrease
the magnitude of the pressure minimum in the core. This leads to vortex pinch-off, as
the attracting forces from the vortex core towards the plate are eventually insufficient
to avoid pinch-off.
While explaining the Re scaling of the vortex stability in the wake of a circular
plate, the chain of events described above contradicts at first glance the fact that the
vortex behind the np D12 plate is stable. For this geometry, even before the onset of
an azimuthal instability, the vortex core is already turbulent. This turbulence leads to
a growth of the vortex core size: d and dz (figure 15a,b). Hence, according to (4.1), a
comparable core pressure minimum similar to the circular plate can only exist if the
core circulation also grows in time. The magnitude of core circulation jô€€€cj (see (2.3))
is shown in figure 15(c). While jô€€€cj slightly decreases over time for the circular plate,
jô€€€cj increases in the vortex core of the np D12 plate. The growth of jô€€€cj results from
the direct merging of shear layer and vortex core at the lowest plate radius (12bot,
see Â§ 3.2 and in particular figure 11gâ€“i). As a consequence, even though the vortex
formation and as such the physics behind the stabilisation are distinct, the magnitude
of the pressure minimum is similar for both plate geometries and both vortex cores
stay attached to the plate.
The quantitative evaluation of the vortex wake circulation ô€€€ (figure 13b), the radial
position of the vortex centre rc (figure 14a) and the approximate pressure at the vortex
centre (4.1) provide similar results. As such, the physical phenomenon behind the
force enhancement up to 20% (see Â§ 3.1) for the small-wavenumber plate (np D 12)
as yet remains unclear and is addressed in the following. Two distinct approaches to
reconstruct forces from the measured data are applied. First, the momentum of the
flow is discussed. It provides an intuitive explanation for the force enhancement but
does not resolve the measured propulsion force to its full extent. This is achieved by
the second approach, i.e. the evaluation of the pressure at the plateâ€™s surface.
Motivated by the different observed vortex sizes during the later stages of the
measurement (see figure 11), a simple model is applied to estimate the influence of
vortex volume growth on the rate of change of momentum and as such the propulsion
force. By assuming the vortex of growing volume V travels with approximately the
same velocity as the plate U1, the momentum in the axial direction can be split into
the contribution of the vortex momentum, Iv DVU1, and the momentum of the also
time-dependent flow outside of the vortex, Io:
Iz DIv CIo DVU1 CIo: (4.2)
During the later stages of vortex formation (s > 2:5), where distinct forces
were measured for the different geometries, the plate velocity U1 is constant. The
approximated force results in
Fz DIPz DFv CFo DVPU1 C P Io; (4.3)
where Fv D P Iv DVPU1 and Fo D P Io. The fluid mass V, which travels with the plate,
and as such can be considered as part of the vortex, is analysed in the following.
Multiple mechanisms lead to a growing vortex mass V. The vorticity-containing
shear layer feeds mass into the vortex volume (Wong, Kriegseis & Rival 2013). In
addition, turbulent entrainment (Rosi & Rival 2018), as well as engulfment of inviscid
fluid (e.g. figure 9), adds additional mass to the vortex core. The additional fluid,
which subsequently travels with the propulsor, also requires momentum. Similar to
the findings of McPhaden & Rival (2018), equation (4.3) suggests that the change
of vortex volume influences the propulsion forces. To approximate the instantaneous
vortex volume V, the topology of the flow is analysed. The streamline originating
in the node behind the plate is identified (red line in figure 16a) and the underlying
vortex volume is defined as V. Figure 16(b) shows the temporal evolution of the vortex
volumes. The large disturbances due to the undulatory VFE of plate 12 result in a
turbulent vortex wake and thus in additional entrainment. For the small-wavenumber
plate (np D 12), the volume is estimated by linear interpolation between the results
from 12top and 12bot. A linear fit on V (figure 16b) is utilised to estimate the force
contribution Fv of the growing vortex wake of the respective geometries (F12
v and
FBase
v ) in the interval 3 6 s 6 6; see figure 17(a). The trends of the reconstructed
forces Fv are consistent with the trends of the forces measured by the force transducer
Fz, i.e. F12
v >FBase
v . However, Fz is not reproduced to its full extent, as the contribution
of Fo is unknown and missing.
To obtain a more accurate force reconstruction, the pressure distribution at the plate
is estimated. Multiple steps are performed for each dataset: the circular plate (Base),
12top and 12bot.

casts a shadow (see figure 4b). The flow field in the shadowed area is

approach of Kling et al. (2019) at s D 4:5 for (a) the circular plate, (b) 12top
and (c) 12bot. The vortex wake of the circular plate shows steeper pressure gradients,
resulting in a higher pressure at the leeward side of the plate and, as such, a smaller
propulsion force. Owing to the unknown out-of-plane velocity/gradients in the highly threedimensional
vortex core of the undulated plate (see figure 10), the core area is excluded
from the pressure calculation for 12top and 12bot.
the plate (dotted line) and the symmetry of the flow (dashed line) are utilised as
Neumann boundary conditions (NBC).
(2) In addition, the potential flow solver is used to extend the limited FOV of the
measurement. NBC are applied at the boundaries of the flow area of interest
(see figure 17c). While the measured velocity data provide NBC at the FOV
boundaries (solid lines), the far-field NBC are estimated to be ur D 0 at the
upper and lower boundaries (dashed lines) and uz D 0 at the windward and
leeward boundaries (dotted lines). Note that these far-field NBC are only an
approximation. To reduce the influence of these imperfect NBC, a large area of
13D4D is selected to reconstruct the far field.
(3) The pressure field p is evaluated by applying the ensemble-based pressure
estimation method of Kling et al. (2019). An ensemble-based Reynolds
decomposition is applied on the divergence of the momentum equation. Kling
et al. (2019) calculate the Reynolds stresses by means of the variance and
covariance of the ensemble-averaged data at a single time instant. As only 20
runs were performed in the present experiment, the method is extended by
an additional moving temporal average in the plate-fixed frame of reference
over 100 time steps. Furthermore, due to the two-dimensional measurements
in the present study, u', @ur=@' and @uz=@' are unknown. Therefore, for the
undulated plate, the vortex core is excluded from the pressure reconstruction, as
significant out-of-plane gradients exist in this region (see figure 10). The far-field
solution estimated in the previous step of the calculation allows application of
the required Dirichlet boundary condition p0 Dconst. far away from the plate, in
particular at the upper boundary of the far-field solution. The NBC are derived
from the momentum equations. The estimated pressure fields 1p D p ô€€€ p0 are
presented in figure 18 for s D4:5.
4) The reconstructed axial force resulting from the pressure field Fp is evaluated by
integration of the pressure along the plateâ€™s front and back surfaces:

The net force on the undulatory plate (npD12) is estimated by averaging between
the two measurement planes F12
p DF12bot
p CF12top
p .
Despite the limitations of the two-dimensional data and the limited number of
measurement planes, the estimated forces Fp closely resemble the forces measured by
the transducer Fz (see figure 17a). This good agreement of the integral value provides
evidence to further interpret the instantaneous pressure fields presented in figure 18:
the larger and more diffuse vortex core in the wake of the undulatory plate results in
less steep pressure gradients and thus in a lower pressure at the leeward side of the
plate, which in turn explains the higher propulsion force.
5. Conclusions
The convergence of unsteady propulsion in nature for a broad range of Re at first
glance suggests a minor impact of turbulence and small-scale structures on vortex
formation. Conversely, recent studies on free shear layers and the influence of Re
on entrainment refute this argument. This study explores the impact of small-scale
coherent structures on vortex formation. This problem is, on the one hand, addressed
by performing measurements for a wide range of Re, where at higher Re it is expected
that the size of the smallest structures in the flow will be reduced. On the other
hand, disturbances of distinct wavelengths  are introduced into to flow. Motivated
by varying undulations on propulsors of swimming animals, the disturbances are
introduced into the flow by modifying the VFE of accelerating low-aspect-ratio plates.
The relation BD=.2/ (see (1.1)) hereby describes the height of the undulation =2
relative to the length scale of the shear-layer thickness . As such, this study explores
the influence of varying edge undulation on vortex formation over wide ranges of B
and Re.
Conclusions relating to the scaling of B and Re are categorised below with regard
to vortex stability and forces on the propulsor.
(1) The influence of edge undulations strongly depends on the relation B. The
shear layer and, as such, the forming vortex are found to be insensitive to VFE
modifications smaller than or similar to the shear-layer thickness . The vortex
formation process is only affected significantly for large-scale VFE modifications
(B1).
(2) For B  1, the force is increased during the stable vortex-growth stage. Up
to 20% higher forces are measured in the present study. A change in vortex
volume growth and a more diffuse vortex core are identified as the cause of
these variations. This observed increase in force is likely one cause for the
undulatory VFE modifications observed in nature.
(3) For all geometries tested here, the wake vortices remain stable over an equivalent
normalised distance. Yet a different mechanism stabilises the vortex for large 
(B  1). The vortex wake for the circular base case depends on the coherence
of its vortex core to remain stable. Transition due to azimuthal instabilities leads
to vortex pinch-off. For larger VFE modifications B  1, the vortex core is
turbulent from the start. However, the circulation of the turbulent and spatially
expanding core grows continuously, preserving the magnitude of the required
pressure minimum inside the core.
(4) For small VFE modifications (B61) other than the known Re scaling associated
with the azimuthal instability (Fernando & Rival 2016b), no additional scaling
was observed. In accordance with findings on quasi-steady free shear layers
(Ho & Huerre 1984), neither the spacing of KHIs nor the shear-layer thickness
 vary within the available accuracy of the data and within the Re range
under consideration. The existence and the effects of coherent structures that
are significantly smaller than the observed KHIs cannot be evaluated with the
available data. Repeating the high-resolution particle tracking experiments of
Rosi & Rival (2018) for the quasi-steady regime of the flow could provide
insight if additional entrainment due to very small structures occurs at high Re.
In contrast, for the case of B  1, higher Re leads to smaller spacing of the
KHIs. Following the model of Rosi & Rival (2017), the smaller spacing could
result in higher entrainment, a faster-growing vortex volume and consequently a
higher overall force. As such, the higher impact of coarse VFE modifications in
cases of larger Re can be motivated by the observed smaller KHI spacing.
By selecting an impulsively accelerated, rigid circular plate as the canonical
base flow of the present study, the effects of VFE undulations are isolated from
other influencing factors such as propulsor flexibility, varying propulsor shape and
complex kinematics, as found in nature and engineering applications. It is, therefore,
hypothesised that proper VFE undulation design (B1), convective mixing inside the
vortex and entrainment along the vortex boundaries should also increase and affect
the overall forces for more complex base flows. However, future detailed studies
will be required to test these complex interactions. As a final remark, it is also
worth mentioning that the present study mainly focuses on the later stages of vortex
formation, due to the distinct propulsion forces measured for s > 2:5. Future work
could address the early stages of vortex formation s < 0:5, where the plate is still
accelerated, and extend the work of Rosi & Rival (2017) by assessing the influence
of distinct acceleration rates on the vortex wake of undulated plates.

A new approach to estimate the aerosol scattering ratios for the atmospheric
correction of satellite remote sensing data in coastal regions
Aerosol scattering reflectance is the most uncertain term to be determined in the atmospheric correction of
satellite remote sensing data. The values in the visible bands depend on the aerosol scattering ratios (the epsilon
spectrum). The epsilon value in the Near-infrared (NIR) band is estimated on the dark pixel assumption
of the water-leaving reflectance in the two NIR bands and then the epsilon spectrum is determined from the
aerosol models. This assumption usually becomes invalid for turbid coastal waters, leading to lost regions in
the satellite imagery masked by the failure of the atmospheric correction. A new approach was developed to
accurately estimate epsilon from turbid coastal waters. This method is based on the idea that the aerosol scattering
reflectance and the epsilon values can be obtained from the known water-leaving reflectance of in situ
measurements. The water-leaving reflectance is determined from the choice of a look-up table of the
water-leaving reflectance based on the Angstrom law of the candidate aerosol scattering reflectance using
the best non-linear least squares fit function. In this approach, the entire epsilon spectra can be obtained
and used to determine the two closest aerosol models which are used to interpolate the actual epsilon values.
It is demonstrated that the results from matching the entire spectra are more robust than that obtained from
using only one epsilon value. The performance of the approach was evaluated using the simulated reflectance
at the top of the atmosphere, the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, and in situ
measured aerosol optical thickness. This approach is based on the assumption of the aerosol scattering reflectance
following the Angstrom law instead of the standard dark pixel assumption, named as the ENLF model.
This new assumption is valid for both Case 1 and Case 2 waters, even over terrestrial regions. Therefore, the
ENLF model provides a potential approach for a universal algorithm of the atmospheric correction of satellite
remote sensing data.
1. Introduction
While the Rayleigh scattering radiances can be accurately determined
for use in the atmospheric correction of satellite ocean color
remote sensing data, the aerosol scattering reflectance is the main uncertain
term to be determined. Normally, measurements in two
near-infrared (NIR) bands are used to retrieve the aerosol properties
on the assumption of zero water-leaving reflectance at these bands.
However, this assumption is not valid in either Case 2 or highly productive
Case 1 waters, leading to the failure of the atmospheric correction
(Mao et al., 2012; Wang & Shi, 2005). Several approaches
have been developed to overcome this problem for relatively ideal
satellite imagery over turbid waters. These include using the aerosol
scattering reflectance over neighboring clear waters for Case 2 waters
(Hu et al., 2000; Mao et al., 2001), assuming spatial homogeneity of
the NIR band ratio (Ruddick et al., 2000), employing spectral shape
matching methods (Shanmugan & Ahn, 2007), or using a regional
empirical relationship between water reflectance at the red and NIR
bands (Ahn et al., 2012). However, since the spatial and temporal distributions
of aerosols usually vary greatly in the satellite imagery,
these approaches have limited use in operational satellite data processing
systems. The two short wave infrared (SWIR, 1.24 and
1.64 μm) bands were used for atmospheric correction for Moderate
resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data because the
dark pixel assumption (DPA) was valid in the SWIR bands over turbid
waters (Wang, 2007; Wang & Shi, 2005). However, Knaeps et al.
(2012) pointed out that slight radiance contributions in the 1.24 μm
band were observed in extremely turbid waters and a modification
of the SWIR algorithm was needed.
The ratio of the aerosol scattering reflectance in two NIR bands is
used to obtain the epsilon spectrum on the matchup of aerosol
models. This spectrum is used to extrapolate the magnitudes of the
aerosol scattering reflectance at visible bands from the value at NIR.
According to Wang (2007), when the Sea-viewing Wide Field-ofview
Sensor (SeaWiFS) Band 8 (0.865 μm) is used as a reference,
the epsilon values at Band 1 (0.412 μm) vary between 0.9 (O99
model) and 2.6 (T50 model), implying that the magnitudes of the
aerosol scattering reflectance can vary about 3 fold depending upon
the choice of aerosol models. Therefore, correctly estimating epsilon
becomes one of the critical factors affecting the estimate of the
water-leaving reflectance. More concerning, when the SWIR band
(2.130 μm) is used as a reference band, the magnitudes of epsilon at
0.340 μm vary between 0.7 and 22.6, leading to a more than 30 fold
variation of the aerosol scattering reflectance for the same aerosol optical
thickness (AOT). It should be noted that the accuracy of the atmospheric
correction is much more sensible to epsilon values when
SWIR bands are used and high signal to noise ratio of the sensor is
needed for these bands. In fact, since SWIR bands have in general
lower SNR values than visible and NIR bands (Knaeps et al., 2012),
it obviously limits the accuracy of the atmospheric correction when
the dark pixel assumption (DPA) method of SWIR bands is applied.
The problemof the atmospheric correction in Case 2waters is caused
by that both the aerosol scattering reflectance and thewater-leaving reflectance
become unknown terms. If the water-leaving reflectance becomes
a known term, the aerosol scattering reflectance can then be
extracted and the epsilon values are accurately estimated. Therefore, it
is critical to determine the water-leaving reflectance in the approach
of epsilon estimation for Case 2 waters.
In the standard atmospheric correction procedure, twelve aerosol
models have been used to define the epsilon values for different geometric
angles (Gordon & Wang, 1994). The epsilon value extracted
from the aerosol scattering reflectance in the two SWIR (or NIR)
bands is used to find the two closest aerosol models for interpolation.
Due to amplifying effects of epsilon extrapolated from SWIR to visible
bands, the aerosol scattering reflectance in the visible bands is sensitive
to the small variations of epsilon in the SWIR band. For example,
a small calibration error in MODIS data for the two SWIR bands will
lead to a small error of the retrieval epsilon in those bands (Wang &
Shi, 2005), but the error may be amplified by 10 times for other
bands. If the epsilon spectra over all bands could be obtained and
used to find the two closest aerosol models, the results would become
much more robust.
In this paper,we developed a newapproach to estimate epsilon that
is suitable for both turbid coastal regions and oceanic waters. The AOT
measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) are
used to analyze the relationship of the aerosol scattering reflectance
among different bands in Section 3. A look-up table of the typical
water-leaving reflectance is established using the in situ measurements
fromthe East China Sea (ECS) in Section 4. A detailed description of the
epsilon approach is given in Section 5. The performance of the approach
is evaluated in Section 6, with the first subsection (Section 6.1) analyzing
simulated reflectance data, the second subsection (Section 6.2)
comparing results applied to SeaWiFS data with the standard method,
and the third subsection (Section 6.3) comparing the match-up between
SeaWiFS data and in situ AOT results, and the accuracy of epsilon
is evaluated. Comparisons are made among different values of the
water-leaving reflectance in the look-up tables presented in the Discussion
section (Section 7).
2. The epsilon problem of the standard atmospheric correction in
Case 2 waters
It is well known that the processing of satellite data using the
standard atmospheric correction usually fails over turbid coastal regions.
One of the main reasons is the difficulty in accurately determining
the epsilon values because the water-leaving radiance in the
two NIR bands are usually much higher than zero in the coastal waters.
An example of epsilon computed from a SeaWiFS image using
the DPA method is shown in Fig. 1.
In coastal regions, the epsilon values in the NIR band are around
1.4, which is roughly 30% higher than its mean value. If these values
are used to extrapolate epsilon to the other wavelength bands, the
value in SeaWiFS Band 1 (0.412 μm) becomes 7.63 which may overestimate
the aerosol scattering reflectance by at least 4.5 times of its
actual value. The overestimation of the aerosol scattering reflectance
will lead to significantly underestimating the magnitudes of the
water-leaving reflectance in visible bands, even generating some negative
values (Shanmugan & Ahn, 2007; Shi &Wang, 2007). The failure
of the atmospheric correction leaves lost regions in the satellite imagery,
over 52,000 km2 in this image. These regions cover the estuary
and coastal zones, very important for the interaction between the terrestrial
and marine environments.
This overestimation is easily detected and its primary cause is that
the water-leaving reflectance is wrongly attributed as part of the
aerosol scattering reflectance in the two NIR bands. There are also
other factors that affect the estimation of epsilon in NIR band, such
as the bias of satellite sensor calibration, uncertainty of the Rayleigh
scattering reflectance, and absorption effects of atmospheric gases.
For example, the O2 A-band absorption may reduce the SeaWiFS measured
reflectance in Band 7 by more than 10–15% (Ding & Gordon,
1995; Wang, 1999). These factors definitely affect the accuracy of
the epsilon estimates, although they are usually difficult to be
detected in satellite imagery. However, due to the amplifying effects
of the extrapolation of epsilon, a small bias in epsilon in the NIR
band may easily lead to a relatively large error in the water-leaving
reflectance at shorter wavelengths. An uncertainty of 5% is assumed
to exist in the NIR band. It then causes the choice of different aerosol
models with a variation of epsilon 0.77 at Band 1, 34% higher than the
true value. A poor selection of the aerosol models may also produce
artifact errors in the processed products (Wang, 2003b). It is important
to establish a suitable approach to accurately estimate the epsilon
for the atmospheric correction.
3. Nonlinear fit of the aerosol scattering reflectance from AOT of
AERONET measurement
As epsilon is used to extrapolate the aerosol reflectance to visible
bands, it is important to understand the relationship of epsilon values
over different bands. The Angstrom constant is usually used to estimate
the epsilon relationship (Gordon & Castano, 1987). However,
Wang and Gordon (1994) concluded that an exponential relationship
would be more accurate for extrapolating epsilon to the other bands.
It is necessary to precisely determine the relationship of epsilon in
visible bands to the NIR band. The AOT dataset of AERONET was
compiled from global distributed data, providing an excellent data
source to analyze the aerosol properties.
AERONET is a ground-based, optical aerosol monitoring network
used to validate the remote sensing algorithmand to ensure the quality
of aerosol products (Holben et al., 1998). The network hardware consists
of automatic Sun–sky scanning radiometers to measure both the
direct and diffuse radiance,which can be used to retrieve aerosol optical
properties such as the AOT, aerosol particle size distribution, complex
refractive index and single scattering albedo (Dubovik et al., 2000).
Data quality control is employed to eliminate errors caused bymeasurement
conditions, such as clouds and biomass burning events (Smirnov
et al., 2000). AERONET has been extended to other applications. For example,
the ocean color component of AERONET (AERONET-OC) has
been used to support long-term satellite ocean color investigations of
autonomous radiometer systems deployed on offshore fixed platforms
(Zibordi et al., 2009a,b).
We obtained AOT data from the AERONET project web page
(http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov). There are a total of 554 measurement
sites in the world, with a total of 7.69 million AOT spectra having
been obtained. Measurements are taken in 16 wavelength bands
ranging from 0.340 to 1.640 μm, with 13 bands selected for wavelengths
from 0.412 to 1.020 μm. Some sites started measurements
from 1999 to now, whereas some just came on-line in 2010. The
number of AOT spectra at each site varies widely, from a maximum
of 65,530 spectra at one site down to a minimum of 12. Because several
different types of instruments are used among these sites, the
spectra bands of AOT measured are different from one site to another.
The site locations are distributed over islands, coastal areas, inland
sites and mountains. Because our focus is on the aerosol types around
the ocean, the 165 sites selected are at altitudes less than 50 m above
sea level with most located near the coastal regions. Some statistical
information on the chosen sites is listed in Table 1.
The mean of the AOT over all spectra is around 0.2, with values decreasing
from0.265 to 0.112 as the wavelength increases. The standard
deviation (STD) of AOT shows a similar pattern to themean values. The
5% lower tail of the total spectral distribution occurs around 0.03 with
minimaclose to zero. The 95% upper tail of the total spectral distribution
occurs around 0.5 with the maxima exceeding 2.0. Since most sites
measured the AOT at 0.440, 0.500, 0.675, 0.870 and 1.020 μm, a set of
AOT collected from 120 sites was established with more than 1.48 million
spectra in these five bands.
According to Gordon and Castano (1989), the aerosol single scattering
reflectance can be calculated from the AOT spectra as:
where ρAS(λ) is the aerosol single scattering reflectance at the top of
the atmosphere (TOA), τa(λ) is the aerosol optical thickness measured
by AERONET, ωa(λ) is the aerosol single scattering albedo,
and Pa(λ) is the aerosol scattering phase function. As many of the
AOT values are higher than 0.1, multiple scattering effects need to
be considered. The aerosol scattering reflectance can be obtained
from where a, b and c are the coefficients of the least squares polynomial fit
which depend on the aerosol models.
As the spectral variations of the AOT of AERONET are quite similar,
it is possible to find a simple equation to describe them. For example,
ρA(λ) is usually assumed to follow the Angstrom law:
where n is the wavelength independent Angstrom exponent, λi is the
wavelength of AERONET band i and λ0 is the reference bandwavelength.
Using the aerosol models from the LOWTRAN-6 models, Wang
and Gordon (1994) concluded that the exponential equation provides
more accurate results than the Angstrom law:
where c is also a constant that depends on the aerosol models chosen
and the viewing geometry.
The extensive measurement set from AERONET provides an excellent
data source for evaluating spectral variations of the aerosol scattering
reflectance. To compare the quality of the spectral fitting functions
for both the Angstrom law and an exponential equation, four aerosol
scattering reflectance of the Mean, Mean plus STD (MS), 5% (P5) and
95% (P95) are selected. The results based on the Angstrom law are
shown in Fig. 2a and those based on the exponential equation are
shown in Fig. 2b.
There are some differences between the observed aerosol spectra
and the fitted spectra for both the Angstrom law and the exponential
equation. The mean relative errors of the P5, Mean, MS, and P95 for
the Angstrom fit are 1.21%, 1.41%, 3.53%, and 0.95%, respectively,
while those for the exponential fit are 4.02%, 4.05%, 6.32%, and
3.71%, respectively. Comparing the fitted situations in Fig. 2, The Angstrom
law is more suitable to describe the spectral shapes of the aerosol
scattering reflectance than the exponential equation.
The nonlinear fit is applied to individual spectrum of AOT and the
mean relative error is calculated from every site, with the results
shown in Fig. 3. The mean relative errors of the fitted aerosol scattering
reflectance are relatively small with most values less than 0.5%.
Half of the sites have errors that are less than 0.16% and 0.30% for
the Angstrom and exponential fits, respectively, with the mean
value of errors of 0.27% and 0.43%, respectively.
When the fitting function is applied to individual spectra the mean
errors become much smaller. The overall average error of the Angstrom
fit is 0.29% and of the exponential fit is 0.47%. Therefore, both
the Angstrom law and the exponential equations provide suitable
fits to the aerosol scattering reflectance data, and because it has a
slightly lower mean error the Angstrom law is used in the remainder
of this paper.
4. The look-up table of in situ water-leaving reflectance
Four cruises were conducted to directly measure the water-leaving
reflectance in the summer and winter of 2006 and in the spring and autumn
of 2007. Each cruise employed two ships (Haijian 46 and Haijian
49) and took about two months to complete the 514 pre-planned stations
in the ECS. The reflectancewas measured by a hyper-spectral spectrometer
manufactured by Analytical Spectral Devices Inc. (ASD). The
ASD instrument was operated following the protocol of the abovewatermethod
(Mueller et al., 2000). As the reflectance can only bemeasured
in the daytime, the actual number of measurement stations was
136, 48, 132, and 143 during the summer, winter, spring, and autumn
cruises, respectively. The spatial distribution of stations is shown in
Fig. 4.
The ASD instrument measures the downward irradiance incident
on the top of a gray plate, the reflected radiance from the sea surface,
and the sky radiance. Each radiance measurement consists of a group
of 20 continuous, simultaneous spectra which can be used to help detect
and remove spectral results contaminated by changes in the environmental
conditions. The methods of Hooker et al. (2002) were
followed to obtain the water-leaving reflectance. The wavelengths
measured by the ASD are from 0.325 to 1.075 μm and the reflectances
in eight bands are computed by the spectral averaging method
according to the SeaWiFS response functions (Mao et al., 2012). A
total of 1496 spectra were measured and 100 spectra were selected
to establish a look-up table of the water-leaving reflectance (Fig. 5).
To make the water-leaving reflectance in the look-up table represent
different types of water in the ECS, a method of selection was developed.
The in situ measured spectra were sorted by the magnitudes
of the reflectance and 100 spectra were selected according to their
position in the magnitude distribution from 0.5% to 99.5% with a 1%
increment. From Fig. 5, the range of the reflectance is large in all 8
bands, even the two NIR bands. The reflectance in Bands 7 and 8
ranges from 0 to 0.06 sr−1, which exceeds the variability of the reflectance
even at visible bands. Obviously, the assumption of zero
water-leaving reflectance is invalid for most of these spectra. These
spectra are used to establish the look-up table of the water-leaving
reflectance to determine the distribution of the actual reflectance in
the ECS.
5. A new approach to estimate the epsilon value from satellite data
The Rayleigh scattering reflectance, the sun glint and whitecap reflectance
can be computed in the atmospheric correction procedure
of satellite data. When the water-leaving reflectance in the two NIR
bands is assumed to be zero, the aerosol scattering reflectance can
be obtained and used to compute epsilon. However, over turbid waters,
this assumption is not valid and its use leads to errors in the estimation
of the epsilon. On the other hand, if the water-leaving
radiance can be determined, the epsilon can be estimated from the
aerosol scattering reflectance over turbid waters.
We define the aerosol–water reflectance, ρAW(λ), including the
aerosol scattering reflectance and the water-leaving reflectance at
TOA, as:
where ρA(λ) is the aerosol scattering reflectance (including Rayleigh–
aerosol interactions) and ρw(λ) is the water-leaving reflectance at
TOA. The aerosol–water reflectance can be deduced from the following:
where ρt(λ) is the satellite measured reflectance at the TOA, ρr(λ) is
the Rayleigh scattering reflectance, T(λ) is the diffuse transmittance
of the atmosphere, and t(λ) is the direct transmittance of the atmosphere.
The term ρwc(λ) is the ocean whitecap reflectance, and
ρg(λ) represents the effects of sun glitter off of the sea surface. The
Rayleigh reflectance can be computed exactly from the Rayleigh lookup
tables based on the vector radiative transfer theory (Wang,
2003a). The whitecap reflectance can be modeled from the sea surface
wind speed (Moore et al., 1999). The sun glint reflectance can
be computed from the sea surface slope distribution (Cox & Munk,
1954). Therefore, ρAW(λ) can be accurately estimated by Eq. (6).
When the water-leaving reflectance is known, ρA(λ), which can be
obtained from the aerosol–water reflectance using Eq. (5), can be
used to estimate the aerosol single scattering reflectance from
where a, b and c are the same coefficients as in Eq. (2). The epsilon spectrum
of the aerosol single scattering reflectance is then defined as
The approach to estimate the epsilon value from the reflectance at
TOA can be summarized as follows:
(1) The Rayleigh scattering reflectance is accurately computed from
themultiple scatteringmethod and the reflectance caused by the
sun-glint and whitecaps is estimated. Then, the aerosol–water
reflectance is obtained from the satellite measured reflectance
using Eq. (6).
(2) A look-up table of the water-leaving reflectance is established
from in situ measurements over the ECS to represent different
types of reflectance.
(3) The candidate aerosol scattering reflectance can be obtained by
subtracting the aerosol–water reflectance from all water-leaving
reflectance in the look-up table, fromwhich with negative values
are removed. The number of the candidate aerosol scattering reflectance
is the same as the reflectance in the look-up table if no
spectra are removed.
(4) The nonlinear least squares fit function based on the Angstrom
lawis used to obtain the best fitted spectrumfor every candidate
aerosol scattering reflectance to compute the difference. The one
with the smallest difference is selected as the actual aerosol
scattering reflectance.
(5) The aerosol single scattering reflectance is estimated from the
aerosol scattering reflectance using Eq. (7), which is then used
in Eq. (8) to obtain the epsilon spectrum.
(6) The epsilon spectrum is used to match the two closest aerosol
models for interpolation to obtain the actual epsilon values.
Matching of the entire spectrum instead of just one value in the
NIR band provides a more stable estimate of epsilon.
Overall, this approach to estimate the epsilon primarily relies on
the assumption of the aerosol scattering reflectance following the
Angstrom law by using the non-linear fit function of the reflectance
under the help of the look-up table of the water-leaving reflectance,
named as the ENLF model.
6. Evaluation of the ENLF model
6.1. Evaluating the ENLF model using the simulation method
The sensor reflectance at the TOA can be simulated from the sum
of its components (Mao et al., 2010). To evaluate the performance
of the ENLF model, only the aerosol–water reflectance needs to be
simulated. The water-leaving reflectance at the TOA can be estimated
from the spectra of the look-up table using:
ρwðλÞ ¼ tðλÞρwnðλÞ cos θs ð Þ; ð9Þ
where ρwn(λ) is the normalized water-leaving reflectance from the
look-up table, θs is the solar-zenith angle and t(λ) is the direct transmittance
of the atmosphere which can be estimated by the method of
Gordon and Wang (1992). The aerosol scattering reflectance in the
reference band is calculated using Eq. (1) with an AOT of 0.12 and
the reflectance in other bands are obtained using Eq. (3) with an Angstrom
constant of 1.1. These parameter values are close to the mean
of the AOT in the AERONET. This aerosol scattering reflectance and
epsilon are taken as the reference to test the performance of the
ENLF model for simulated data. The simulated aerosol–water reflectance
at the TOA is obtained using Eq. (5).
Following the procedure of the ENLF model, the aerosol single
scattering reflectance is obtained from the simulated data using
Steps 2 to 5, and then the epsilon is computed. A total of 1496 epsilon
spectra were obtained, and it is infeasible to show them in one figure.
Therefore, five typical epsilon spectra with different relative errors
are selected and shown in Fig. 6, together with the reference epsilon.
In general, most of the epsilon spectra (not shown) are relatively
close to the reference one and are similar to Spectra 2 results. Still,
there are some spectra with larger variability such as the result of
Spectra 3. The aerosol–water reflectance at the TOA is sensitive to
the settings of several parameters and these parameters become unknown
when the reflectance is used to retrieve the epsilon with the
ENLF model. For example, the water-leaving reflectance at the TOA
simulated from the in situ measurements depends upon the transmittance
of the atmosphere, which becomes difficult to be extracted exactly
from the simulated reflectance. This situation will also happen
when retrieving the epsilon from satellite remote sensing data using
the ENLF model.
Most of the retrieved epsilon spectra followthe Angstromlaw,while
some shapes of epsilon modulate according to the wavelengths, for example,
Spectra 1, 3 and 5 in Fig. 6. These spectra need to be corrected.
Since the epsilon shapes in the aerosolmodels can be taken as the actual
spectra distribution of the aerosol scattering reflectance, the retrieved
epsilon spectra are used tomatch the two closest aerosol models for interpolation
to obtain the actual values. The 12 aerosol models are defined
as O99, M50, M70, M90, M99, C50, C70, C90, C99, T50, T90 and
T99, where the symbol O, M, C, and T refer to oceanic,maritime, coastal
and tropospheric models, respectively, and the numbers designate the
relative humidity. These models produce the epsilon spectra in the
SeaWiFS bands under different solar-sensor geometry. Normally,
these epsilon spectra are used to extrapolate the values in visible
bands depending on the selection of the aerosol models in the NIR
band. The selections are based on the match-up conditions of epsilon
between the measured values from the remote sensing data and the
modeled values. As the spectra of epsilon are obtained, they can be
used to match the two closest spectra of the aerosol models instead of
one value in the NIR band. These two aerosol models are used to
interpolate the actual epsilon values. The five spectra in Fig. 6 are used
to test this match-up method and the results are shown in Fig. 7,
superimposed on the original ones.
Fig. 7 shows that the match-up method of epsilon can significantly
modify the shape of the epsilon spectra and improve the accuracy of
the retrieved epsilon. For example, the retrieved Spectrum 3 is obviously
abnormal from the shape of epsilon and it becomes similar to
the reference one after the use of the match-up method. The relative
error of the retrieved Spectrum 3 is 12.5% and it is 2.3% for the
matched epsilon. As the satellite data are affected by many different
measured conditions, it is difficult to ensure that all reflectance are
perfect. The retrieval spectra depend on many factors; such as the
matched situation of the water-leaving reflectance between the actual
values and the look-up table, the calibration accuracy of the satellite
sensor, the Rayleigh scattering reflectance and the effects of
atmospheric absorption. In fact, some abnormal spectra similar to
Spectra in Fig. 6 are usually found in the satellite imagery. The
match-up method is useful in removing some abnormal variations
of the spectra. The results in Fig. 7 show that the matched epsilon
does follow the Angstrom law closely and fit the epsilon spectra produced
by the aerosol models. As a consequence, the accuracy of the
epsilon estimate can also be improved.
Normally, only one value of epsilon in the NIR band is used to determine
the two closest aerosol models and to extrapolate to other
values in the visible bands. However, the results depend directly on
the accuracy of the aerosol scattering reflectance in the two NIR
bands. For example, the matched epsilon value of Spectrum 3 at
Band 1 (0.412 μm) will be 7.5, 3.4 fold of the true value by the one
value matched method. The mean relative error of the spectrum is
111.1%. The variations of the five spectra at Band 1 are between
1.95 and 7.49, much higher than the results of spectra matched method
which range from 1.54 to 2.34. A small error in the reflectance will
easily lead to a bias of epsilon in the NIR band and an amplified error
in reflectance at shorter wavelengths. If the entire epsilon spectrum
instead of one value at the NIR band is used to determine the two
closest aerosol models, the results are more robust. One advantage
of the ENLF model is that it matches the two aerosol models by
matching the entire epsilon spectrum and thus improves the accuracy
of the epsilon values.
6.2. Evaluating the ENLF model using SeaWiFS imagery
The ENLF model was used to process the SeaWiFS imagery and an
example of an epsilon image in the NIR band is shown in Fig. 8. This
image is produced from the SeaWiFS data from March 27, 2007 and is
the same data used in Fig. 1. To produce this image, first, the Rayleigh
scattering reflectance was computed using a multiple scattering approach
together with the reflectance components from the ocean
whitecaps and the sun glitter off of the sea surface. The aerosol–water
reflectance was obtained from the satellite measured reflectance using
Eq. (6). Finally the aerosol scattering reflectance and the epsilon spectra
were obtained from the ENLF model
From the refined epsilon distribution in Fig. 8, we can see that the
high values of epsilon in the coastal regions are significantly reduced,
with values more closely matching to Case 1 waters. The values in the
NIR band are reduced from around 1.4 to 1.05 in the coastal regions.
To compare the differences of the epsilon spectra between Figs. 1
and 8 in detail, the whole region of the image is classified into 4 classes
according to the range of the epsilon values at Band 7 by the DPA
method. Class 1 represents the range of 1.0 to 1.1, 2 is from 1.1 to 1.2,
3 is from 1.2 to 1.3 and 4 is from 1.3 to 1.5. The epsilon spectra belonging
to the same class are averaged to obtain the mean spectra
of this class, which is shown in Fig. 9.
From Fig. 9, the mean epsilon values between the ENLF model and
the DPA method are large. The ranges of the epsilon values by the
ENLF model are from 1 to 1.7, while those by the DPA method are
from 1 to 5.7. The values by the DPA significantly increase when the
wavelengths shift from the NIR to the blue band, while those by the
ENLF keep much more stable. The spectra by the DPA are significantly
different from Classes 1 to 4, while those by the ENLF are similar.
Checking the true image (not shown in this paper) produced from
SeaWiFS data of this day, the aerosol distributions in the image are relatively
homogeneous. The epsilon values should be close to each other
among the 4 classes. As a result,we conclude that the ENLFmodel is suitable
for application in coastal regions to overcome the overestimation
problem for the epsilon.
Checking carefully the epsilon image in Fig. 8, we can see that this
image shows some information on the spatial structure of the waterleaving
reflectance. However, because the number of the waterleaving
reflectance in the look-up table is limited, there may be a small
difference between the actual water-leaving reflectance and the selected
one from the look-up table. This difference will cause a small error
in extracting epsilon. The match-up method of the ENLF model can improve
the accuracy of epsilon in different bands, but it cannot remove
the effects caused by this difference. It is important to build up a good
look-up table of thewater-leaving reflectance to cover enough actual reflectance
of the regions. It is also necessary to evaluate how the look-up
table of the reflectance affects the accuracy of the epsilon values.
6.3. Evaluating the ENLF model using in-situ measurements
The globally distributed AERONET data can be used to validate the
aerosol products derived from satellite ocean color remote sensing
data such as SeaWiFS (Mélin et al., 2010). The epsilon can be estimated
from the AOT data to validate the results from SeaWiFS data with the
ENLF model. The AOT was measured during the 2006 winter and 2007
autumncruises in the ECS using a handheldmulti-band sun photometer
(MICROTOPS)manufactured by the Solar Light Company. Two different
types ofMICROTOPS instrumentswere used. One is used tomeasure the
total ozone column, the water vapor column and the AOT at 1.020 μm.
The other measures the AOT at the five wavelengths of 0.380, 0.440,
0.500, 0.670 and 0.870 μm. A total of 17 stations during the winter
cruise and 18 stations during the autumncruisewere measured. The instrument
was connected to a GPS system to record the locations and
was used during the transit between stations, significantly increasing
the number of AOT spectra. A total of 4233 spectra were measured at
the locations shown in Fig. 2.
To compare the epsilon values between SeaWiFS and AOT, a
matched data set was assembled using a time window for the satellite
overpass of ±2 h from the in situ measurements. A total of 263
matching spectrawere obtained,withmany SeaWiFS reflectances missing
due to excessive cloud or fog cover. After applying a data quality
check, a set of 49 matched spectra was obtained under the cloud-free
condition of SeaWiFS data. The SeaWiFS reflectances were processed
to obtain the epsilon using the ENLF model and the results are shown
in Fig. 10. The AOT spectra were used to calculate the aerosol scattering
reflectance using the geometric angles of SeaWiFS, to estimate the single
scattering reflectance and finally to obtain the epsilon values which
are also shown in Fig. 10.
Fig. 10 shows that the two types of epsilon are relatively comparable.
While the magnitudes and the spectra shapes are similar to each
other, there are some important differences. Four epsilon spectra of
AOT with green color look abnormal because of their large slopes between
band 1 (0.380 μm) and band 3 (0.500 μm), which are three
times higher than the mean value. The other five spectra have the
similar characteristics, but with relatively small slopes. The slopes of
the AOT epsilon also show some difference from the SeaWiFS epsilon,
especially for the shorter wavelengths.
Because the processing of the data from AOT to epsilon is rather
complicated with several estimated parameters, the accuracy of the
AOT epsilon itself naturally exists some uncertainty. As the AOT data
of AERONET are retrieved from the ground based radiance measurements,
the data quality of AOT can also be affected by the instrument
calibration and the measurement conditions (Dubovik et al., 2000;
Smirnov et al., 2000). The translation fromAOT to the aerosol scattering
reflectance is related to the parameters of the aerosol single albedo and
its phase function, which are determined by the absorption, as well as
the type and particle size distribution of aerosols. The coefficients in
Eq. (3) are determined from the aerosol models, so they rely on different
aerosol models. These parameters were not measured and typical
values were used in the computation of epsilon from the AOT. Finally,
horizontal distributions of aerosolsmay change and a 2-hour timewindow
obviously brings some differences between SeaWiFS and in situ
measurements. Considering these inherent limitations in obtaining
both of the epsilon values, we are satisfied with the results of the comparison
of the two epsilon spectra.
7. Discussion
We find that the epsilon values resulting from satellite data strongly
depend upon the accuracy of the look-up table from the in situmeasured
reflectance. The epsilon can be estimated accurately when the look-up
table covers the actual water-leaving reflectance. Some errors are produced
by the ENLF model when only the closest reflectance is searched
out from the table with some difference between this reflectance and
the actual value. To evaluate how the table affects the accuracy of the epsilon,
a test wasmade. The test was designed to compute the accuracy of
the epsilon using different look-up tables based on different quantities of
the water-leaving reflectance. Seven tables were established including
10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 spectra from the same data set of
the in situ reflectance. The method to establish these tables is that the
spectra are randomly selected with unequal distribution, different from
that in Section 4. All reflectance were used to obtain the aerosol–water
reflectance at TOA using the simulation method in Section 6.1. The epsilon
spectra were estimated from the aerosol–water reflectance by the
ENLF model. The accuracy of the epsilon was computed on the reference
epsilon in Fig. 6 to obtain the mean relative errors shown in Fig. 11.
Fig. 11 is the result of relative errors of the epsilon from7 look-up tables.
It is clear that the errors varywidely among different tables. For example,
when the table only includes 10 spectra, most of the actual
reflectance cannot be found from the table with some large differences
fromthe selected spectra. The mean relative error of the retrieved epsilon
is 64.4%, with the maximumerror of 89% at Band 5.When the numbers
of spectra in the table increase, more actual reflectance can be
found in the table and meanwhile the difference between the actual reflectance
and the selected spectrumbecomes smaller, leading to smaller
errors. The mean relative error is 2.34% when the table includes 1000
spectra. Therefore, the accuracy of the epsilon depends on the look-up
table of the water-leaving reflectance.
The look-up table of the in situ reflectance is the basis for estimating
the epsilon fromthe satellitemeasured reflectance at the TOA using the
ENLF model. As the actual water-leaving reflectance is unknown before
the epsilon is estimated, it is determined from the look-up table with
the best nonlinear least squares fit function using the Angstrom law of
the aerosol scattering radiance. If the actual reflectance exists in the
table, the epsilon can be exactly estimated. Otherwise, a difference between
the actual reflectance and the matched spectra introduces a
bias of epsilon using the ENLF model. If the model is used in other regions,
it is important to obtain enough in situ water-leaving reflectance
data over different seasons in these regions to obtain good estimates.
The atmospheric correction over land is still difficult to establish
with high accuracy. The ENLF model provides a new practical method
to estimate the epsilon spectra for the satellite imagery over land
cover. It depends upon neither the two atmospheric correction bands
nor the dark pixel assumption. It only assumes that the aerosol scattering
reflectance follows the Angstrom law and this assumption is also
valid over land. It depends on the look-up table of in situ reflectance
to separate the aerosol scattering reflectance from the satellite measured
reflectance. The accuracy of the model depends on the distribution
of the reflectance in the look-up table. When a well designed
look-up table is established with different reflectance to represent all
land cover types in different seasons, the ENLF model can then be applied
to the atmospheric correction of satellite remote sensing data
over terrestrial regions.
8. Conclusions
Using awell designed look-up table of thewater-leaving reflectance,
the aerosol scattering reflectance can be determined using the best
non-linear least squares fit function based on the Angstromlaw. The reflectance
is then used to estimate the aerosol single scattering reflectance,
which is then used to determine the epsilon values. The ENLF
model can improve the accuracy of the atmospheric correction of satellite
remote sensing data over turbid coastal waters. The assumption of
the atmospheric correction is changed from the dark pixel assumption
to that the aerosol scattering reflectance following the Angstrom law.
As this new assumption is valid for oceanic, turbid waters and the terrestrial
regions, the ENLF model provides a new potential universal approach
of the atmospheric correction of satellite remote sensing data.
Furthermore, the two NIR atmospheric correction bands are not used
for the ENLF model, which can then be used to estimate the total
suspended matters over turbid waters.
The epsilon spectra are used to determine the two closest aerosol
models instead of relying on one epsilon value from the NIR band. The
results show that this match-up method is more robust and overcomes
the epsilon error caused by small variations of the aerosol scattering
reflectance in the two NIR bands. Meanwhile, this method can
also reduce some abnormal epsilon errors caused by factors including
the data quality of satellite measured reflectance and the mismatch of
the actual water-leaving reflectance with the spectra in the look-up
table. Further, it can also make the shape of the epsilon spectrum
more closely follow the Angstrom law.
The performance of the ENLFmodelwas evaluated by using simulated
reflectance at the TOA, SeaWiFS imagery, and in situ measured AOT
in the ECS. The results show that it can work well under the help of a
properly designed look-up table of the water-leaving reflectance. This
approach can be applied in an operational satellite remote sensing
data processing systemto improve the accuracy of the atmospheric correction
over turbid coastal regions and terrestrial environments.Title:
Defning active, inactive, and extinct sea?oor massive sulfde deposits

Author:
J.W. Jamieson, A. Gartman

Abstract
Hydrothermal activity results in the formation of hydrothermal mineral deposits, including sea?oor massive
sulfde deposits, at oceanic spreading ridges, arcs, and back-arcs. As hydrothermal systems age, the mineral
deposits eventually become severed from the heat source and ?uid-?ow pathways responsible for their formation
and become extinct. The timescales and processes by which this cessation of activity occurs, and the resultant
distinction between hydrothermally active and inactive deposits has recently taken on policy implications related
to the potential issuance of exploitation leases for sea?oor massive sulfde deposits by the International Seabed
Authority in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction. Here, we discuss the scientifc rationale behind designating
hydrothermal systems as active, inactive, or extinct, with the aim of applying a scientifc underpinning to
ongoing policy discussions, which often lack a common set of criteria and use the same descriptions for opposing
phenomena. We apply the simple defnition that active vent felds currently exhibit ?uid ?ow above ambient
seawater temperatures, inactive vent felds are not currently exhibiting ?uid ?ow but may potentially become
active again, and extinct vent felds are not expected to become active again. We suggest these terms can only be
correctly applied at the vent feld scale and defne a vent feld as a geologically continuous entity that may
include both actively and formerly venting hydrothermal deposits. Finally, we propose criteria and techniques
for determining activity and reasonably bounding the extent of a vent feld for classifcation purposes.

Introduction
Hydrothermal vents are sites of ?uid discharge on the sea?oor that
occur along or associated with submarine tectonic boundaries such as
mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones. In these geological settings,
magmatic heat sources beneath the sea?oor drive convective circulation
of hydrothermal ?uids along permeable pathways in the crust such as
faults and fssures (Fig. 1) [1]. If the hydrothermal vents are discharging
high-temperature (>~250 ?C), metal- and sulfur-rich ?uids, a sea?oor
massive sulfde (SMS) deposit may develop over time on and/or
immediately below the sea?oor from the precipitation and accumulation of metal-rich minerals that precipitate from the ?uid when it mixes
with cold seawater [1,2]. In rare places, where these
geologically-favorable conditions persist for an extended period of time,
these deposits can grow to be large enough and contain high enough
concentrations of Cu, Zn, Au, and/or Ag to be potentially economically
viable sources for these metals and targets for the emergent industry of
deep-seabed mining [3,4]. Eventually, hydrothermal ?uid venting at
any given site will cease, and the site will become hydrothermally
inactive and ultimately extinct. Currently, very little information is
available for inactive or extinct SMS deposits. InterRidge maintains an
online ※Vents Database§ of all known and inferred hydrothermal systems discovered to date [5]. The current version (v. 3.4) contains 707
individual records of ※submarine hydrothermal activity§, with only 54
of these records listed as ※inactive§. The paucity of documented inactive
sites is largely because inactive deposits are diffcult to fnd as they do
not have an associated hydrothermal plume, the detection of which is
the primary exploration tool for SMS deposits [6]. The scientifc focus on
active hydrothermal vent sites, which host unique chemosynthetic taxa
and which are locations of scientifc interest beyond the economic interest driving SMS exploration further contributes to the low number of
known inactive sites [7每9]. However, there is an increasing focus on
inactive SMS deposits driven by the possibility of marine mining.
In Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ), any mining of SMS
deposits (also referred to as polymetallic sulfde deposits) will be
managed by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). As the ISA moves
closer toward fnalizing exploitation regulations for mining in ABNJ,
discussion of environmental considerations, including what
environmental protections are needed, has been a key component. A ban
on mining of active SMS deposits has been suggested by parts of the
scientifc community, due to the minimal areas of the sea?oor these
vents occupy, their scientifc value, and low estimations of their resource
potential [10每12]. This has been followed by assertions that mining of
active hydrothermal vents would likely take place in a limited manner, if
at all, and that inactive deposits will be the main target of this emergent
industry [13]. However, all current ISA exploration contracts include
areas of active hydrothermal venting and, while only a fraction of each
10,000 km2 exploration area will be subject to exploitation, a workable
defnition for active hydrothermal vents in a manner that could be legally applicable for mining regulations does not currently exist. Here we
propose a classifcation similar to that used for volcanoes, which uses the
designations active, inactive (dormant), and extinct. We consider how this
classifcation can be reasonably applied to hydrothermal systems and
associated SMS deposits, in order to ensure a consistent and meaningful
geologic framework for the evolving regulations. Known active hydrothermal systems are diverse, and many do not result in SMS formation.
Here we discuss those associated with high-temperature sub-sea?oor
?uid circulation that has the potential to mobilize and deposit base and
precious metals as sulfde minerals (e.g., temperatures above 250 ?C)
[14]. We specifcally do not include systems that would not result in SMS
formation, and so exclude low-temperature, low-?ux systems associated
with off-axis areas and seamounts.

Method
2. Terminology
For clarity, we use the following terminology when referencing hydrothermal mineral accumulations on the sea?oor at different scales
(Table 1). Focused sources of high temperature hydrothermal venting
typically emanate from chimneys, or individual, in places interlinked,
vertical pipe-like mineral accumulations that have one or more orifces.
Hydrothermal edifces or mounds are larger structures that form from the
progressive accumulation of hydrothermal material on the sea?oor at
vent sites. Edifces and mounds are defned by their morphology, with
edifces generally having steeper sides, and mounds having a distinct
conical shape. Both structures may host chimneys. The spatial clustering
of chimneys, edifces, and/or mounds on the sea?oor defne a vent feld,
which describes a discrete region that contains hydrothermal accumulations distributed over an area with dimensions that can vary from 10s
to 1,000s of meters (Table 1).
When referring to sea?oor hydrothermal deposits as a resource, we
use well-established language typically used by the land-based mineral
resource sector (Table 2) [15]. If a sea?oor hydrothermal site contains a
spatially continuous accumulation of hydrothermal material of large
enough size to be potentially mineable (i.e. a large edifce or mound), it
is referred to as a deposit (e.g., the Solwara I deposit, in the Manus Basin)
[16,17]. An SMS deposit refers to a subset of hydrothermal deposits that
is composed dominantly of metal sulfde minerals (e.g., pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite; note that the term massive in sea?oor massive sulfde is
a mineralogical textural term to indicate a mass abundance of sulfde
minerals of >~60% and is not a reference to deposit size) [18]. Therefore, the term SMS deposit should be applied only to large accumulations
of hydrothermal minerals (deposits) that are known from sampling or
other methods to be composed largely of massive sulfde material. In
other words, although every SMS deposit is a hydrothermal deposit, not
every hydrothermal deposit is necessarily an SMS deposit. Petersen et al.
[4] estimated that, at probable minimum ore grades (e.g., ~5 wt% Cu,
15 wt% Zn, 5 ppm Au), an SMS deposit would have to be at least 2 Mt to
be an economically viable target for mining. This would correspond to a
massive sulfde mound with a basal diameter of approximately 200 m
and height of 60 m, similar to the active TAG mound [19]. Using these
defnitions, a vent feld may contain no deposits, a single deposit, or
several deposits, some or all of which may or may not be SMS deposits.
Volcanoes are informally classifed as active, dormant, or extinct, where
an active volcano has erupted in the past ~10,000 years, a dormant
volcano has not erupted in the past 10,000 years, but is expected to erupt
again, and an extinct volcano has not erupted in the past 10,000 years,
and is not expected to erupt again [20]. This classifcation can serve as a
guide for the activity of vents felds, where active felds will contain
hydrothermal venting at temperatures above ambient seawater, inactive
vent felds lack apparent activity but were recently active, remain near a
heat source, and have the potential to become active again, and venting
is unlikely to resume at extinct vent felds. The classifcation of a volcano
as dormant, rather than extinct, is normally due to the presence of indicators of heat and/or magmatic activity in the subsurface, such as
seismic events within the volcano, elevated heat ?ow, or presence of
fumaroles. Several examples of the eruption of an ※extinct§ volcano (eg., Fourpeaked Volcano, Alaska) point to the lack of certainty associated
with this informal classifcation, associated with an evolving understanding regarding deep-Earth processes. Likewise, the classifcation of a
vent feld as extinct should not be considered an absolute certainty, but
instead a low probability that hydrothermal venting will reactivate in
the future.

3. Indicators of hydrothermal activity
Defning an individual hydrothermal vent, deposit or vent feld as
active is conceptually simple enough: it is hydrothermally active when
?uid with a temperature above that of ambient bottom water is venting
from the sea?oor. Hydrothermal plume surveys use CTD (Conductivity,
Temperature and Depth) casts that also include optical sensors
(turbidity) and sensors for chemical anomalies (e.g., salinity, Eh, CH4)
associated with the hydrothermal plume in the water column above and
down-current from an active vent site, at distances of up to 100s of kilometers away from their source [6]. Collecting seawater on CTD casts
also allows for the detection of 3He, an unambiguous tracer of hydrothermal activity. Once a plume is detected, the hydrothermal site is
typically visually located using a camera tow or cameras on a Remotely
Operated Vehicle (ROV) or Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).
Visual signs of venting may be obvious, with vigorous discharge of
high-temperature black or white smoker ?uid, often from multiple vents
(Fig. 2A). Subsurface mixing of ascending hydrothermal ?uid with local
seawater prior to venting also typically occurs, and results in cooler,
diffuse-?ow ?uids that may be shimmering due to temperature and
salinity differences relative to seawater. Both ※focused ?ow§ and
※diffuse ?ow§ styles comprise active hydrothermal venting.
Even when venting is not visibly obvious, the presence of live hydrothermal vent-endemic species is another clear indicator of active
venting. Vent biota have a tendency to colonize even the most diffusely
venting, low-temperature sites, and, due to the vivid colors these organisms may display against a dull sea?oor substrate, can be a particularly effective indicator of hydrothermal activity when ?uid ?uxes
and/or venting temperatures are low (Fig. 2B).
On sites that have been sampled by dredge and therefore lack visual
information regarding sea?oor context, the presence of anhydride
(CaSO4) can be used as a mineralogical indicator of recent hightemperature hydrothermal activity and indicates that the site may still
be active. Anhydrite precipitates when Ca-rich hydrothermal ?uids mix
with and/or heats up Ca- and SO4-rich seawater at temperatures of
above ~150 ?C [21]. However, anhydride has retrograde solubility, and
will dissolve back into seawater when it is no longer exposed to elevated
temperatures. The rate of anhydride dissolution is not well constrained,
and it is therefore not known for how long anhydride remains as a
mineral phase within cold vent deposits. However, surfcial areas of old,
inactive or extinct deposits will not contain anhydride, although it may
remain in areas not in contact with seawater (e.g., at depth) as it is found
occasionally in volcanogenic massive sulfde deposits (VMS, i.e. the
ancient equivalent of SMS deposits) [22].
4. Indicators of hydrothermal inactivity
There are several sea?oor observations that indicate prolonged hydrothermal inactivity at a deposit or vent feld and can therefore be
important criteria for distinguishing inactive sites from extinct sites.
Over long time periods (e.g., 1000s of years) it is likely that inactive
chimneys will eventually collapse. The oldest known vent felds (e.g.,
>40,000 years old) are characterized by a notable lack of upright
chimney structures, and instead are composed primarily of low-relief
mounds (e.g., Peterburgskoe and Semyenov IV on the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge) [23每25]. Chimney collapse occurs due to increasing structural
instability as chimneys grow taller, the dissolution of thermodynamically unstable minerals in seawater, and because most hydrothermal
systems occur in seismically active areas where ground motion can lead
to collapse. However, timescales for chimney collapse may vary for
different deposits according to tectonic and oceanographic setting (i.e.
intensity and frequency of seismic activity; temperature and dissolved
oxygen content in bottom waters), and the mineralogy and morphology
of the deposits.
Oxidation of sulfde minerals within hydrothermal deposits indicates
exposure to seawater. Oxidation begins as soon as the minerals are in
contact with oxygenated seawater and thus oxidation occurs even during periods of active venting. Likewise, the dissolution of anhydride
begins once the precipitated mineral is no longer hot, and therefore
dissolution can occur on cooler parts of otherwise high-temperature vent
structures. Prolonged periods of exposure to ambient, low temperature
seawater can lead to substantial oxidation of sulfde minerals and anhydride dissolution, and both processes may be considered qualitative
indicators of deposit aging, with the important caveat that these transformations do not a priori indicate inactivity. However, over long time
periods loss of these minerals may fundamentally reshape hydrothermal
deposits.
Inactive vents display an absence of chemosynthetic fauna and, if
they have been inactive for long enough, will often host deep-sea slow
growing sessile taxa such as sponges and corals (Fig. 2C). For a more
detailed description of biological indications of activity and inactivity
see Van Dover [26].
When applied independently, the indicators of inactivity described
above (lack of upright chimneys, extensive oxidation, and lack of vent
biological communities) may not necessarily be diagnostic for classifcation of inactivity on their own. However, taken together, these observations provide a reliable, unambiguous indication of prolonged
hydrothermal inactivity.
5. Defning hydrothermal activity at the vent feld scale
Although hydrothermal inactivity may be described at the scale of
individual vents or deposits using the criteria in the preceding section,
defning a vent feld as active, inactive, or extinct is much more complex
because we do not yet fully understand the spatial scale of hydrothermal
circulation cells in the sub-sea?oor. A vent feld is generally described as
a cluster of hydrothermal vents or deposits on the sea?oor. The size,
morphology, and distribution of hydrothermal deposits that make up a
vent feld can vary signifcantly, largely according to tectonic environment, making a simple defnition based on deposit size or footprint
impractical [2]. We use the concept of geological connectivity to defne
the extents of individual vent felds based on a common magmatic heat
source and subsea?oor permeability structure, such as normal faults or
detachment faults associated with rifting along mid-ocean ridges, or ring
faults associated with caldera collapse within arc volcanoes [27每29].
Using this defnition, any spatially associated currently or formerly
active vent sites and associated chimneys, edifces and/or mounds that
are geologically connected would be considered part of a single vent
feld. Each vent feld would be subject to a single classifcation of activity
that would apply to the entire feld, and any active vent feld may
contain more than one hydrothermal circulation cell. The evaluation of
geological connectivity at a specifc site would be possible by interpretation of geological features on the sea?oor (e.g., faults, volcanic centers) identifed through ship-based and high-resolution bathymetric
mapping (e.g., ~40 m and 1 m resolution, respectively). These datasets
would commonly be generated as part of any exploration and resource
evaluation program.
The Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca mid-ocean ridge provides an illustrative example of defning the limits of individual vent
felds using the concept of geological connectivity. The Endeavour
Segment is described as containing fve major active vent felds that
occur along 15 km of the ridge axial valley, each separated by 1.5每2 km,
with several smaller felds, and other sites of diffuse venting occurring
near or between the major active felds (Fig. 3A) [30]. However, this
current clustering of active venting represents only a present-day
snapshot of the evolution of hydrothermal circulation along this 15 km
length of ridge segment. This stretch of ridge axis also contains over 400
inactive chimneys, edifces and mounds that occur outside of the active
vent felds and record over 3000 years of spatially and temporally dynamic venting at Endeavour (Fig. 3A) [31,32]. Seismic imaging along
the ridge axis reveals that this venting was, and continues to be, driven
by a continuous axial magma chamber beneath the ridge segment [33].
The vents occur in close proximity to the along-axis normal faults that
defne the axial valley and are likely an important control on subsurface
permeability and hydrothermal ?uid ?ow. Thus, although the active
vent clusters each likely represent currently discrete hydrothermal circulation cells, the entire 15 km length of axial valley represents a
geologically continuous zone of present or recent hydrothermal venting,
driven by a common heat source and structurally controlled permeability regime. Endeavour should therefore be considered as a single
continuous vent feld, and, consequently, since parts of Endeavour are
hydrothermally active, the entire 15 km long vent feld should be
considered active.
The fve Semyenov vent felds associated with the 13?30＊ oceanic
core complex on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge provide a contrasting example
to Endeavour. Semyenov 1-5 are roughly equally spaced along the axis
of the core complex (Fig. 3B) [34]. Apart from Semyenov 3 and 5, which
are closely spaced and are geologically similar, these vent felds have
different morphologies, compositions, and local tectonic controls and
substrates. All vent felds are separated by stretches of substrate that
show no indication of past hydrothermal activity. Here, it is appropriate
that each vent feld be considered as separate from the others, and
individually classifed as active, inactive, or extinct, as there is no
indication of geological continuity between the fve Semyenov felds
(again, except for Semyenov 3 and 5, which should be grouped
together). Based on extensive plume surveys and several ROV dives,
only Semyenov 2 is known to be active, and Semyenov 1, 3, 4, and 5
appear to be extinct [35,36].
The TAG hydrothermal feld presents a more challenging case study.
The hydrothermal mounds that defne the TAG feld are distributed over
a ~8 km2 area on the eastern edge of the axial valley (Fig. 3C) [38].
Some of the mounds coalesce with adjacent mounds (e.g. Double
Mound) or are directly next to each other (e.g., Shinkai Mound and New
Mounds #2 and #3; Southern Mound and Rona Mound). Other mounds
appear to be isolated deposits more than a kilometer away from other
known mounds (e.g., Mir Zone, active TAG Mound, and Shimmering
Mound). The TAG feld has been used as a case study for the exploration
for inactive deposits and understanding their physical and chemical
evolution [37]. With the exception of the active mound, which is
vigorously venting black smoker ?uids, the mounds display characteristics of inactive deposits, including lack of venting or vent-related
macrofauna, partial burial by sediments, paucity of upright chimney
structures, partial dismemberment by faulting, and internal collapse,
and Southern, Shinkai, and New Mounds have been described as ※eSMS§
(extinct SMS) [37]. However, at Southern Mound, the presence of bacterial mats suggests that diffuse, low-temperature venting is occurring
(Fig. 2B). The Shinkai and New Mounds lack evidence of bacterial mats,
but host abundant upright chimney spires and do not display internal
collapse features that characterize many of the other mounds. The lack
of collapse features is interpreted to indicate that anhydride dissolution
has yet to occur and heat is still retained within these mounds, suggesting that these mounds have only recently become inactive [37].
Radioisotope dating of hydrothermal precipitates indicate that large
deposits form on the order of 1,000s to 100,000 s years [32,39每41].
Evidence from radioisotope dating of the active mound at TAG indicates
that hydrothermal activity is cyclical, with prolonged periods of activity
and inactivity [39], suggesting that, using the defnitions proposed here,
Shinkai and New Mounds may not be extinct but only currently inactive,
whereas Southern Mound appears to be active. Overall, the cluster of
mounds that defne the TAG feld are interpreted to have formed
through hydrothermal circulation driven by a common ridge axis heat
source and channeling of ?uid along a common subsea?oor detachment
fault system [42,43]. Based on this interpretation, the entire vent feld
should therefore be classifed as hydrothermally active, as the individual
mounds are linked by the same underlying hydrothermal permeability
structure.
The examples from Endeavour and TAG provide evidence that,
although individual chimneys can in places be stable on decadal timescales, this is not universally true, and hydrothermal venting can be
spatially variable over the lifespan of a vent feld. Results from deepdrilling projects reveal that, in some places, drilling into the sea?oor
adjacent to an active black smoker does not intersect the system and
results in no change to ?uid ?ow in the active smoker. Drilling by ODP
leg 169 at Escanaba Trough, a sediment covered spreading center,
resulted in no intersection of hydrothermal ?ow nor changes to the
adjacent active vent, less than 10 m from the drill site (Fig. 4A) [45,46].
In other places, however, drilling resulted in the creation of a new black
smoker. In the Iheya North hydrothermal feld, in the Okinawa Trough,
for example, drilling adjacent to active hydrothermal vents during IODP
Expedition 331 resulted in the formation of artifcial, active hydrothermal vents, some of which persisted for more than 40 months and
resulted in rapid hydrothermal chimney growth (Fig. 4B) [47]. Similar
creation of artifcial hydrothermal vents and associated chimneys were
also reported during ODP Legs 139 and 169 at Middle Valley on the Juan
de Fuca (Fig. 4C) [48,49]. At Iheya North, the ?uids discharging from
these artifcial vents were higher salinity than those forming the natural
hydrothermal vents in the region prior to drilling, as a result of segregation of high and low salinity ?uids in the subsea?oor, with only low
salinity ?uids venting in the absence of drilling [50]. This demonstrates
that sea?oor penetration in an active region may release not only ?uids
that are currently venting in other parts of the vent feld but may connect
with existing subsurface ?uid reservoirs that are currently not venting.
Given our current understanding of subsurface ?uid ?ow, the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of hydrothermal systems indicates that drilling
into an inactive deposit in an overall active vent feld has the potential to
initiate ?uid ?ow.
6. Global inventory of inactive SMS deposits
The InterRidge Vents Database is a researcher-driven compilation
that aims to provide an international standard for documentation of all
sites of submarine hydrothermal activity and includes both hightemperature ※black smoker§ ore-forming systems discussed here, and
low-temperature systems associated with seamounts and fracture zones.
Only 8% of the sites documented in the InterRidge database are classifed as inactive [5]. Of the 54 sites classifed as inactive, 36 are
low-temperature systems that occur on seamounts (e.g., Brown Bear
Seamount; Dellwood Seamount), Fe- or Mn-oxide deposits (e.g., Carlsberg Ridge, 1.67 S; Shikurose Bank), or disseminated sulfdes in quartz
veins in exposed crustal rocks (e.g., DSDP Hole 504B; Vema Fracture
Zone) and are not considered high-temperature, ore-forming systems
comparable to systems that could generate an SMS deposit and so are not
considered here. Of the remaining 19 ※inactive§ sites, one site
(Zenith-Victory, Mid-Atlantic Ridge) should be classifed as active due to
a report of a hydrothermal plume at this location [23]. Another ※inactive§ site from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Ashadze 4, is also not considered
because the only published description of this site is a report of an
inactive sulfde boulder with a maximum dimension of about 1 m that
was observed and sampled during an ROV transect ~1.5 km downslope
from the active Ashadze 1 feld [52,53]. There are two sites classifed as
※inactive§ for which we judge there to be not enough information for
activity to be considered: the 24?N 30＊ site on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge;
and the site on the EPR 14 N Seamount that was discovered and sampled
by a single dredge that recovered hydrothermal material [54]. Finally,
there is a record for an inactive site at Mata Nima in the Lau Basin;
however, no published record of hydrothermal vents, either active or
inactive, can be found for this specifc volcano.
Among the list of ※active§ sites in the InterRidge database are also
sites that are known to be inactive. The Petersburgskoe site (MidAtlantic Ridge) is listed as ※Active, inferred§, but no indications of activity at this feld have been reported [23]. Also, ※Semyenov§ (Mid--
Atlantic Ridge) is listed as a single record, yet as discussed above,
represents a grouping of 5 vent felds, with Semyenov 2 the only active
feld. We know of two other inactive sites (Surprise and Yubileinoe,
Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Bel＊tenev et al., 2017) that are not yet listed in the
database [55].
We therefore identify only 20 sites in the global InterRidge database
that should be considered inactive using the criteria described above
(Table 3). A detailed examination of all 707 records would be required
to evaluate whether other potentially inactive sites are hidden or not
individually listed in this dataset. However, from this initial analysis, the
documented inventory of inactive deposits is very low, and points to 1)
how little information we have on inactive deposits, including inactive
SMS deposits; and 2) the need to improve our ability to locate inactive
deposits.
Within the current inventory of inactive deposits that formed along
mid-ocean ridges (i.e. excluding deposits that formed on seamounts) all
occur within or on the ?anks of the ridge axial valley (i.e. on-axis), which
represents the neovolcanic zone, which can be tens of kilometers wide,
and is associated with the locus of volcanic and hydrothermal activity
along mid-ocean ridges [3]. For example, the Petersburgskoe deposit on
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is located on the western wall of the axial valley,
16 km from the ridge axis [23]; Lost City, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is
14 km from the ridge axis [8]; and the Penumbra deposit on the Central
Indian Ridge is 14 km from the ridge axis [50]. As sea?oor spreading
continues, deposits that form on-axis will eventually migrate off-axis,
and away from the heat source that drives the hydrothermal circulation. Off-axis deposits are therefore likely extinct, and attractive
exploration targets for contractors. In fact, since all oceanic crust formed
at mid-ocean ridges, the entire ocean basins may be prospective for
extinct SMS deposits. The preservation of such deposits, which is likely
controlled by the interplay of sulfde oxidation rates and burial by
sediment or lava, will be a major factor in understanding the off-axis
resource potential, although the abundance of VMS found in abducted
oceanic terrains on land indicates that at least some fraction of these
deposits is preserved.


Conclusions and implications for mining and exploration

The classifcation of hydrothermal activity, inactivity, and extinction
that we defne here is simple and geologically concise. Defning the
extent of hydrothermal vent felds, which is necessary for delimiting the
boundary to which a classifcation of activity would apply, however,
presents a greater challenge. For the purposes of defning hydrothermal
activity in relation to mining activities, it is important to note that,
although mining will occur at the deposit scale, the geological connectivity that defnes a vent feld necessitates that the criteria used to
classify the state of activity must extend beyond the limits of the deposit
itself and be considered at the vent feld scale. If an inactive deposit
occurs within a vent feld that is hydrothermally active (i.e. any regions
within the feld show evidence of activity or recently activity), the
overall feld must still be hydrothermally connected to its heat source,
and all deposits within the feld have the potential to resume activity.
Therefore, deposits within an active vent feld may be described as
active or inactive, with the caveat that inactive sections of an active vent
feld may be expected to resume activity; and the classifcation of any
deposit as extinct requires that the entire vent feld be inactive and not
geologically connected to any active venting. It is expected that any
extinct hydrothermal feld would satisfy the following three criteria: 1)
absence of ?uid discharge from the sea?oor at temperatures above that
of ambient bottom water; 2) a lack upright chimneys; 3) extensive
oxidation of hydrothermal material; and 4) absence of live vent-?uid
dependent biological communities.
Although designating areas or individual deposits within an overall
active system as ※active§ or ※inactive§ may be biologically relevant over
observed timescales, this approach lacks a connection to subsea?oor
processes and the validity of these designations may not persist when the
subsea?oor is disturbed by both natural events (e.g., magmatic or
tectonic activity) and human modifcations (drilling, mining). This
emphasizes that such designations must take place at the vent feld scale.
Our simple defnition avoids ambiguities associated with other potential criteria for activity classifcation that would rely on continuous,
non-discrete attributes such as vent ?uid temperature or ?ow rates, and
is consistent with an understanding of hydrothermal activity that at the
primary level is defned by the presence of hydrothermal ?uid ?ow. In
the absence of a detailed sub-sea?oor understanding of the plumbing of
hydrothermal systems, including the dynamism of reservoirs, surface
parameters are described that can indicate cessation of hydrothermal
activity at the vent-feld scale, including the lack of a hydrothermal
plume and the absence of upright chimneys; as well as geological parameters that can be used to consider the extent of a vent feld and
differentiate geologically discrete felds on a ridge segment. Generally,
felds on faster spreading segments exhibit more dynamic variability and
felds on slow spreading ridges may be stable over thousands of years.
However, indicators that hydrothermal activity can cease and restart,
with hiatus lasting between less than one and several thousands of years,
as well as begin in ※inactive§ regions of an active feld as a result of
drilling, demonstrate that we should label entire hydrothermal felds
extinct with caution.
The implication of this binary geologic defnition of activity is that,
in the vast majority of cases where mineral exploration is occurring,
both within EEZs and Areas Beyond National Jurisdictions, the main
area of interest is an active hydrothermal feld. However, the small
number of known inactive deposits does not necessary re?ect a low
resource potential for inactive SMS deposits. Instead, it highlights our
only cursory understanding of the distribution, preservation and ability
to explore for these deposits. This provides abundant motivation for
further research into the processes of SMS formation from hydrothermal
?uids and reinforces the need to continue to explore the ocean basins,
especially further away from the ridge crest.

Detecting changes in high-resolution satellite
coastal imagery using an image object detection
approach
This article presents a spatial contrast-enhanced image object-based change detection
approach (SICA) to identify changed areas using shape differences between bi-temporal
high-resolution satellite images. Each image was segmented and intrinsic image objects
were extracted from their hierarchic candidates by the proposed image object detection
approach (IODA). Then, the dominant image object (DIO) presentation was labelled
from the results of optimal segmentation. Comparing the form and the distribution of
bi-temporal DIOs by using the raster overlay function, ground objects were recognized
as being spatially changed where the corresponding image objects were detected as
merged or split into geometric shapes. The result of typical spectrum-based change
detection between two images was enhanced by using changed spatial information of
image objects. The result showed that the change detection accuracies of the pixels
with both attribute and shape changes were improved from 84% to 94% for the strong
attribute pixel, and from 36% to 81% for the weak attribute pixel in study area. The
proposed approach worked well on high-resolution satellite coastal images.
1. Introduction
Remote-sensing change detection is the process of identifying differences in the state of an
object or phenomenon by observing it at different times (Singh 1989). It is one of the most
important applications for analysing multitemporal remotely sensed images. Change detection
is also a meaningful tool for monitoring and managing natural resources and urban
development in a coastal zone because it can quantitatively measure the spatial variation
of relevant ground objects during a given period (Malthus 2003; Bontemps et al. 2008).
Furthermore, a shape-based approach has been introduced to change detection (Li and
Narayanan 2003). However, the most common approach has been to classify each image
pixel as an independent observation regardless of its spatial context (Marcal et al. 2005).
Unfortunately, this is fraught with the limitations imposed by pixel-based image analysis.
With the increasing spatial resolution of remotely sensed imagery, new applications in
coastal zones require the generation of change detection maps characterized by both a high
geometric resolution and the capability of properly modelling the complex areas present in
the scene (Bovolo 2009).
Remote sensing has made enormous progress over the last few years from what has
been predominantly a per-pixel, multispectral (MS)-based approach to the development and
application of multiscale object-based methods (Hay et al. 2005). Blaschke (2010) gave an
overview of the development of object-based methods. Recently, the development of geographic
object-based image analysis (GEOBIA or OBIA) has nevertheless provided a new,
critical bridge between the spatial concepts applied in multiscale landscape analysis. In the
segmentation process, natural complexity can be effectively explored using spatial analysis
tools based on the concept that landscapes are process continuums which can be partially
decomposed into objects or patches (Burnett and Blaschke 2003). Walter (2004) adopted
object-based classification and a geographical information system (GIS) to improve the
capability of change detection. Desclée, Bogaert, and Defourny (2006) detected forest landcover
change using a statistic object-based method. Yu et al. (2006) found that using objects
as minimum classification units helped overcome the problem of salt-and-pepper effects
resulting from pixel-based classification methods. Tian and Chen (2007) proposed a framework
to find optimal segmentations for a given feature type using an image object-based
method. Object-based applications have been performed for mapping and change analysis
in mangrove ecosystems (Conchedda, Durieux, and Mayaux 2008) and in urban sprawl
areas (Durieux, Lagabrielle, and Nelson 2008). Im, Jensen, and Tullist (2008) introduced a
change detection method based on object/neighbourhood correlation by image analysis and
image segmentation techniques. Some unsupervised approaches have been presented based
on the comparison between features computed on homogeneous regions that are obtained
according to segmentation procedures (Hall and Hay 2003; Bruzzone and Carlin 2006).
Even if these object-based change detection methods are implicitly suitable to analyse highresolution
images, they get the final change detection by pixel-to-pixel comparison, which
is not an effective region descriptor like object-to-object comparison. Partly, this is because
most of these techniques do not generate explicit object topology, nor even incorporate the
concept of an object within their analysis (Hay et al. 2003).
The relatively homogeneous and semantically significant groups of pixels produced
after multiscale segmentation have been designated ‘object candidates’, which are to be recognized
by further processing steps and to be transferred into meaningful objects (Burnett
and Blaschke 2003). Considering the oversegmentation or the undersegmentation problem,
there exists a large matching gap between the theoretically hierarchical network of image
object candidates and real-world objects of a landscape. In many cases, the delineation of
relatively homogeneous areas is the basic method, and the common denominator of various
realizations of image object-based change detection is the objective to derive meaningful
objects. Moreover, the dominant landscape objects have their intrinsic scales and are composed
of structurally connected parts. In this article, the image object detection approach
(IODA) (Chen, Pan, and Mao 2006, 2009) is adopted to choose appropriate scales and
produce meaningful image objects from any possible image candidates, and to distinguish
intrinsic scale from any segmentation scale. The newly developed method is also an update
to the work presented in Chen, Pan, and Mao (2009) by the same authors.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Related work
Multiscale segmentation is a procedure by which an image is precisely separated into mutually
exclusive region sets by computing the defined heterogeneity. The criteria for stopping
the segmentation procedure are the degree of difference between two regions. These differences
are optimized in a heuristic process by comparing the attributes of the regions
(Baatz and Schäpe 2000). Only one segmentation scale was set as the criterion in the segmentation
procedure. As may be known, there are various optimal segmentation scales
with respect to diverse intrinsic scales of ground objects in remotely sensed images. So,
the IODA method chooses the meaningful object candidates as image objects from whole
multiscale representations (Chen, Pan, and Mao 2009).
In the IODA, for MS remotely sensed images, the spectral mean distance (SMD) was
defined commonly to describe the distance of two adjacent candidates using their spectral
mean values, μd and μ d, for spectral band d:
The combined standard deviation (CSD) which characterizes the homogeneity for each
candidate can be defined as follows:
where wd is the user-defined weight for spectral band d, and σd is its standard deviation of
candidate a. Here, the difference distinctive feature (DDF) was defined as follows:
where the DDF of candidate a is determined by the SMD and the standard deviation. The
minimum DDF (MD) is used in the measurement of the distinguishability of an object
candidate against its surrounded candidates at one segmentation scale:
In the segmentation procedure, the pixel p belongs to a series of object candidates, along
with the increasing of scale s. Each candidate has its minimum distinctive, which makes up
the MD curve. The maximum distinctive feature (MDF) is defined as the maximum MD
from the initial scale to a given scale in the MD curve. The scale order is constructed by a
series of the original scale of ordinal MDF. For a simple object, the original scale at which
its meaningful image object formed must be in scale order, and this can be adopted as the
segmentation scale at the intrinsic scale (Chen, Pan, and Mao 2009).
2.2. Image object-based spatial change detection
The proposed approach was dependent on the homogeneous image objects yielded from
the IODA method (see Figure 1), which was based on the multiscale segmentation result;
scale order sequences for each pixel were then established. Subsequently, the nonsignificant
candidates were removed and the potential image objects in the MDF object candidate set
were retrieved from multiscale representations. As described above, the image object identification
here was making heterogeneity of inter-neighbourhood image objects maximized
as well as the homogeneity of intra-image object individually.
According to the provocative question that Blaschke and Strobl (2001) raised, ‘What’s
wrong with pixels?’, an increasing dissatisfaction was identified with pixel-by-pixel image
analysis. Under the assumption that the landscape of interest is a finite population of objects
(Bian 2007), the spatial information about these objects is integrated in the ultimate change
detection method. Considering the Shannon sampling theorem, we expected that an object
should be of the order of one-tenth of the dimension of the sampling scheme – the pixel –
in order to ensure that it would be completely independent of its random position and its
orientation relative to the sampling scheme (Blaschke 2010). Accordingly, image objects
larger than twice or three times the minimum needed by Shannon’s sampling theorem and
the pixels satisfying 3 × 3 pixels distribution were focused mainly in the application. These
image objects are called dominant image objects (DIOs). Spatial information of these DIOs
are included in the following image object-based change detection procedure.
The workflow of the image object-based change detection algorithm is shown in
Figure 2. Two temporal remotely sensed images were geo-corrected using in image registration
mutually in image preprocessing. At the second stage, two parallel processes were
performed for traditional change detection based on spectral information and image objectbased
spatial contrast-enhanced change detection, respectively. In the latter approach, both
images were segmented using the IODA. Then, the DIO presentation was identified from
the product of optimal segmentation and labelled with a unique reference number. Next, two
DIO sets from bi-temporal images were compared by the raster overlay function by using
their unique reference numbers. The corresponding image objects were recorded as shape
changed when they were detected as merged or split in the overlay function. Concurrently
the typical change detection approach was performed through calculating the image objectbased
average spectral data. At the third stage, the difference map that was created based
on object-to-object comparison with the change of shape as a result was integrated into the
result of traditional detected change using the spectral approach. Finally, the change map
was produced by enhancement of the spatial information of the image object.
The overlay function was executed by taking each DIO as a raster zone by using a
unique reference number. The image objects from two temporal images which merged or
split were divided into small parts in the overlay function. If the DIO from the former
image contained or intersected with more than one latter DIO and the intersected parts also
met the condition of DIO, we considered the situation as the split procedure of the former
image object.When the image object from the latter image contained or intersected with the
former DIOs, their intersected parts were taken as the DIO, and the merged state occurred.
Admittedly, there were both merging and splitting procedures when we compared with the
image objects from two temporal images. The merged or split state means that the change
of shape has occurred.
2.3. Integration of spectral and spatial information
Shape change means some or all parts of ground objects are changed. Other information
is also required for identification of the changed parts or for other regions where the
shape is not changed. Change detection algorithms in the remote-sensing literature can be
roughly divided into two categories (Yuan and Elvidge 1998; Mas 1999): preclassification
and postclassification change detection. Image object-based change detection adopting a
strategy of postclassification takes three steps: segmentation, classification, and comparison.
Such high-resolution imagery presents a new class of change detection problems to
which existing remote-sensing techniques are not well suited. Classification techniques for
thematic labelling, based on spectral and textural attributes, cannot describe within-class
changes like new construction in cities, since the area is classified as urban before and after
such changes (Pollard et al. 2010). This meant that most were detected as changed areas
because of misclassification. In our approach, the segmented results were classified using
the supervised maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) method. The MLC is the most common
supervised classification method used with remote-sensing image data and is based
on the Bayesian probability theory (Richards 1995). Then, the overall accuracy, the kappa
coefficient, producer’s accuracy, and user’s accuracy were calculated for each class. For
illustrating the performance of spatial change detection, the classes were divided into two
groups: high accuracy classes (above the overall accuracy) and low accuracy classes (below
the overall accuracy) in the case study. Therefore, the former classes were called obvious
classes and the latter classes were called unobvious classes. When the change happened,
the change among obvious classes or between obvious classes and unobvious classes was
assumed as a strong attribute pixel change. Only the change among the unobvious classes
was assumed as a weak attribute pixel change. Then, the strong or weak attribute pixel
change was enhanced by a shape changed result derived from DIOs. Therefore, the detected
results were divided into strong attribute pixel and shape change, strong attribute pixel
change only, weak attribute pixel and shape change, and weak attribute pixel change only.
2.4. Study site and data
Two high-resolution satellite images covering the same area were used in this study, which
were both 1024 × 1024 pixel subimages of an IKONOS scene (see Figure 3). The area represents
a portion of the highly fragmented agro-waterfront landscape. IKONOS provides
16-bit MS data in blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) channels at 4 m spatial resolution
and a 16-bit panchromatic (PAN) channel at 1 m resolution. The used image resolution
is generated by fusing MS bands with the PAN band. Herein, the Gram–Schmidt spectral
sharpen function was utilized supported by sensor type. The auxiliary data include field
survey data and a topographic map. The study area is located in the Xiejiadao Peninsula,
Huangdao District, Qingdao City, between latitudes 35◦ 5410 N and 35◦ 5540 N, longitudes
120◦ 1030 E and 120◦ 1200 E. There are mudflats, aquacultures, boats, seawater
below the coastline, residential areas (including building and yard), ponds, and agrarian
fields above the coastline, and the agrarian fields are in different stages of planting. Two
images were acquired at different years and during the same season. The acquisition of former
images was at 02:43 GMT, 17 April 2001 and the latter was acquired at 03:00 GMT,
25 April 2007.

3. Results
3.1. Result of change detection
The image registration procedure was carried out in the preprocessing, and the root
mean square error (RMSE) was 0.54 pixels. As a reference for change detection, the
land-cover change of the study area was identified in the vector layer (see Figure 4)
through image interpretation under the support of commercial GIS software (ArcGIS;
Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). The land-cover classification scheme referred to the standard
used in Chinese offshore investigation and assessment, which was slightly different
compared to recent research (Teodoro et al. 2011). About half of the coastline had
been modified in a short period. Two of the three aquaculture areas also disappeared
during this period. The proportion of residential areas was increasing and almost simultaneously,
the small ponds were changed either in part or as a whole. The agrarian
fields were changed not only into the other types but also changed with respect to
the planting and farming state. The result indicated that land-cover changed rapidly.
The change pattern was similar to the closer coastal area in East China (Liu, Liu, and
Tian 2005). The total area of the Xiejiadao Peninsula is 28.26 km2 and it increased
10.7% between 2001 and 2007, mainly from the tidal zone. Meanwhile, 11.0% of arable
land area decreased and the main cause of occupation was built-up and settlement
land.
In the postclassification change detection procedure, the segmentation scale was 30 for
both MS images. The result of segmentation was oversegmentation for most objects. The
overall accuracy of the 2001 image was 88.65%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.84.
The overall accuracy of the 2007 image was 84.59%, and the kappa coefficient was
0.79. Actually, the producer and user accuracies (see Table 1) of waterbody, cropland,
soil (reaped crop), woodland, and uncovered area were all larger than average. But the
accuracies of building, yard (area between buildings), road, and silt were less than the
average accuracy. The total accuracy of postclassification change detection without spatial
information supported was 73% (see Table 2). The strong attribute pixel change accuracy
increased to 84% and the weak attribute pixel change accuracy decreased to 36%
when the changed area was partitioned according to the classes. After integration with
spatial change information (see Figure 5), the pixels that were of weak attribute pixel
and shape changed occupied 22,452 pixels and its accuracy was 0.81. And the pixels
that were only weak attribute pixel changed occupied 101,702 pixels and its accuracy
was down to 0.26. In contrast, the pixels that are of strong attribute pixel and shape
changed occupied 256,037 pixels and its accuracy was up to 0.94, and the pixels that
were only strong attribute pixel changed occupied 161,563 pixels and its accuracy was
0.68. Furthermore, the result of change detection of the proposed approach has potential
improvement in case more meticulous works are performed like relative radiometric
normalization.
3.2. Traditional change detection enhanced by spatial change information
The IODA had been applied on the hierarchical network of image object candidates with
the ultimate scale 800. Here, the DIOs had different segmentation scales with different
DDFs (see Figure 6). In the vector layer shown in Figure 4, most of the filtered DIOs
were anthrop-impacted ground objects. The proposed method has produced improved
results (see Table 2), but not all land covers benefitted equally. The image object detection
results varied in the ability to reveal different ground objects (see Table 3). The
exhibitions of image object candidates were perfect, especially in residential areas and
agrarian fields. The changed inland aquacultures were detected well by the signal that the
merge and/or split of the corresponding image objects occurred (see Figure 6, below).
The land covers consisting of those image objects had a larger improvement in accuracy.
In contrast, the changed aquacultures under the coastline were not detected ideally
because in the fused image their small or narrow border could not be protected from
merging with their surroundings because of the same materials. The image objects in
the areas where land cover was changed from agrarian fields to settlements were acceptable
although their ground object size was relatively small. However, the built-up areas
of the settlement could not be identified well because of their size, and they were not
considered as DIOs. The accuracy for land covers with those image objects improved
less. Many agrarian fields were detected as changed areas according to their changed
shape. Such a case meant that the planting and farming state would change the result of
IODA. The segmentation is relative to the accuracy of the classification (see Table 1).
The higher accuracy of classification indicated that the ground object could be identified
from other classes, that also meant they were segmented from the surroundings
easily.
As a traditional preclassification method, the spectral change vector approach (CVA)
helped to determine whether there were any DIOs changed on the whole or whether there
were parts changed in the merge or split procedure (Johnson and Kasischke 1998). The
result of the image object-based change vector is clearer than the pixel-based result of the
CVA method (see Figure 7). On comparison with the pixel-based CVA method, the image
object-based method avoids the ‘salt-and-pepper’ phenomenon. The false small polygon,
which usually emerged in the result without accurate geometric registration, did not emerge
when we used the concept of DIO. Generally, the larger value of the spectral change vector
indicates the changed region and the lesser value indicates unchanged parts. The result
of the proposed approach would be more significative in high-resolution remote-sensed
images, where the DIOs can be obtained. In the study area, the traditional change detection
method is still important in image object-based change detection. But the image objectbased
change detection method adds more extra information on spatial information such as
merge or split.
4. Discussion
4.1. Changed shape means changed spectrum
Changed shape means either a merge or a split or both have occurred. It also indicates the
spectral difference in the parts of them. For multiscale segmentation, the spectral features
of two image objects f 1 and f 2 are considered to be similar when they are near to each
other. For an l-dimensional spectral space, the heterogeneity h is described as follows:
where d represents bands. These distances of f 1 and f 2 can be further normalized by
the standard deviation σfd of the spectrum. There are several possibilities for describing
the heterogeneity change before and after a virtual merge (a detailed discussion
is described by Baatz and Schäpe (2000)). Given an appropriate definition of heterogeneity,
the growth in heterogeneity of a merge should be minimized. Obviously,
the adjacent pixels set belonging to the same class would be segmented together
before.
The derived criteria from multiscale segmentation can convey useful information concerning
the discriminatory capability associated with an adopted spectral space. If one
candidate can be separable from surrounding candidates, on the classification view it can be
reflected by the derived criteria of classification such as the maximum inter-class distance
and the minimum intra-class diversity. For each image candidate, there are three phases
passed from being a one-pixel object to being an undersegmented object at a relatively
large segment scale, along with the multiscale segmentation procedure. In the oversegmentation
phase, for each object candidate in the range of one image object, there must be one
or more neighbourhood candidates in the same image object. The spectral mean of the candidate
can be considered as the sample’s mean ¯x and the variance of the candidate is the
variance of the sample’s standard deviation S. For innate merge, the sample’s means were
¯x
1, ¯x2 and standard deviations were S1, S2 before and the same statistics were ¯xm and Sm
after merge. The DDF of two candidates which came from the same image object, the candidates
were oversegmented, was relatively small in this phase. The optimal segmentation
phase followed the ending of the oversegmentation phase; there was a case where both the
candidate a and the candidate a belonged to the same image object. Apparently, the only
two bordering candidates would merge together at the optimal scale. This is related to the
spatial resolution of the image being used. The heterogeneity in the oversegmentation phase
was less than in the optimal phase. Subsequently, it was in the undersegmentation phase.
When two candidates included more than one image object, and n and m were the sample
numbers of these two candidates, the merged candidate had the difference in feature as
follows:
However, as is known, the variance of the candidate increased monotonously, so the DDF
tended to decrease. Two adjacent regions belonging to different classes were obliged to
merge together in the segmentation procedure. But they were not satisfying the condition
of optimal segmentation in IODA.
If DIOs existed and were neighbours together, they were considered to be belonging to
different classes. When the shape changed, the merge procedure indicated that two DIOs
separated in early time but did not separate in latter time. That also meant that two DIOs
did belong to two classes in former time but they belonged to the same class later. The
split procedure indicated that DIOs need to be classified into one class before but should
be classified into different classes later. That meant the shape of the image object could be
used in detection of the spectral change.
4.2. The meaningful image object is critical in using spatial information
In image object-based analysis, the pixel entities that are expected in remote-sensing images
can be related to real entities in the landscape. These regions are later related to geographic
objects through some object-based classification. To extract meaningful image objects,
users are required to focus on different intrinsic scales because all attributes of image
structure are almost highly scale dependent. Spatial information that we want to obtain
from the overlay function should be derived only from the image objects of intrinsic scales
but not of any general scales. Otherwise, it will lead to unreasonable results. This is why the
general result from traditional multiscale analysis cannot be adopted directly. And the optimal
segmentation and intrinsic scale identification are the predetermination of the image
object-based change detection.
Actually, these more important simple meaningful objects are the explicit homogeneous
objects, which have similar spectral characteristics yet differ from surrounding objects in
high-resolution remote-sensing imagery. In our study area, these objects included waterbodies,
residential areas, agrarian fields, and such anthropogenic-impacted ground objects.
Furthermore, the Shannon sampling theorem should be considered. In fact, if the border of
two ground objects or the size of the ground object is similar to the pixel size, the spectral
average of the image candidate will not be a real spectrum of a ground object because of
the problem of mixed pixels. Therefore, many man-made or anthropogenically influenced
objects are coincident with the defined term meaningful objects. The basic task of segmentation
algorithms is to merge image elements based on homogeneity parameters or on the
differentiation to neighbouring regions (heterogeneity), respectively. In other words, these
criteria can be explained as follows: in the segmentation procedure, the increased heterogeneity
can be interpreted as a border between the segments, which has to be overcome for
merging. The higher this border is for a certain segmentation parameter combination, the
more stable is the result (Benz et al. 2004). As long as the scale is the best, meaningful
objects can be obtained. Furthermore, in many cases significant objects appear at different
scales of analysis of the same image.
5. Conclusions
Image object-based change detection can be enhanced by spatial information in change
identification for both postclassification and preclassification approaches. Obviously, the
important information for understanding an image is not represented in a single pixel but
is embodied in meaningful image objects as well as their mutual relationships. The spatial
information of image objects is also an important cue to identify the change. In this
study, an image object-based method is presented to identify the changed areas using shape
difference of an image object between bi-temporal images of a coastal zone. We proposed
the concept and its definition of DIO. The DIO presentation was identified from
the results of optimal segmentation through the IODA. By using raster overlay analysis to
bi-temporal DIOs, the shape of image objects can be used to recognize the change evolution
by knowing its merge or split procedure. The classes conducted in postclassification
change detection were divided into a strong attribute pixel group and a weak attribute
pixel group according to its accuracy. After integration with spatial change information,
the accuracy of both weak attribute pixel and shape change was 0.81, and the only weak
attribute pixel that was changed was decreased from 0.36 down to 0.26. In contrast, the
accuracy of both strong attribute pixel and shape change was increased from 0.84 up to
0.94, and the accuracy of only the strong attribute pixel change was 0.68. The improved
accuracy depended on the ability that the obtained DIOs revealed the different ground
objects. The present method would be more significant in high-resolution remote-sensed
images. The spatially unchanged information can reduce overdetected areas and the spatially
changed information can certify the judgement of change. By analysis of the three
phases of the image segmentation procedure, the IODA was considered as a rational way
to derive intrinsic image objects from a hierarchic candidate. Thereby, the typical spectral
difference based change detection between bi-temporal images was instead of spatial
change detection between ground objects based on the spectral difference which would
be compared in an optimal segmentation procedure. The latter can be helpful in avoiding
some spectral reflection corrections caused by many image acquisition conditions in typical
change detection processes

Abstract:
Deep-sea mineral deposits potentially represent vast metal resources that could make a major contribution to
future global raw material supply. Increasing demand for these metals, many of which are required to enable a
low-carbon and high-technology society and to relieve pressure on land-based resources, may result in deep sea
mining within the next decade. Sea?oor massive sulphide (SMS) deposits, containing abundant copper, zinc,
gold and silver, have been the subject of recent and ongoing commercial interest. Although many sea?oor
hydrothermally systems have been studied, inactive SMS deposits are likely more accessible to future mining and
far more abundant, but are often obscured by pelagic sediment and hence difcult to locate. Furthermore, SMS
deposits are three dimensional. Yet, to date, very few have been explored or sampled below the sea?oor. Here,
we describe the most comprehensive study to date of hydrothermally extinct sea?oor massive sulphide (eSMS)
deposits formed at a slow spreading ridge. Our approach involved two research cruises in the summer of 2016 to
the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal feld at 26∼N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These expeditions
mapped a number of hydrothermally extinct SMS deposits using an autonomous underwater vehicle and remotely operated vehicle, acquired a combination of geophysical data including sub-sea?oor seismic re?ection
and refraction data from 25 ocean bottom instruments, and recovered core using a robotic lander-type sea?oor
drilling rig. Together, these results that have allowed us to construct a new generic model for extinct sea?oor
massive sulphide deposits indicate the presence of up to fve times more massive sulphide at and below the
sea?oor than was previously thought.

Introduction
Demand for mineral raw materials is increasing as a result of population growth, 
rising living standards, urbanisation and, more recently, the transition to a low-carbon economy (Zepf et al., 2014). Yet
the mining industry faces numerous challenges including rising costs,
reducing ore grades and declining discovery rates of new deposits
(Calvo et al., 2016). As a result, alternative sources of these minerals
are being considered, including the deep-ocean.
Sea?oor massive sulphide deposits, formed through hydrothermal
venting, are considered to be the modern analogous of ancient volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits preserved on land. Although the
number of hydrothermal vent discoveries has been steadily increasing
since the frst discovery at the Galapagos Rift in 1977 (Corliss et al.,
1979), and more than 600 sites are known today (Beaulieu et al., 2015),
the economic importance of the associated SMS deposits is poorly
known. Recent estimates suggest modern hydrothermally active sites
account, globally, for at least 650 million metric tonnes (Mt) of massive
sulphides containing 10 Mt of copper (Cu), 29 Mt of zinc (Zn), 1 Mt of
lead (Pb), 33 Mkg silver (Ag), and 750,000 kg gold (Au) (Hannington
et al., 1999, 2011). Published bulk geochemical data from 95 of these
modern SMS deposits suggest a median grade of 3 wt.-% Cu, 9 wt.-% Zn,
2 g/t Au and 100 g/t Ag (Hannington et al., 2011; Monecke et al.,
2016). However, these analyses are mainly derived from easily recoverable surface grab-samples, such as high-temperature sulphide
chimney and related talus material, and may not be representative of
the average composition of the deposits at depth. It is likely that the
vast majority of SMS deposits are no longer hydrothermally active and
are increasingly covered by pelagic sediment as they age. It remains
unknown what low temperature geological and environmental processes a?ect hydrothermally extinct SMS (eSMS) deposits once the ?ow
of chemically reduced hydrothermal ?uid ceases, whether the metal
tenor becomes enriched, depleted or disappears with time, and what
the structure and composition of these deposits is beneath the sea?oor.
To enhance our understanding of modern eSMS deposits, two research expeditions (M127 on RV Meteor and JC138 on RRS James
Cook) were conducted at the TAG hydrothermal feld at 26∼09∩N,
49∼30∩W, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, in 2016, as part of the EU-funded
Blue Mining project. The objectives were to determine the sub-sea?oor
morphology, mineralogy, composition and extent of the sulphide mineralisation in eSMS deposits. Here, we report the results of that work
and combine observations based on surface geology, sub-sea?oor drilling and seismic imaging, to yield a new model for eSMS deposits at
slow-spreading ridges.

Geological setting
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a slow-spreading (22 mm/year) ridge
(Kleinrock and Humphris, 1996), and the associated TAG hydrothermal
feld is one of the most intensively studied sea?oor hydrothermal systems (e.g. Rona et al., 1975, 1984, 1986; 1993a,b; Humphris et al.,
1995, 2015; Humphris and Kleinrock, 1996; Evans, 1996; Tivey et al.,
1995, 1996; Petersen et al., 2000; DeMartin et al., 2007; Zhao et al.,
2012). It lies at water depths ranging from 3,430 to 3,670 m on the
eastern and shallowest part of a 75 km-long, second-order spreading
segment bounded by two right-lateral non-transform discontinuities at
25∼58∩N and 26∼17∩N (Fig. 1A). The TAG segment is characteristic of
most slow-spreading ridge segments, having a fault-bounded graben,
bound by abyssal hills and faults (here oriented NNW-SSE) forming a
deep axial valley that hosts a neovolcanic zone comprising young lavas,
hummocky volcanic ridges and isolated volcanoes (White et al., 1998).
The active TAG mound is the current locus of venting of high
temperature (up to 363 ∼C) hydrothermal ?uids, that has resulted in the
formation of a 200 m diameter, 50 m high circular deposit topped by a
number of 12 m-tall black-smoker chimneys (Humphris et al., 2015).
During ocean drilling programme (ODP) Leg158, in 1994, seventeen
holes were drilled at fve locations into the active TAG mound
(Humphris et al., 1995). The maximum depth of penetration was 125 m
below sea?oor (mbsf). The holes intersected massive pyrite breccia in
the upper part of the mound overlying anhydrite-rich breccia, below
which a silicifed, pyritised, altered basaltic stockwork was encountered. The lowermost part of the drill holes intersected highly-altered basaltic host rock. Metals of economic interest such as Cu, Zn, Ag
and Au were only found to be enriched in the upper 5 m of the mound
(Hannington et al., 1998) whereas mainly barren massive pyrite body
was identifed below this depth.
Radiometric dating indicates hydrothermal activity at the active
TAG mound frst started 50,000 years ago with episodic periods of activity of tens to hundreds of years (Lalou et al., 1990) characterised by
accumulation and recrystallisation of sulphides, precipitation of substantial amounts of anhydrite, and remobilisation of metals. Intervening
periods of hydrothermal inactivity lasted 3,000 to 5,000 years, during
which mass wasting, anhydrite dissolution and interior brecciation
occurred. The current period of hydrothermal activity at the active TAG
mound commenced about 80 years ago (Lalou et al., 1998).
In addition to the active TAG mound, at least seven other hydrothermally inactive or eSMS deposits have previously been identifed
(Fig. 1B) in an area of ‵2.5 km2 (Rona et al., 1993a,b). The largest
cluster of deposits is known as the Alvin Zone and lies ‵1.5 km northnortheast of the active TAG mound, at a depth of 3,400 to 3,600 m. It
consists of a number of roughly circular individual mounds (Fig. 2A)
that are typically up to 60 m high, 100 to 300 m in diameter, formed
from weathered sulphide talus, variably covered in pelagic and hydrothermal sediment (Humphris et al., 2015 and references therein),
and are between 6,000 to 75,000 years old (Lalou et al., 1990, 1993,
1998). These mounds include Double, Shinkai and Southern (Fig. 2B,C).
Another 200 m diameter area of iron-oxide and weathered sulphide
material, called Shimmering Mound, occurs 1 km to the north of
Shinkai Mound where low temperature ?uids (≒22 ∼C) di?use through
iron-bearing silicates, iron-oxyhydroxides (FeOOH) and iron-manganese oxides (Humphris et al., 2015). During cruise M127 (Petersen and
Shipboard Scientifc party, 2016), further hydrothermal structures were
discovered including a 30 m high, 100 m diameter, dome-shaped
mound, named Rona Mound (Fig. 2D) after the late Peter Rona, who
was the frst to discoverer hydrothermal activity at the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge (Rona et al., 1975, 1984). Two smaller mounds (~20每30 diameter) on the north-eastern and south-eastern side of Shinkai Mound,
are called New Mound #2 and New Mound #3 (Fig. 2A-B).
In addition to the extensive Alvin Zone, a second hydrothermally
inactive site occurs, called the MIR Zone (Fig. 2E). This site is located
two kilometres to the east-northeast of the active TAG Mound in water
depths of 3,430 to 3,575 m. In comparison to the Alvin Zone, this area
lacks mound-like features, and instead comprises a raised area of irregular and undulating sea?oor, several 100∩s m in diameter and a few
10∩s m high, composed of an accumulation of weathered sulphide material and iron-rich sediments with a discontinuous pelagic sediment
cover (White et al., 1998). Rona et al. (1993a) divide the MIR Zone into
three distinct areas. The western part comprises weathered sulphide
debris and hydrothermal sediments that are underlain by hydrothermal
breccia. In contrast, the central zone is dominated by toppled and
standing relict chimneys. No sulphides are recorded from the eastern
zone where FeOOH, iron-rich clays and manganese oxy-hydroxide
(MnOOH) crusts occur. Radiometric dating indicates that hydrothermal
activity commenced 140,000 years ago with the last active episode
ceasing only 600 years ago (Lalou et al., 1993; Humphris and Tivey,
2000).
The TAG hydrothermal feld is a basalt-hosted system (Rona et al.,
1993a,b) and the composition of the vent ?uids and their mineral deposits are consistent with ?uid interaction with a mafc host rock
(Campbell et al., 1988). As such, the TAG hydrothermal feld can be
considered a classic example of a modern, volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit and is distinct from deposits formed in intra-continental
rift zones, back-arc basins and volcanic arcs. Recent studies have shown
that the TAG hydrothermal feld is formed on the hanging wall of an
active detachment fault (Tivey et al., 2003), with seismic data indicating the footwall comprises lower-crustal or serpentinised uppermantle lithologies (DeMartin et al., 2007).
No accurate resource estimates are available for the whole TAG
hydrothermal feld, although attempts have been made using bulk
geochemical data from the literature and combining them with the
volume of the mounds above the surrounding sea?oor under the premise that Alvin and MIR zones consist of similar lithologies to those
observed in the sub-sea?oor beneath the TAG mound. Based on these
data, the mass of sulphides in the active TAG Mound is thought to be up
to 3.9 million tons (Hannington et al., 1998) and the Alvin and MIR
zones each range between 1 to 4 million tons. However, many of the
samples used to estimate the composition of the eSMS mounds are
surface grab material, such as chimney fragments enriched in Cu, Zn,
Au and Ag, and may not be representative of the three-dimensional
deposit at depth.
Until now, the focus of the majority of research in the TAG hydrothermal feld has been on the high-temperature active TAG mound.
Here, we focus on the hydrothermally eSMS deposits in the Alvin and
MIR zones, with the aim to characterise their structure and composition
at depth, and determine common processes a?ecting their evolution,
degradation and preservation on and below the sea?oor.

Method
The data reported here were collected during the EU-funded Blue
Mining programme expeditions M127 (RV Meteor) and JC138 (RRS
James Cook) in May to August 2016. An important and novel aspect of
our study was the collection and integration of geological and geophysical data acquired from the same area. The study area was initially
mapped using the ship＊s multibeam echosounder, followed by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions for high resolution mapping
of the eSMS mounds. These were then imaged using a variety of geophysical methods, that occupied the same profle lines across eSMS
mounds, followed by surveys using a robotic underwater vehicle (RUV)
and drilling by a robotic lander-type sea?oor drilling rig (RD2). From
this body of complementary data we are able to describe the common
features of the eSMS deposits, starting from the surface geology (including exposures of basement in fault scarps) and progressing through
drilled core to a maximum depth of 12.5 mbsf. Whole-rock material
from the core was geochemically and petrologically analysed for major
and trace element variations and sulphide mineralogy. To obtain information on the deeper subsurface, i.e. below the maximum drilling
depth, geophysical methods were used including seismic data acquired
by 25 ocean bottom seismometers placed on and around the eSMS
mounds. These mainly recorded internal re?ections from within the
deposits and the underlying crust, down to depths of ‵400 mbsf.
Refractions from deeper in the crust, down to 3.5 km, were also acquired. Controlled source electromagnetic surveys were also conducted
but the results are presented elsewhere.
3.1. AUV, RUV mapping and surface sampling
Given their water depth (3,600 m) and relatively small size
(100每300 m diameter), high-resolution bathymetry data were acquired
from near the sea?oor using an AUV operated by GEOMAR (Petersen
and Shipboard Scientifc party, 2016) during M127. Multibeam swath
sonar data were acquired from a RESON Seabat 7125 operated at 200/
400 kHz frequencies and processed to a resolution of between 2 and
0.5 m. The AUV was navigated using a long-baseline acoustic system,
and later dead-reckoning using Doppler velocity logging and an Inertial
Navigation System. Multiple missions were undertaken over the TAG
hydrothermal feld, from a variety of altitudes, and the data geographically merged for internal consistency, gridded, and geographically co-registered by locating the images to the 3 m-diameter
steel re-entry cones left by the ODP drilling sites on the active TAG
mound, which have well-known locations. High-resolution maps of the
individual eSMS mounds were generated at a resolution of 0.5 m and
reveal details of the deposits including fault scarps, collapse structures
and extinct chimneys.
The surface geology of the eSMS mounds was studied during the
second cruise (JC138) by videography and sampling from the RUV
HyBIS (Murton et al., 2012), focussing on the Shinkai, Southern and
Rona mounds (Murton and Shipboard Scientifc Party, 2018). Missions
were planned on the basis of the AUV-derived bathymetry maps and
RUV navigation used ultra-short baseline (USBL) with a precision
of ㊣ 5 m and an accuracy of ㊣ 10 m. In total, 52 h of HD video imagery
were obtained during seven dives. A total of twenty-nine HyBIS surface
samples were obtained mainly from Southern Mound, with a few
samples from Rona and Shinkai mounds. These provide information on
the near-sea?oor composition and allowed validation of observations
made from the video images.
3.2. Coring of sediments
Sediment samples were largely collected by 3 m-long gravity coring
to characterise the superfcial sea?oor geology. The thickest sediment
accumulations were identifed from the multibeam bathymetry (being
smooth and having low acoustic backscatter) and shipboard sub-bottom
profler data. Gravity cores were navigated subsea by USBL and acquired from the top and base of the eSMS mounds, and up to several
kilometres away, targeting sediment ponds and areas with thinner sediment. The sediments are classifed as being hydrothermally in?uenced when iron and base metals, such as copper and zinc, exceed the
value found in the background pelagic sediments (carbonate ooze).
Variation in iron and manganese content relate to hydrothermal plume
fall-out, and high-sulphide concentrations are the result of massive
sulphide erosion, transport and deposition.
3.3. Drilling
Following the mapping phase, JC138 deployed the RD2, operated
by British Geological Survey. The RD2 system is capable of coring up to
55 mbsf in water depths up to 4,000 m. Several sensors allow real-time
monitoring of drilling parameters such as revolutions per minute,
torque, bit weight, feed force, feed pressure, feed speed, water ?ow and
water ?ush rates. Landing RD2 on surfaces on the mounds that were ?at
enough and could support the weight of the rig to ensure a fnal inclination of less than 5∼ proved difcult. Despite the relatively precise
navigation provided by our USBL system, these ?at target benches were
no more than 10 m in diameter. To facilitate the fnal landing, ?ashing
beacons were placed on the sea?oor by the RUV HyBIS, following drill
site selection.
3.4. Petrological and geochemical analyses
Full drill cores and sediment gravity cores were described, photographed, split and subsampled on board. Polished thin (30 米m) and
thick sections (200 米m) were made from selected pieces for petrological
and micro-analytical studies using transmitted and re?ected light microscopy.
Bulk geochemical data were obtained from individual or composite
quarter-core pieces of the same lithology. These were crushed, powdered and homogenised with 10 g of each sample being analysed by
Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs, 2017) in Canada, using: Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INNA), sodium peroxide fusion
with Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICPOES) & Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses, total sulphur infrared
spectroscopy, and cold vapour ?ow-injection atomic absorption spectrometry. Sediment analysis performed on approximately 100 mg of
acid-digested dried and ground material, after applying an internal
spike of Be, Re and In. Analysis was performed by ICP-OES for major
elements (e.g. Ca, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) and by ICP-MS for minor elements and trace element (e.g. Cu for some depths). Precision and accuracy were determined for each analytical run by repeat analysis
(n = 3) of the two Certifed Reference Materials: (i) marine sediments
MESS-1 (National Research Council of Canada) and (ii) sulphide ore
mill tailings RTS-1 (National Research Council of Canada). Elemental
precision for each run was less than 4% and 2.7%, respectively, except
for Zn which was up to 13% by ICP-OES due to a low concentration in
RTS-1 and MESS-1. Silica concentrations in jasper samples were determined by X-Ray Flourescence (XRF) using approximately 0.5 g of
dried, ground and homogenised material, mixed with Lithium Tetraborate ?ux and fused into a glass beads. These were analysed on a
Philips? MagiX-Pro 4 kW using a Rh X-ray tube.
Mineral identifcation in sediment was performed on homogenised
dried powder samples using an X-Ray di?ractometer (MiniFlexII,
Rigaku, Japan) equipped with MiniFlex2 + goniometer and detector.
CuK汐1 radiation (1.541 ?) was applied at 30 kV, with 15 mA of beam
current. The 2牟 incidence angle spanned from 5∼ to 60∼ with a scan
speed of 1.2∼/min using a continuous scan mode. Quartz standards were
also run to ensure calibration. The data were analysed using the
※Panalytical Highscore§ software with reference to the ICDD minerals
database 2018.
3.5. Geophysics
To assess the dimensions and structure of the deep interior of the
TAG eSMS mounds, active seismic experiments were performed using
two di?erent air-gun source arrays: a G-gun array (760 cubic-inch, 2 m
depth, 12 s shot interval) for lines up to 10 km-long, and a GI-gun array
(210 cubic-inch, 6 m depth, 9 s shot interval) for the shorter lines up to
5 km-long, respectively. Twenty Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) and
fve Ocean Bottom Hydrophones (OBH) recorded the airgun shots. To
obtain the internal velocity and gross geometries of the deposits, 10 of
the 20 OBS were placed on top of the Shinkai and Southern mounds by
the RUV HyBIS, with an o?set between instruments of about 75 m for
the central part of the mounds. The other instruments (10 OBS and 10
OBH) were deployed by free-fall along crossing seismic profles with
o?sets of 350每750 m between instruments.
Following acquisition, the OBS records were processed by separating the di?erent shot lines, accurately locating the ocean bottom instruments on the sea?oor, fltering to remove source ringing and ?attening of the records to the frst arrival for easier arrival identifcation/
picking. P-wave velocity-depth models for the profles were then generated by forwarding modelling the travel-times using the RAYINVR
ray-tracing software (Zelt and Smith, 1992). Starting conditions, used
to set the initial boundary conditions in the inversion modelling, were
based on laboratory measured seismic velocities for materials recovered
during ODP drilling of the active TAG mound (Table 1). The model was
iterated to establish new velocities for the eSMS mounds that minimise
the misft between the observed and modelled arrivals. Fig. 3 shows
examples for OBS #04, located on the ?ank of Shinkai mounds, and the
best-ft solutions (in black) between the velocity model and the arrivals
picked from the seismic records

Result
4.1. Geology of the TAG hydrothermal feld
Multibeam swath bathymetry mapping of the TAG hydrothermal
feld shows signifcant variability in tectonic and volcanic processes.
The central part of the TAG hydrothermal feld is characterized by
hummocky volcanic lavas that coalesce into mounds, 100每500 m in
diameter, forming a neovolcanic zone ‵1 km to the west of the eSMS
mounds (Fig. 1B). The westernmost part of the area generally comprises
unfaulted hummocky lava mounds and ridges, including a frozen lavalake ‵500 m to the east of the active TAG mound. In the centre of the
TAG hydrothermal feld, a zone of extensional faulting is dominated by
NNE-SSW strikes (Fig. 2A). At ‵29∼09.5∩N, these fault traces bend towards a N-S trend southward, indicative of left-lateral shear. The convergence of these fault orientations coincides with the Alvin Zone,
where the most prominent eSMS mounds are located, and they are
thought to control hydrothermal ?uid pathways from deep within the
crust (Karson and Rona, 1990; Kleinrock and Humphris, 1996).
4.2. Morphology of eSMS mounds
The highest resolution bathymetry reveals changes in slope and
mass wasting features that indicate relative ages for the eSMS mounds
in the Alvin Zone (Fig. 4). Of these, the Shinkai Mound and the adjacent
New Mounds appear to be younger, based on their steeper slopes and
sharp conical shapes with meter-high pinnacles on the summits, indicative of relict hydrothermal chimneys. Double, Southern and Rona
mounds appear to be older, despite being located only 500 m further to
the east, having much smoother and more rounded features, more dome
like than conical, and being intensely dissected by curved faults. The
gentle slopes and smoothness of these older eSMS mounds re?ects the
presence of a thicker sediment cover and the lack of relict chimney
structures. Shinkai and the New Mounds have average slope gradients
(height/radius) of about 0.5 with average slope angles of 27 ㊣ 3∼. In
contrast, Southern, Double and Rona mounds have average slope gradients of about 0.34每0.39, with average slope angles of 20 ㊣ 1∼, respectively (Table 2). Although there is some uncertainty ( ㊣ 10%) in
these slopes due to asymmetry of the mounds and the true extent of the
edge of the sulphide apron, the di?erences are consistent with the relative age of the mounds, described above.
The MIR Zone lies in the south-east corner of the TAG hydrothermal
feld, on an elevated block formed by a west-facing fault that runs for
over a kilometre in a N每S direction (Fig. 2E). It comprises a
(450 m ℅ 300 m), oval-shaped zone of inactive sulphides and relict
chimneys, and the constructive feature is smaller than previously
thought (Rona et al., 1993b). Small mound-like features are arranged
around the circumference of the MIR Zone that is incised by slump
structures and scours on both the SE and NW sides where mass-wasted
blocks and rubble appear to have ?owed down-slope.
4.3 Surface geology of the eSMS mounds
Five of the eSMS mounds (Shinkai, the New Mounds, Southern and
Rona) were surveyed by the RUV HyBIS in detail, and the geological
map produced for Southern Mound is the most comprehensive (Fig. 5).
The majority of Southern and Rona mounds are covered by thin pelagic
sediment. NE每SW trending, conjugate inward dipping and arcuate, low
4.4. Surface lithologies from the eSMS mounds
Surface samples from the eSMS mounds comprise both chimney
fragments and massive sulphide blocks (Fig. 7A每C). Chimney fragments
were only recovered from Shinkai Mound and the New Mounds and
include intact ?uid conduits lined by marcasite, idaite, covellite with
chalcopyrite closer to the outside. Other chimney fragments are composed of chalcopyrite with traces of isocubanite, marcasite and pyrite
hosted in a matrix of amorphous silica.
At Southern Mound, the surface material includes massive pyrite
breccia and layered massive sulphides comprising pyrite and/or marcasite, chalcopyrite and minor chalcocite. The external surfaces of these
samples are coated by a thin FeOOH layer and associated atacamite,
jarosite and minerals of the quartz-group or opal, indicating low-temperature seawater-related weathering. The interiors comprise mainly
porous massive pyrite, with either cubic or coarse-grained subhedral
textures with the latter resulting from high-temperature recrystallization (Fig. 7G). Locally, micro-sized inclusions of sphalerite and/or
chalcopyrite occur within massive, porous, colloform and coarsegrained subhedral pyrite (Fig. 7N,O). Sometimes, this pyrite is overgrown by chalcopyrite,
 that has altered to chalcocite along micro-
fractures, or is surrounded by marcasite (Fig. 7N).
At Rona Mound, surface samples comprise mainly massive sulphide
breccia and material from extinct hydrothermal chimneys. These samples contain colloform and recrystallised pyrite, also overgrown by
chalcopyrite and with chalcocite replacement along zones of microfracturing. Here the matrix of the sulphide breccia consists of quartz
with, locally developed, acicular needles of barite.
4.5. Metalliferous sediments
Sediment thickness varies signifcantly across the TAG hydrothermal feld (Fig. 8). Gravity coring, using a 3 m-long corer, recovered
either the full thickness of the sediment column where the basement
was intersected, or penetrated sediments in excess of 3.1 m, based on
recovery from overshoot by the corer where the basement was not intersected. Sediment thickness (Fig. 8A), facies (based on hydrothermal
in?uence) and Cu concentration across the TAG hydrothermal feld is
shown on maps derived from analyses of the core material (Fig. 8B).
The variation in sediment thickness re?ects a combination of topographical and sea?oor age variation. For example, on the summits of
the eSMS mounds, pelagic and hydrothermal sediment thicknesses
range from being largely absent on the summit of Shinkai Mound, to
between 1.67 and 2.78 m on top of Southern Mound, reach up to 2.78 m
on top of Rona Mound, and between 0.7 and 2.0 m on top of the MIR
Zone. This variability correlates with the relative ages of the mounds, as
discussed above.
The mineralogy of the sulphide-rich sediments, closest to the base of
the mounds, consists mainly of pyrite and chalcopyrite, with subordinate sphalerite and seawater alteration products (e.g. paratacamite). These sediments contain up to 39 wt.-% Fe, 17.2 wt.-% Cu
and 203 ppb Au. In a proximal channel, extending to the south-east of
Southern Mound, a thickness of at least 10 m of metalliferous sediment
was found exposed in fault scarps several hundred metres from the base
of the mound. Here, the sediments comprise alternating centimetrescale layers of fning-upward, fne-grained FeOOH and sulphide (pyrite
and chalcopyrite) sands intercalated with pelagic carbonate ooze enriched in iron oxides (Fig. 9). These mineralogically and texturally
immature sediments indicate rapid deposition as a result of mass
wasting of weathered and oxidised hydrothermal chimney materials
that are rapidly buried by further sediment deposition. Copper concentrations in these sediments are relatively high, reaching up to
10 wt.-%. Pelagic carbonate layers indicate pauses in hydrothermal
sediment deposition. The dip of layers within some of these cores decreases from ‵30∼ at the base to near zero at the top, re?ecting local
and progressive tilting of the basement, probably in response to NW
dipping faults that dissect the channel. Coring and sea?oor video surveys traced the channel for at least 1 km to the south-east of the eSMS
mounds.
In summary, the surface geology reveals a similar structure for a
number of eSMS mounds in the TAG hydrothermal feld. The tops and
?anks of the mounds are composed of unsorted sulphide-talus with
iron-oxide sediment, and often largely draped in a veil of pelagic carbonate ooze. The extent and thickness of the pelagic sediment, the
presence of relict hydrothermal structures, and the aspect ratios and
slopes of the mounds re?ects their relative age. The lower slopes and
margins of the mounds are covered by hydrothermal sediments forming
upwards-fning layers of sulphide sands and iron oxides. Some of these
are intercalated with pelagic carbonates indicating pauses in hydrothermal sediment deposition. The presence of inward dipping, arcuate
faults appears to be a common feature and also correlates with increasing age and size of the mounds, with the oldest and largest having
the most prominent fault structures. Exposure of the interior of the
mounds is limited to these fault scarps and reveals a sequence of pelagic
sediment overlying metalliferous turbidite sediments that in turn overly
massive sulphide breccia that on-laps a basaltic basement of pillow
lavas.
4.6. Drilling results
A total of eight holes were drilled on the top of the eSMS deposits at
Southern, Rona and MIR (Fig. 2C每E), yielding a total core recovery of
9.51 m, with an average recovery of 29.2%, and a maximum penetration of 12.5 mbsf (Table 3). A general down-hole stratigraphy is shown
in Fig. 10, with depths of lithologies reconstructed by correlating recovered core with drilling telemetry (e.g., weight on bit, torque, rotation speed and penetration rate). Geochemical compositions are reported for averages of quarter core sections, and discrete facies, up to
0.25 m long. A common lithological sequence was observed at all three
eSMS mounds including: a layer of pelagic and metalliferous sediment
overlying a layer of dense jasper, several metres thick, that transitions
downwards into massive brecciated sulphide dominated by pyrite with
chalcopyrite overgrowths and veins.
4.6.1. Southern Mound
At the summit of Southern Mound, core was obtained from three
drill holes (stations 022, 031 and 050) (Fig. 10A). The uppermost layer
comprises pelagic carbonate sediment, up to 20 cm thick, underlain by
2.5每3.5 m of orange-brown to reddish coloured, soft and
unconsolidated hydrothermal sediment with oxidised, relict chimney
fragments, confrming observations and samples obtained by the RUV
HyBIS. This material mainly comprises iron-rich clays and rare, centimetre-thick, blackish MnOOH layers, e.g., at 1.8 mbsf. Beneath the ironrich sediments, a layer up to 3.1 m thick of jasper (silica-rich iron
stained material) occurs. This merges downwards into an intercalated,
0.6 m-thick layer of brecciated jasper at around 5.40每5.85 mbsf. The
jasper is quite heterogeneous in appearance, showing a range of colours
from orange (upper layers 每 Fig. 11A-B), to dark red (main portion 每
Fig. 11C-D), to mottled red每orange and grey (e.g. near the base 每
Fig. 11E), and it has variable porosity of 5每20%, measured from thin
sections. The upper-most portion of the jasper layer has vuggy and
sponge-like texture (Fig. 11G) and contains trace quantities of disseminated pyrite that become increasingly massive with depth
(Fig. 11I). The main minerals in the red jasper and jasper breccia are
quartz (‵55每90%) and hematite (‵5每40%), whereas the more massive
orange coloured jasper is typically composed of opal-CT, quartz, and
goethite, with minor hematite. The lower-most parts of the jasper layer
are composed of silicifed breccia containing disseminated pyrite and
rare grains of chalcopyrite (Fig. 11F,K, L). Massive sulphide was encountered at the bottom of the hole (6.7 mbsf) and consists of colloidal
pyrite surrounded by recrystallised pyrite that is locally surrounded by
traces of chalcopyrite (Fig. 7D,M)
4.6.2. Rona Mound
At the summit of Rona Mound, cores were obtained from three drill
holes (stations 057, 065, 068 (Fig. 10B). Although the unconsolidated
pelagic and hydrothermal sediments observed from the RUV HyBIS
images were not recovered, drill telemetry data (rapid penetration rate
and low torque) suggest these are about 2.80 m thick. RUV HyBIS observations indicate they are composed of ‵ 30 cm pelagic ooze overlying 2.5 m of iron-rich sediment. Beneath this, a layer up to 2.5 m thick
of dark red, massive textured jasper was encountered, similar to that
found at Southern Mound, but with a lower total porosity of 5%. The
predominant minerals in the jasper are cristobalite/tridymite
(‵80每90%), with subordinate hematite (‵5每10%) and the deepest
part of the jasper contains patches of intermixed goethite and haematite
with traces of pyrite. This transitions into a zone of mixed red and orange-jasper-silica breccia that consists of cristobalite/tridymite with
minor hematite, goethite, disseminated pyrite and (rare) sphalerite.
Beneath this transitional zone, brecciated massive sulphide was encountered down to a depth of 12.5 mbsf. The upper (6每9 mbsf) part is
composed of porous (5每15%) and silicifed marcasite with minor pyrite,
sphalerite and traces of barite (Fig. 7N). The sulphides have a brownish,
colloidal core of coliform pyrite with overgrowths of marcasite and
sphalerite. The lower (9每12.5 mbsf) part is composed of massive colloidal textured pyrite, frequently surrounded by recrystallised pyrite
that, in turn, is surrounded by chalcopyrite overgrown by sphalerite
(Fig. 7L,O)
4.6.3. MIR Zone
At the MIR Zone, two holes were drilled (stations 073, 076) on a
small platform on the inner north-eastern side of the deposit (Fig. 10C).
Pelagic sediments, with a thickness of 18 cm, are underlain by hydrothermal iron-rich sediments extending down to a depth of 70 cm,
overlying a ‵10 cm thick layer of FeOOH. This is underlain by a 2.8 m
thick zone of jasper, similar to that encountered at Southern and Rona
mounds. Here, the jasper ranges from red to orange and has a mean
porosity of 15每5%. The red jasper consists of quartz (‵55每85%) and
hematite (‵5每35%), with traces of pyrite. The orange jasper is mineralogically distinct, containing quartz (‵60每70%), hematite
(‵5每15%) and FeOOH (‵10%) but no sulphides. At about 3.6 mbsf,
slightly porous massive sulphide breccia is present, dominated by pyrite
with minor chalcopyrite occurring in veins and as overgrowths.
4.7 Metal distribution
Although the three SMS mounds drilled have similar lithostratigraphy, the metal distribution between the mounds is variable (Fig. 10,
Table 4). With the exception of Mn-rich horizons or encrustations, both
on the surface and within the sediments, in which Cu concentrations
can reach 1.42 wt-%, the Fe-rich sediments from the summits of the
three sulphide mounds typically have low concentrations of Cu and Zn
(i.e. less than 0.5 wt-%). At Southern Mound, the Fe-rich sediments
have a Mn-rich horizon (14.9 wt-%) at 1.8 mbsf. At the MIR Zone,
Mn〞rich horizons are found at the top (2.47 wt-%) of the Fe-rich sediments and at its base (3.38 wt-%). The Mn-rich horizon deeper in the
sediment profle coincides with a peak in Cu (1 wt-%), which otherwise
remains low (< 0.2 wt-%) until encountering the massive sulphide
zone. At Southern Mound and MIR Zone, the jasper appears to be
barren of metals of economic interest, whereas at Rona Mound, just
above the brecciated transition zone, it displays some enrichment in Zn
(0.98 wt-%).
At all the eSMS mounds we drilled, the massive sulphide zone has
the highest base metal concentrations. For example, at Southern
Mound, Cu concentrations increase to 0.98 wt.-% at the base of the hole
(6.6 mbsf). At Rona Mound, Cu and Zn concentrations also increase
towards the base of the hole, with two peaks in Cu occurring at
8每9 mbsf (5.8 wt.-%) and 12 mbsf (3.2 wt.-%), while Zn concentrations
reach a peak of 8.4 wt.-% between 7.4 and 9 mbsf. At the MIR Zone, Cu
concentrations in the massive sulphide increase downwards, reaching
16.1 wt.-% (at 4每4.5 mbsf), and then remain high, but variable,
reaching a peak of 20.4 wt.-% at 6.4 mbsf (Fig. 10). Covariation of
metals in samples from both the drill core and the surface material is
summarized in Fig. 12. The manganese-rich horizons are distinguished
by having < 1 wt.-% Zn, < 10 wt.-% Si and S, up to 28 wt.-% Cu, and
up to 35 wt.-% Fe. The jaspers and silicifed jasper breccia have up to
45 wt.-% Si and up to 42 wt.-% Fe, but low S, Cu, and Zn. Surface
massive sulphides have low Zn and S concentrations, but some samples
contain elevated values of Cu and Fe, with a clear trend indicating a
mixture of pyrite and Cu-sulphides (Fig. 12). These sulphides contain
the highest concentrations of Cu (up to 42 wt.-%) re?ecting both the
presence of chalcopyrite and possibly bornite. The sub-sea?oor
sulphides are dominated by pyrite with low Zn (one sample has up to
8.6 wt.-%) and low Si concentrations. Some samples contain up to
20 wt.-% Cu, especially those from the greatest depth below sea?oor. A
single sample has up to 8.6 wt.-% Zn.
4.8. Geophysics 每 seismic results
To assess the dimension, structure and lithology of the deep interior
of the eSMS mounds, coincident geophysical lines were occupied including active seismic studies. Here, we focus on the result of one of the
shorter, 5 km-long (NW-SE) seismic lines shot using GI-guns over both
Shinkai and Southern mounds, with re?ections and refractions recorded
on a number of ocean bottom seismometers placed on and around the
mounds (see Fig. 2A for the orientation of the line and locations of the
OBS＊s discussed here). Fig. 13 shows examples of processed arrivals (see
Methods for details) from record sections from four OBS sensors (OBS-
01, 04, 08, 09) located along the Line 1 (the NW-SE profle line (white
dashed-line in Fig. 2A). The record sections show similar basement and
intracrustal re?ections (PbP and PmP), from within the altered upper
oceanic crust and from the within the unaltered oceanic crust, respectively, which informs us of the geometry and thickness of each layer. In
addition, a crustal refraction (Pb) yields information about the velocity
of the deeper layers. OBS-04 and OBS-08 (located on the crest of the
mounds) have an additional re?ection horizon (PeP), which corresponds to a P-to-P re?ection from immediately beneath the eSMS
mounds.
OBS sensors located on top of the mounds reveal a P-wave velocity
model, derived using the iterative method to best ft the observed arrivals (described in the Methods section above) for the eSMS mounds
and their sub-sea?oor geometry (Fig. 14 and inset detailed panels). The
deeper structure was obtained from 10 km-long G-gun profles. The
shallow structure reveals a ‵350 m wide, 150每210 m thick downward
narrowing cone, with inward-dipping boundaries between relatively
higher and lower velocities that we interpret as corresponding to the
mineralised zone and altered basaltic host, respectively. Our travel-time
inversion indicates the average P-wave velocity within the high-velocity sub-sea?oor mineralised zone beneath the mounds is c.
5.0 ㊣ 0.4 km/s. Additional, very shallow PeP arrivals from within that
zone (Fig. 13B,C) suggest a potential 2-layer architecture, composed of
a higher velocity (4.2每6.6, average 5.4 km/s), 50每100 m thick upperlayer (zone 1) and lower velocity (4每5.5 average, 4.75 km/s), ‵100 m
thick deeper root (zone 2). This transitions into a lower velocity
(3.65 km/s) material (zone 3), which we interpreted as the host rock.
Outside the eSMS mounds, the crustal structure appears as two
distinct layers forming a 2每2.5 km thick section with upper crustal velocities of 3.5每4.7 km/s (See refraction Pb, Fig. 13A,C,D) and a lower
crustal velocity of 5.7 to 7.2 km/s (Fig. 14). The upper crustal layer
thins towards the southeast where it is separated from the lower crustal
section by a marked velocity change with the higher velocities (7.0 km/
s) almost emerging at the sea?oor.
In summary, the seismic data yield signifcant details about the
geometry of the eSMS mounds and their associated velocity, and hence
lithological, structure at depth. Both Southern and Shinkai mounds
have a similar high velocity, cone-shaped body that narrows
downwards, host within a lower velocity surrounding basement.
Shinkai mound has a maximum height of 65 m, a basal radius of 130 m,
a maximum depth for zone 1 of 80 mbsf ㊣ 10% and a maximum depth
for zone 2 of 220 mbsf ㊣ 10%,. Southern mound has a maximum
height of 55 m, a basal radius of 160 m, a maximum depth for zone 1 of
150 mbsf ㊣ 10%, and a maximum depth for zone 2 of 270 mbsf ㊣
10%. The ratio between mound radius, zone 1 and zone 2 maximum
depths for both these examples is ‵0.61 and 1.4每1.7, respectively.

Discussion
5.1. Towards a generic model for eSMS deposits at a slow spreading ridge
Combining the surface geology information and drill core with the
geophysical data from across the TAG hydrothermal feld allows us to
construct a composite model for the structure of the eSMS mounds
(Fig. 15A). The three eSMS mounds have many similarities; they are
draped in a veil of pelagic sediment, underlain by 1每3 m of barren, ironoxide/oxyhydroxide-rich sediments, with intercalated thin layers of
manganese oxyhydroxide. The iron-oxide/oxyhydroxide-rich sediments
have low base metal content, but appear to be derived from weathering
of hydrothermal sulphides from the summits of the mounds (e.g.
chimneys), which have been variably altered through interaction with
seawater. Sediments at the base of, and distal from, the mounds are
composed of sulphide sands and iron oxides, and often have a fning
upwards sequence, typical for turbidite deposits resulting from mass
wasting of the eSMS mounds. The preservation of higher Cu contents,
and pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite grains indicates that seawater
penetration is restricted in these sediments, possibly due to their rapid
burial, lower permeability, and the absence of residual hydrothermal
?ow. Pelagic layers, intercalated with the metalliferous sediments, record hiatuses in the hydrothermal activity. The Mn-rich horizons on
and within the pelagic sediments are likely derived from hydrothermal
plume fall-out, while those within the shallow metalliferous sediment
sequence, and their elevated copper concentrations, are probably the
result of precipitation at a radox front. Tilting of some of the sediments,
with dip decreasing up section, indicates syn-depositionary deformation, probably in response to rotation of the basement by faulting in the
TAG hydrothermal feld. Together, these metalliferous sediments may
present a resource potential in their own right, with a mixture of Cuand Zn-rich material dispersed over an area of several square kilometres, and deserve further investigation.
The formation of a ubiquitous and 2.5每3.5 m thick layer of jasper at
the top of the eSMS mounds, below the sediments, is unusual and has
not previously been reported from hydrothermally active SMS systems.
However, the jasper material has many textural similarities to minor
occurrences at modern hydrothermal vent sites, including the flamentous and sponge-like micro-textures that are possibly the result of
bacterial involvement (Juniper and Fouquet, 1988; Hannington and
Jonasson, 1992; Duhig et al., 1992; Little et al., 1999; Hofmann and
Farmer, 2000; Trewin and Knoll, 2000). The presence of overgrowths of
sulphides in the jasper, often comprising euhedral pyrite and minor
chalcopyrite, combined with the change in colour from dark red to a
lighter shade of red, with bleached mottled areas towards the base of
the layer, associated with a change from hematite to goethite, indicate
the infusion of late-stage, chemically reduced, sulphidic ?uids. It is
thought that jasper formation is a result of silica precipitation from lowtemperature, di?use hydrothermal venting that has resulted in silicifcation of pre-existing iron-rich sediments (Alt, 1988; Sto?ers et al.,
1993). This implies that the formation of the thick jasper layers at the
TAG eSMS sites is a result of late stage, low-temperature, hydrothermal
?uid ?ow, focused on the summits of the waning hydrothermal systems.
The thickness and relative impermeability of the jasper layer is also
signifcant. The rapid transition into fresh, unoxidised pyrite and
chalcopyrite (and copper-rich) massive sulphides immediately below
the jasper layer suggests it acts as an impermeable barrier to the ingress
of seawater. The jasper layer bears some resemblance to occurrences of
silica encountered below the active TAG mound, in stockwork breccia
at depth (Fig. 15B; Humphris et al., 1995). It is also similar to the siliceous layer found above a copper-rich zone, deep within the sedimenthosted Bent Hill deposit (Fig. 15C; Zierenberg et al., 1998). The IRINA
II Mound at the ultramafc-hosted Logatchev vent site (Fig. 15D) also
has a silicifed sulphide breccia cap, although the interior of the deposit
is heterogeneous with sulphide formation restricted to the immediate
vicinity of the active vent sites and the majority of the mound＊s interior
being composed of altered, chloritised and serpentinised ultramafc
lithologies (Augustin, 2007; Petersen et al., 2009). Similar jasper materials are found elsewhere, in the geological record. For example, in
the Iberian Pyrite Belt they are considered vectors to massive sulphide
ore deposits, especially when the jasper is altered into grey chert containing pyrite and chlorite, which grow at the expense of hematite,
attesting to the contribution of reduced ?uids at elevated temperatures
(Barriga and Kerrich, 1984; Barriga and Fyfe, 1988; Carvalho et al.,
1999).
At Southern and Rona mounds, the japers transition in to a weakly
mineralised zone of silicifed breccia. The brecciation is interpreted to
result from volume reduction and collapse, possibly related to anhydrite dissolution at depth. Below the breccia, the deposits are composed
of low-porosity, massive sulphide with little or no gangue material. The
upper 3每6 m of the massive sulphides contains minor amounts of barite,
indicating interaction with seawater at temperatures up to ‵250 ∼C
(Jamieson et al., 2016). At Rona mound, a shallower zinc-rich zone also
occurs (at 7.4每9 mbsf). Copper concentrations generally increase with
depth where primary pyrite is overgrown, and cut by, chalcopyrite
veins, interpreted as evidence for later mobilisation and recrystallisation of copper at elevated temperatures above 300 ∼C. This is probably a
result of high-temperature hydrothermal ?uids mobilizing copper upwards as the mounds grow, similar to that proposed for the active TAG
mound (Humphris et al., 1995). Whether higher grades of copper
continue below 12.5 mbsf, or are restricted to the depths encountered
here, remains unknown.
In contrast to the active TAG mound (Humphris et al., 1995), where
anhydrite dominates the interior, anhydrite is not present in any of the
eSMS cores. This is expected for hydrothermally extinct deposits where
the retrograde solubility of anhydrite at temperatures below 140 ∼C
(Blount and Dickson, 1969) causes it to dissolve once hydrothermal
?uids cease circulating. The inward dipping, arcuate faults that dissect
the oldest and largest eSMS mounds (e.g. Southern, Rona and Double
mounds) are unusual in that they curve around the mounds, have a low
angle (20每30∼), and form graben structures centred on the summits of
the mounds. We interpret their presence as the result of volume reduction and collapse within the mounds caused by anhydrite dissolution, 
and is probably a common phenomenon in the older eSMS deposits where interior temperatures have fallen below 140 ∼C 
(Humphriset al., 1995; Petersen et al., 2000). Shinkai Mound and the New
Mounds, which have little pelagic sediment cover and host many
standing but inactive chimneys, do not show these features, and we
speculate volume reduction within these younger mounds has not
commenced due to higher temperatures maintaining the stability of
anhydrite. The signifcance of the curved faults is in terms of the potential for seawater ingress and alteration of the sulphide at depth. As
we did not drill on the ?anks of the mounds, this possibility remains
untested.
5.2. Estimates of the mass of the sulphide resource
The combined geological and seismic data for each of the eSMS
mounds indicate the deposits extend to depths of up to ‵200 mbsf
where they comprise a layered structure with higher velocity layers
(zones 1 and 2) embedded in a lower velocity host (zone 3). The following description is based on Southern and Shinkai mounds: Zone 1
has rapidly increasing seismic velocity with an average of 5.4 km/s that
extends to ‵100 mbsf and is consistent with the presence of a mainly
sulphide-rich ore body of the type intersected by our drilling. Zone 2
also has a moderately high average velocity, of 4.75 ㊣ 0.3 km/s, and
extends to ‵200 mbsf. We interpret it as a ＆stockwork＊ composed of a
mixture of lithologies potentially including altered basalt, silica and
sulphide (e.g. similar to the TAG active mound stockwork). Zone 3 has a
lower average velocity of 3.65 ㊣ 0.2 km/s and is consistent with an
altered and brecciated basaltic host.
We can estimate the proportion of lithologies forming the di?erent
zones identifed from the seismic model by assuming a mixture of pure
end-member lithologies, (sediment, sulphide (pyrite), jasper (silica) and
chloritised altered basalt) using their seismic velocities measured on
core material recovered from the SMS (Table 5). For example, the
proportion of massive sulphide (XS) in zone 1, can be estimated as:
X (V V )/(V V ) S 1 Z S Z = (1)
where: XS = proportion of massive sulphide; VS = P-wave velocity of
massive sulphide (6.1 km/s); VZ = average P-wave velocity of nonsulphide phase; V1 = average P-wave velocity of zone 1 (5.4 km/s)
Although we do not know the actual composition of zone 1, we can
estimate the maximum and minimum proportions of sulphide by assuming the non-sulphide component is either the highest velocity (silica) or lowest velocity (water-flled pore space) material encountered
during the drilling. This assumption yields an envelope for the upper
and lower estimates of the sulphide present, respectively.
Assuming the non-sulphide in zone 1 is silica (i.e. 4.5 km/s), then
the estimated proportion of sulphide is 56%. Alternatively, assuming
the non-sulphide is pore-water flled porosity, (i.e. 1.5 km/s) then the
proportion of sulphide is 85%. Alternatively, assuming the non-sulphide is altered basalt, (i.e. 3.47 km/s), which we did not encounter in
the drilling but that surrounds the eSMS mounds, then the proportion of
sulphide is 73% (Table 6). Hence in zone 1, the proportion of massive
sulphide may vary between 56 and 85% by volume. The drill core indicates that silica, in the form of jasper, occurs as a 3每5 m-thick layer at
the top of the massive sulphide and then decreases rapidly where it
appears to be absent 3 m below the base of the jasper layer, whereas
open pore space remains present. In addition, and in contrast to the
active TAG mound, there was an absence of anhydrite in the drill core
(i.e. having already dissolved), meaning the non-sulphide component is
most likely to represent water-flled porosity in a brecciated massive
sulphide layer. Hence the proportion of massive sulphide in zone 1 is
likely skewed towards the higher-end of the estimated range.
Repeating this for zone 2 (with an average P-wave velocity,
V3 = 4.75 km/s), and assuming options for the non-sulphide as either
(a) silica, (b) pore water, and/or (c) altered basalt, yields the following
proportions of sulphide: (a) 16%, (b) 71%, (c) 49%, respectively
(Table 6). Using all three non-sulphide options yield signifcantly less
sulphide than in zone 1. Porosity in zone 2 might be assumed to be
closer to zero, because it is greater that 100 mbsf, making the upper
estimate of the amount of sulphide unrealistic. Instead, the concentration of sulphide is likely to be closer to the lower estimate of 16%, given
that a silicifed stockwork containing up to 46% pyrite was encountered
during drilling beneath the TAG active mound (Humphris et al., 1995).
While our calculations suggest this could be achieved for our eSMS
deposits assuming a 1:1 mixture of altered basalt and silica as the nonsulphide matrix to a sulphide breccia, it is also possible to reproduce the
average velocity in zone 2 from a barren mixture of 26% silica and 74%
altered basalt (i.e. no sulphide).
While our new data do not permit predictions about the chemical
composition, or metal tenor, of the interior of the mounds at depths
greater than 12.5 mbsf, the model does predict the total mass of sulphide in the eSMS mounds in the TAG hydrothermal feld (excluding
MIR Zone and Shimmering Mound).
The volume of zone 1 comprises the volume of the eSMS mound
(calculated from its bathymetric expression above the surrounding
sea?oor) plus the volume of an inverted cone that extends below the
base of the mound. Similarly, for zone 2 we can calculate its volume as
an inverted cone extending below the base of the mound, minus the
volume of zone 1 that lies below the base of the mound. Applying the
same geometry to the other eSMS mounds in the area, we can also make
an estimate of the total mass of sulphide in the ore body and stockwork
(Table 7).
Zone 1 for Shinkai Mound has an estimated volume of 1.2 million
cubic metres, including the topographic expression of the mound itself,
and for Southern Mound it is 2.4 million cubic metres. Zone 2 for
Shinkai Mound has an estimated volume of 2.5 million cubic metres
and for Southern Mound it is 3.2 million cubic metres. Assuming the
lower limit for sulphide contents, based on the minimum P-wave velocities and thickness of the zones, and a density of pure sulphide of
5 g/cc, then we estimate the total mass of sulphide for zone 1 (56%) in
and below Shinkai Mound of 3.1 Mt, and for Southern Mound of 9.4 Mt.
This assumes the sulphide in zone 1 is in the form of a silicifed breccia,
similar to that encountered during the TAG active mound drilling
(Humphris et al., 1995). Zone 2 is devoid of any sulphide, if we assume
it is and composed of silicifed altered basalt. Assuming the upper limit
for sulphide content (85%), based on the maximum P-wave velocities
and thicknesses of the zones in and below the mounds, yields an estimated sulphide mass for zone 1 of 5.9 Mt for Shinkai Mound and
17.7 Mt for Southern Mound. Zone 2 has a maximum sulphide content
of 71%, which yields corresponding masses of sulphide of 9.7 Mt and
12.6 Mt for Shinkai and Southern mounds, respectively. In this scenario,
zone 1 and 2 would be composed of massive sulphide breccia with open
pore space, and zone 2 having a larger proportion of void space than
zone 1, which is unlikely given its depth below the sea?oor.
We propose a more realistic scenario for the mass of sulphide, based
on a mean value for the seismically determined P-wave velocities and
thicknesses of the zones, our shallow drilling results and drawing a
comparison with lithologies encountered during the full penetration
during drilling of the active TAG mound (Humphris et al., 1995). In this
scenario, we assume zone 1 is composed of brecciated massive sulphide
with open pore space at the top (as encountered by our drilling), with
an increase in silica flling the open pore space with depth (as encountered by the active TAG mound drilling 每 Humphris et al., 1995)
but with anhydrite being absent. This yields an average proportion of
sulphide in zone 1 of 70%, corresponding to a mass of 3.2 Mt and
10.5 Mt in Shinkai and Southern mounds, respectively. Zone 2 we assume is composed entirely of a silicifed breccia and disseminated sulphide forming a stockwork (as encountered by the TAG drilling 每
Humphris et al., 1995), but with an average proportion of sulphide of
only 16% (compared with 46% beneath the active TAG mound)
yielding 2.0 Mt and 2.6 Mt of sulphide in zone 2 at Shinkai and
Southern mounds, respectively. Together, zones 1 and 2 yield a total
mass of sulphide at Shinkai and Southern mounds of 6.3 Mt and
15.8 Mt. This is approximately 3 times greater than the mass of sulphide
calculated from the topographic expression of the eSMS mounds alone
(Table 7 and Fig. 16). It also indicates that mounds with a radius of
50 m or less are likely to represent deposits of < 1 Mt.
Extrapolating these results to the other eSMS mounds studied in the
TAG area, our estimates yield a range in total tonnage of sulphide in
and below the mounds of between 14 Mt and 54 Mt. Our preferred estimate, based on the assumptions above, yields a total tonnage of 26 Mt.
While these estimates are considerably larger than previous estimates
for the TAG massive sulphide deposits, we stress that there remains an
absence of information about the metal grades below 12.5 mbsf at the
eSMS deposits we have studied. It remains possible that the subsurface
sulphides are barren pyrite, and as such their resource potential is
minimal.

Conclusions
Sea?oor massive sulphides provide a modern analogue of volcanic
massive sulphide deposits found throughout the geological record. They
also have the potential to be a resource for base metals, especially
copper, zinc and precious metals such as gold and silver. This paper
brings together four years of data collection including survey design,
instrument development, deployment across 10 weeks of ship time, and
deep-sea?oor drilling. The geological and geophysical data and their
interpretation described here form, to date, the most detailed, threedimensional characterisation of hydrothermally extinct, sea?oor massive sulphide deposits, hosted by volcanic systems, at a slow spreading
mid-ocean ridge. This research clearly demonstrates a distinct difference between the structure and composition of hydrothermally active
SMS deposits on slow spreading ridges, and hydrothermally extinct
eSMS systems. The main differences are found in the change from active
SMS deposits, where anhydrite dominates an interior comprising massive sulphide overlying a silicifed altered basalt-hosted sulphide
stockwork (Humphris et al., 1995), compared with the eSMS deposits
that have a 1每5 m thick carapace of iron-rich oxide sediments overlying
a 3每6 m thick impermeable silica cap that in turn overlies a dense
massive sulphide ore body of about 100 m thickness, that overlays a
moderate density silicifed sulphide stockwork zone, surrounded by
lower density host rocks of altered basalt. Our combined geological and
geophysics data show that the main ore body is composed of brecciated
and partially silicifed sulphide that extends to a sub-sea?oor depth of
about 100 m with an average sulphide content of about 70% that increases with depth. The underlying stockwork extends to another 100 m
depth and likely comprises ‵16% sulphide in a silicifed matrix that
grades into an altered basalt host rock. These data indicate a resource
that is 2 to 5 times larger than that predicted from the surface expression of the deposits alone. This estimate is even larger if the metal
rich sediment-aprons that surround the eSMS mounds are included.
Our results also give insights into the processes leading to the formation of the eSMS deposits, and especially those that occur at the
closing stages of the hydrothermal cycle. High-resolution AUV-bathymetry (0.5 m resolution) and RUV HyBIS surveys show that the eSMS
mounds have partially collapsed, probably due to anhydrite dissolution
and the resulting volumetric contraction within the main ore body. The
upper ore body is protected from seawater penetration by late stage,
low-temperature hydrothermal silicifcation of iron-rich hydrothermal
sediments, generating a silica cap. Remobilisation and recrystallisation
of the massive sulphide, especially the copper-rich phases such as
chalcopyrite, have led to an enrichment in the upper ten metres of the
ore body, but the impact on metal tenor at depth remains unknown.
The implication of this work is a signifcant upward revision of the
sulphide volume for eSMS deposits at slow-spreading ridges. Whereas a
global database of SMS deposits indicates the majority are relatively
small (Hannington et al., 2011), this study indicates that many of these
are actually larger and extend sub-sea?oor. Depending on their, as yet
undetermined, metal tenor at depth, these deposits may represent more
economically attractive targets than their resource estimates, based on
the volume of the mound alone, would suggest.
Abstract〞We describe the development of feedback control for 
autonomous underwater gliders. Feedback is introduced to make 
the glider motion robust to disturbances and uncertainty. Our 
focus is on buoyancy-propelled, fixed-wing gliders with attitude 
controlled by means of active internal mass redistribution. We 
derive a nonlinear dynamic model of a nominal glider complete 
with hydrodynamic forces and coupling between the vehicle and 
the movable internal mass. We use this model to study stability 
and controllability of glide paths and to derive feedback control 
laws. For our analysis, we restrict to motion in the vertical plane 
and consider linear control laws. For illustration, we apply our 
methodology to a model of our own laboratory-scale underwater 
glider.

I. INTRODUCTION 
IN RELATION to existing methods of ocean sampling, 
autonomous underwater gliders offer a host of technical 
advantages: superior spatial and temporal measurement density, 
longer duration missions, and greater operational flexibility. 
These advantages are expected to be greatest when multiple 
gliders are operated cooperatively in a network. The underwater 
glider concept, initially conceived by Henry Stommel 
, has motivated the development of several operational 
gliders, including the SLOCUM glider, the ※Spray§ glider 
and the ※Seaglider§. These are all buoyancy-propelled, 
fixed-winged gliders which shift internal ballast to control 
attitude. Each has many useful features ranging from low 
operational and capital costs, and low noise and vibration to 
high reliability due to simplicity of design, minimal reliance on 
battery power, and low vulnerability of actuator mechanisms 
to the harsh effects of seawater. 
In order for the advantages in ocean sampling using underwater 
gliders to be fully realized, an accurate and reliable glider 
control system should be developed. Most importantly, the use 
of feedback control provides a measure of robustness to uncertainty 
and disturbances. In this paper, we derive a nonlinear 
dynamic model and describe the first steps in development of 
model-based control for a class of underwater gliders, namely 
those with fixed external surfaces which can control buoyancy 
and center of gravity (CG). We emphasize an approach that 
is widely applicable rather than exclusively vehicle-specific; 
accordingly, this work complements the efforts on SLOCUM, 
Spray and Seaglider. 
On SLOCUM, the ballast tanks are configured within the vehicle 
to provide the proper pitching moment during upwards and 
downwards glides. A sliding battery mass is used for 
fine adjustments in pitch and roll. Sensors measure depth, pitch, 
roll, and compass heading. Vehicle position at the surface is determined 
through GPS fix. The pitch angle, an assumed angle 
of attack, and a vertical speed computed from depth measurements 
are used to estimate the horizontal speed of the glider. The 
glider control system periodically checks the glider attitude and 
adjusts the position of the sliding battery mass. The timing of 
mass position adjustments can be changed depending on glider 
performance during the glide. Switching between downwards 
and upwards glides is performed open loop, i.e., the ballast is 
changed and the sliding mass is moved to a new position. 
Sensing and control on other gliders is similar. For example, 
Spray performs active control of pitch and roll every 40 s 
using measured pitch and heading errors. In the case of pitch, 
a low-gain proportional control law is used, and in the case of 
heading, proportional plus integral control is used. 
Our program initiated in this paper to develop a model-based, 
feedback control design methodology is intended to improve 
upon the currently implemented glider control strategies. A systematic 
design methodology that provides control in the full 
state-space is expected to make it possible to design glider controllers 
that require less experimentation and tuning and provide 
more robustness to fouling, payload changes and other uncertainties 
as compared to current techniques. Additionally, with 
a model-based approach, a dynamic observer can be designed 
to estimate states such as glider velocity. These estimated states 
could then be used to determine horizontal glider motion instead 
of the current methods which rely on assumptions of constant 
angle of attack. A model-based approach may also prove useful 
in determining optimal glider motions. 
The dynamic glider model we derive here describes a glider 
with simple body and wing shape. Control is applied to two point 
masses inside the vehicle: the first point mass has variable mass 
but fixed position while the second point mass has fixed mass but 
variable position relative to the center of buoyancy. One control 
input changes the mass of the stationary point and another control 
input vector corresponds to the force applied to the movable 
mass. The model describes the nonlinear coupling between the 
vehicle and the shifting and changing mass. Analysis and control 
law design is performed for the dynamics specialized to the vertical 
plane. Continuous feedback laws are developed. However, 
when energy is at a premium, we envision a scenario in which one 
might occasionally and temporarily turn off the active feedback 
control routine (including sensors), e.g., during periods of relative 
calm or when tight control is less critical. 
The model we derive, although simplified, does capture 
the essential dynamic features of underwater gliding. The 
simplicity allows for development of general control design 
strategies. These strategies along with the insights gained from 
the development are expected to be relevant to the design of 
control laws for the more complex operational gliders. Feedback 
provides robustness to uncertainty, and this uncertainty 
may include unmodeled dynamics. 
Specialization of the glider dynamics to the vertical plane 
constitutes a first step toward a systematic understanding and 
methodology for complete glider control design. In restricting 
to the vertical plane, we ignore, for example, challenges associated 
with currents traveling transverse to the motion of the vehicle. 
Analysis of tail volume requirements, heading corrections 
and the capabilities of shifting mass in this context will be next 
steps in developing methodology to meet these challenges. The 
successful SLOCUM glider experiments at LEO-15 during the 
summer of 2000 suggest promise for this program. In these experiments, 
SLOCUM performed excellent tracking in the presence 
of strong (transverse) currents. 
Throughout the paper, we illustrate our results on a model 
of a small, laboratory-scale underwater glider called ROGUE 
(Remotely Operated Gliding Underwater Experiment) that we 
have built and that we operate in a freshwater tank and pool, see 
Fig. 1. In the first version of this glider, CG position is controlled 
by shifting a lead weight inside the vehicle. In its most recent 
incarnation, ROGUE controls buoyancy and CG position 
by means of a distributed array of independently actuated ballast 
tanks (syringes). 
In related and forthcoming work with colleagues, we address 
issues in optimal path planning for underwater glidersand in 
coordinating control for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles. 
There is a great deal of literature on dynamics, stability, and 
control of airplanes, including [11], [12], [13]每[16], which is 
clearly of interest in the study of underwater gliders. We note, 
however, that added mass forces, variable buoyancy and controlled 
mass redistribution, which play a central role in our study 
of underwater gliders, are not typically relevant for airplanes and 
therefore not included in the airplane literature. 
In Section II, we derive the equations of motion for a 
buoyancy-driven, fixed-wing underwater glider. Controllability 
and observability of steady glide paths in the vertical plane are 
studied in Section III. Linear control laws are developed in 
Section IV for stabilizing these glide paths in the presence of 
disturbances. A simulation of the controlled glider modeled to 
resemble ROGUE is also presented. We give final remarks in 
Section V. 
II. GLIDER DYNAMICS 
The variables used in this paper are defined in Table I. 
A. Equations of Motion in 3-D 
We model the underwater glider as a rigid body with fixed 
wings (and tail) immersed in a fluid with buoyancy control and 
controlled internal moving mass. We take the hull to be ellipsoidal 
with wings and tail attached so that the center of buoyancy 
(CB) is at the center of the ellipsoid. We assign a coordinate 
frame fixed on the vehicle body to have its origin at the CB and 
its axes aligned with the principle axes of the ellipsoid. Let body 
axis 1 lie along the long axis of the vehicle (positive in the direction 
of the nose of the glider), let body axis 2 lie in the plane 
of the wings and body axis 3 point in the direction orthogonal 
to the wings as shown in Fig. 2. 
The total stationary mass, , (also referred to as body mass) 
is the sum of three terms: is a fixed mass that is uniformly 
distributed throughout the ellipsoid, is a fixed point mass that may 
be offset from the CB, and is the variable ballast point mass which 
is fixed in location at the CB. The vector from the CB to the point
mass is . The vector from the CB to the center of mass of the stationary mass is 
The moving internal point mass is . The vector 
describes the position of this mass with respect to the CB at time . 
The total mass of the vehicle is then 
The mass of the displaced fluid is denoted and we define 
so that the vehicle is negatively (positively) 
buoyant if is negative (positive). The different masses and 
position vectors are illustrated in Fig. 3. 
 DEFINITION OF VARIABLES 
Let denote the inertia matrix, with respect to the body 
frame, for the uniformly distributed mass . Define the operator 
so that for a vector , 
Equivalently, for vector i.e., the operator maps a vector to the (skew-symmetric) matrix 
representation of the vector cross product operator. The inertia 
matrix for the stationary (body) mass expressed with respect 
to body frame coordinates is 
Since the variable ballast mass is a point mass located at 
the CB, it does not contribute to , and in particular is a 
constant. 
The orientation of the glider is given by the rotation matrix 
. maps vectors expressed with respect to the body frame 
into inertial frame coordinates. The position of the glider 
is the vector from the origin of the inertial frame to 
the origin of the body frame (vehicle CB) as shown in Fig. 4. 
The vehicle moves through the fluid with translational velocity 
and angular velocity , expressed with respect to the body frame. [Note that we have 
diverged from the notation typical of the submarine literature 
where and . The notation that we use here is taken from texts in classical mechanics such as 
[17] and is more convenient for the derivation and analysis.] In 
this notation, the kinematics of the glider are given by 
Fig. 4. Glider position and orientation variables. 
Let  represent the total translational momentum of the 
vehicle-fluid system and  the total angular momentum of 
the system about the inertial coordinate origin, all expressed 
with respect to the inertial frame. Let represent the total 
momentum of the movable point mass with respect to the inertial frame. 
Then Newton＊s laws state that where is a unit vector pointing in the direction of gravity,
is an external force applied to the system, and is a pure
external torque. These external forces and torques include those
due to gravity and buoyancy; however, gravity is included explicitly
in the third set of equations as it is the only external
force acting on the movable point mass. The force is a
force applied from the vehicle body onto the point mass (a control
force). All vectors are expressed with respect to the inertial
frame. The vector locates the point of application of the force
with respect to the inertial coordinate frame.
Let be the momentum of the vehicle-fluid system expressed
with respect to the body frame. Let be the total
angular momentum about the origin of the body frame. Let
represent the point mass momentum with respect to the body
frame. Then
Differentiating (4)每(6) and using the kinematic expressions (2) 
and (1) gives (7) 
Substituting (3) into (7) for the rate of change of inertial momenta 
gives the following dynamic equations in body coordinates:

total kinetic energy of the glider-fluid system. The kinetic energy

expressed in body coordinates. Given that the velocity of
relative to the body frame is , we compute
The kinetic energy of the movable point mass is then computed 
to be 
Kirchhoff [18] showed that the kinetic energy of an unbounded 
volume of ideal fluid due to the motion of an immersed 
rigid body takes the form where is the added mass matrix, is the added inertia 
matrix, and is the added cross term. These matrices depend 
upon the external shape of the body and the density of the fluid. 
This form of kinetic energy comes from a potential flow solution 
in which the fluid is assumed to be inviscid, incompressible, 
irrotational and motionless at infinity. We incorporate viscous 
effects into the model as external forces and torques (lift and 
drag) below. 
We assume that at low angle of attack, the contribution of the 
wings is dominated by lift and drag forces. Thus, we make the 
simplifying assumption that the added mass and inertia terms 
can be computed solely from the vehicle hull. These assumptions 
are not so critical for the analysis in this paper, especially 
since it is expected that feedback control will provide robustness 
to unmodeled dynamics. Nonetheless, it may be of interest in 
future work to consider more detailed modeling of added mass 
associated with the hull plus wings using methods such as from 
computational fluid dynamics. 
The total vehicle fluid kinetic energy is 
computed to be 
We can then compute momenta as
Since the vehicle hull is ellipsoidal (we neglect the wings in this 
instance), and are diagonal and . Let and . Define

Then,Inverting the relationships (13) then gives the body velocities in
terms of the body momenta: 
To get the equations of motion in terms of body velocities, we 
differentiate (14) with respect to time. We assume that buoyancy 
is changed in a symmetric way (e.g., ballast is pumped on and 
off board in streams with the appropriate symmetry) so that there 
is negligible associated thrust or moment on the glider. Let the 
ballast control input be defined as 
Differentiating (14) then gives

momenta and velocity, the complete equations of motion 
for the underwater glider moving in three-dimensional space are

B. Equations of Motion in the Vertical Plane 
We now specialize the model to the vertical plane, the 每 
plane in inertial coordinates and the 每 plane in body coordinates. 
Accordingly, 
where is pitch angle. 
The equations of motion (18) for the gliding vehicle restricted 
to the vertical plane become

viscous moment as shown in Fig. 5. These forces and moment 
are modeled as 
where the s are constant coefficients. This model is a standard 
one, derived using airfoil theory and potential flow calculations 
and then verified using experimental observations, see for example 
[12]. The method for determination of the coefficients 
is described in Section III-C. 
As shown in Fig. 5, we denote the glide path angle by where

We will typically specify a glide path by desired glide path angle 
and desired speed . We define inertial coordinates 
such that coincides with the desired path: 
Then, measures the vehicle＊s perpendicular distance to the 
desired path. We define two gliding objectives: 
GO1 
The objective is to control only the direction and speed 
of the vehicle＊s glide path. In this case we need not 
consider and at all. 
GO2 
The objective is to control gliding along a prescribed 
line (see Fig. 6). In this case we will include (but 
exclude ) in our analysis and we aim to make . 
The dynamics of the state are 
In the above model, the movable point mass can be controlled 
in all directions (2 degrees of freedom in the planar case). However, 
it may sometimes be the case that control over the CG location 
is restricted, for example, a battery may be shifted in a 
limited way. For the planar case, this might translate into a movable 
point mass with only one degree of freedom. To model this 
we consider the case in which is fixed ( ), i.e., we 
can only move the point mass in the direction.then

III. CONTROLLABILITY OF STEADY GLIDE PATHS 
In this section, we compute steady glide paths. We then study 
controllability and observability of these glide paths.  
A. Gliding Equilibria 
We prescribe a desired glide path by specifying the desired 
, we see that we must choose glide path angle and the desired speed 
. We denote with subscript ※ § the value of all dynamic variables at 
the glide equilibria. 
To get the conditions for such planar gliding equilibria, 
we set the left hand side of (31) and (21)每(29) to zero. This gives 
or 
and . Note that 
which are all dependent on the equilibrium value of the variable
mass .
Since the drag model is valid only at small angles of attack, we 
take 
Given , (35) and (36) may be solved for . We can then
compute

gives a one-parameter family of solutions for .
First, we compute from (35) and (36). Note that these
equations reduce to
The first equation of (39) is a quadratic equation in . Provided
and , we have
Equation (40) may be solved for a realizable provided
Evaluating (41) for permissible values of in the range

Since the drag model is valid only at small angles of attack, we
take as the solution of (41) with smaller magnitude,
If , then we simply have

which are all dependent on the equilibrium value of the variable 
. In this case, for equilibria corresponding to vertical . flight ( ), 
the desired angle of attack is zero.

of (34). Since is the direction of gravity in body coordinates, 
is orthogonal to the direction of gravity and measures the vehicle＊s ※bottom-heaviness§ as 
shown in Fig. 7.

relevant choice of parameter than . In this case,

to satisfy condition (47) in general because this 
will require that be small. Since contributes to the vehicle＊s 
※bottom-heaviness§ at shallower glide path angles, satisfying 
condition (47) will affect stability of these other equilibria.

implies that and . In this case, condition (47) requires that .] 
B. Linearization 
We determine the linearization for the planar glider about a 
steady glide path. 
Let and let . Define 
Then the linearized system is 
(48) where and 
are defined as shown in (49) and (50), shown at 
the bottom of the next page. Here, 
where we have abbreviated as , etc., and
The notation indicates that the quantity is to be evaluated 
at the desired equilibrium. 
This linearization can be used to check features of a given 
vehicle design, e.g., to check stability or controllability of a desired 
glide path given a choice of vehicle design parameters. 
One can also use this linearization to help automate the design 
procedure. For example, consider a vehicle that has been fully 
designed but for a choice of the position of the movable mass 
for a given glide path. Application of the Routh criterion to the 
characteristic polynomial of the matrix gives conditions for 
stability of the glide path. These conditions can be written in 
terms of the free variable. would then be chosen for behavior 
with desired stability and would then be computed according to (46). 
C. Controllability and Observability 
In this section we describe controllability and observability 
of steady glide paths for a model of our experimental vehicle 
ROGUE. ROGUE has an ellipsoidal body with axes of length 
18, 12, and 6 in. The wings are symmetric airfoils from [21] for 
low Reynolds number. We note that the body and wings have not 
been designed for optimal gliding performance but rather in consideration 
of available facilities and other manufacturing constraints. 
Each wing has span of 28 inches with aspect ratio 9.3. 
The glider body, wings and tail are all machined from UHMW 
(ultra-high molecular weight) plastic. Mass and inertia properties 
were measured directly. Added mass and inertia properties 
can be found, for example, in [20]. Lift and drag for the body 
were found experimentally as described in [8]. Lift and drag for 
the wings were taken from the data in [19]. Lift for the body 
plus wings was then computed using Schrenk＊s method [21], 
and drag was computed as the sum of the drag on the wing and 
the body. The lift moment was approximated by taking into account 
the tail. The vehicle model parameters are given as follows: 
The first three masses, , , and were measured with a high 
degree of accuracy. The other terms have less precision because 
they are based on look up tables and approximation methods. 
Four steady glide paths are calculated using the method of 
Section III-A. The glide paths are at glide angles 30 , 45 , 
30 and 45 . We compute the glide path at 30 by choosing 
a desired glide speed m/s and a desired vertical location 
of the movable mass given by cm. This results 
in an equilibrium variable mass given by kg. The 
glide path at 45 is computed for these same values of 
and . The corresponding equilibrium speed for this glide is 
computed as m/s. Similarly, we computed the two steady upward glide paths, for 
the same value of and the same buoyant force magnitude, i.e., the value of is held 
constant. Recall that is the mass of the vehicle less the mass of the displaced fluid . 
The full description of each of the four glide paths is given in Table II. 
Local properties of these steady glide paths can be studied 
using the linearization of Section III-B. By plugging in the equilibrium 
values, we can examine the linearization for stability, 
controllability and observability. The four glide paths listed in 
Table II all have a relatively slow unstable mode. They are all, 
however, locally controllable. That is, and as given by (49) 
and (50), when evaluated at any of the four equilibria, satisfy 
the controllability rank condition. Note that the linearization includes 
the state meaning that controllability extends to the 
variable . Accordingly, we can successfully design a linear 
controller that will locally accomplish not only glide objective 
GO1 but also GO2. 
It is of interest to check the controllability rank condition in 
the case that the movable mass can only move in one direction 
(i.e., is fixed). To do this we have linearized the equations of 
motion for the single degree-of-freedom moving mass described 
at the very end of Section II. Again the new and matrices 
for this case, when evaluated at any of the above four glide paths, 
satisfy the controllability rank condition. Thus, it seems that at 
least for linear type control action, not much is lost in restricting 
the degrees of freedom of the movable mass from two to one. 
On the other hand, for large motions, such as switching from 
an upward to a downward glide path, care needs to be taken 
if restricting the degrees of freedom of the movable mass. For 
instance, while motion of the movable mass restricted to the 
direction would be sufficient for sawtooth maneuvers, motion 
restricted to the direction would not allow for both upward 
and downward glide motions. Because of the glider shape, mass 
motion restricted to the direction will also typically have 
more limited travel as compared to motion in the direction. 
The movable mass for ROGUE is approximately 1/6 of the 
vehicle displacement . This is of the same relative order as the 
movable mass in the gliders SLOCUM, Spray and Seaglider. 
Variations in this mass or its location will not in principle affect 
local controllability of a feasible glide path. In practice, however, 
there are clear tradeoffs associated with moving a large 
mass a short distance versus moving a small mass a large distance. 
For example, a large mass may be energetically expensive 
to move and the necessary motion control resolution required 
may be difficult to achieve. On the other hand, since only short 
travel would be required, there would be a smaller demand on 
vehicle volume. Variation in mass and location will also affect 
the range of feasible glide paths and the nature of the switching 
between them. The variable mass in ROGUE at the equilibrium 
described above is larger relative to vehicle displacement 
as compared to these other gliders. This mass controls glide 
speed; thus, for example, if significant vehicle load required designing 
for a smaller variable mass then maximum glide speed 
would be reduced. 
Observability of the linearized model about the four glide 
paths listed in Table II was also investigated. If GO1 is our objective, 
i.e., if we are interested in controlling only the direction 
and speed of the vehicle＊s glide path, then we need not measure 
. The nine-dimensional dynamic model (which excludes ) is completely observable 
with measurements limited to movable mass position ,and variable mass. In this case, 
pitch angle , pitch rate , linear velocity components and 
and the momentum of the movable mass, need not be 
sensed. Observability means that with the measurements of, 
and , a dynamic observer could be designed to give an estimate 
of the unmeasured states , , , , and .of course, is typically already measured and 
is not so hard to measure, so the real advantage is in the estimation of ,, 
and which are more difficult to measure. The nine-dimensional 
dynamic model is also completely observable with measurements 
limited to , (or ) and . Again this means that using these three measurement signals,
an observer could be designed to estimate the rest of the states. 
If GO2 is our objective, i.e., if we want to control the glider to 
a prescribed line in the plane, then we need a measurement of . 
Recall from (30) that depends on both depth , which is easily 
measured, and horizontal position , which is not so easily measured. 
The measurements , and , together with a measurement of (or alternatively , , and ), 
do not render observable. This means that without an initial condition measurement 
, the trajectory can not be computed. However, with an initial measurement of 
given say from a GPS fix taken when the glider is at the surface, the horizontal motion of 
the glider can be calculated, for example, by making use of the 
estimate of linear velocity from the observer. We note that this 
approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of horizontal 
motion determination over current methods which are based on 
assumptions of constant angle of attack, etc. For example, on 
SLOCUM, the horizontal motion of the glider during the glide 
is estimated from GPS fixes taken at the surface, measured pitch 
angle , an assumed angle of attack and vertical speed computed 
from depth measurements [6]. Similarly, on Spray, horizontal 
flight distance is calculated based on a constant pitch, heading 
and angle of attack to which the vehicle is being controlled [4]. 
IV. CONTROLLED PLANAR GLIDING 
In this section we demonstrate, in simulation, controlled 
gliding in the vertical plane by designing and testing a linear 
controller for the glide path moving 30 downward as described 
in Table II. Since the controller is linear, we expect that it 
should take initial conditions nearby to the 30 downward glide 
path. We demonstrate this result by starting the glider at the 
45 downward steady glide and using the linear controller to 
move it to the 30 downward glide solely by feedback. 
The controller is designed for the linearization about the 30 
downward glide using the LQR (linear quadratic regulator) 
method. This is a standard linear optimal control design method 
which produces a stabilizing control law that minimizes a cost 
function that is a weighted sum of the squares of the states and 
input variables. We assume that all of the states are available for 
feedback. If this were not the case, then, as described above, it 
is possible to design an estimator to determine the unmeasured 
states.
 The cost function to be minimized is defined as 
where and are state and control penalty matrices. and 
were chosen to ensure well-behaved dynamics and to prevent 
large motions in the movable mass position and variable mass 
that would exceed physical limitations. Taking into account real 
or desirable maximum state values, the states associated with 
vehicle and movable mass velocity and variable mass and pitch 
angle were weighted most heavily. No significant tuning was 
performed. The weight selections are given by 
The corresponding control law is where is computed
using MATLAB as the solution to the Riccati equation
given .
 In Figs. 8每10, we show a MATLAB simulation of the glider 
moving first along the 45 downward glide and then switching 
to the 30 downward glide path. This was accomplished by 
turning on the linear controller at seconds. In Fig. 8 we 
show the glide path, in Fig. 9 we show plots of position, pitch, 
linear and angular velocity as a function of time and in Fig. 10 
we show the position of the movable mass, the net buoyant force 
as well as the control inputs as a function of time. In these latter 
two figures we show the results of the controller as applied to 
the linear dynamic model and the results as applied to the nonlinear 
dynamic model. 
The figures show that the 45 downward glide path is in the 
region of attraction of the linear controller designed for the 30 
downward glide path. Furthermore, the transient is very well 
behaved. 
However, we do not expect that the upward equilibria would 
be in the region of attraction of a linear controller designed for 
a downward glide (and vice-versa). This means we would not 
want to use a pure linear feedback solution for switching in a 
sawtooth glide path. Instead, we could consider complementing 
the feedback law with a feedforward term which drives the movable 
mass and the variable mass in a predetermined way from 
initial to final condition. Alternatively, we can consider a nonlinear 
control design approach that would include feedback and 
may or may not include a feedforward term. A feedforward term 
would make it possible to introduce an optimal path between 
two different glides. 
Laboratory experiments of controlled gliding with ROGUE 
will be described in a future publication. 
V. FINAL REMARKS 
We plan to realize the results described in this paper as well 
as future control design developments on experimental gliders 
both of our own construction, e.g., ROGUE, and with our colleagues 
who build sea-worthy gliders, e.g., SLOCUM. 
Fig. 10. Simulation of movable mass, variable mass, and control inputs. 
In future work we intend to further develop the gliding control 
methodology by investigating nonlinear feedback control laws, 
feedforward control and path planning. We are already working 
with colleagues on optimal control theory that is applicable to 
underwater gliders [7] and that may be useful for path planning 
purposes. 
Other future directions include extending our work to gliding 
motion in the horizontal plane, e.g., waypoint following, and to 
glider network maneuvers. Work is already underway to develop 
decentralized control laws to produce underwater vehicles that 
school [9], [10], and these we hope to integrate with control of 
glider dynamics. In support of this effort, we are building an 
experimental, underwater test-bed for multiple-vehicle control 
[22]. Schooling fish function like an integrated sensing system 
and by emulating their traffic rules, we can hope to produce a 
network of gliders that can similarly serve as a fast and effective 
adaptive ocean sensing platform. River piracyâ€”the diversion of the headwaters of one stream into another oneâ€”can dramatically change the routing of water
and sediment, with a profound eect on landscape evolution. Stream piracy has been investigated in glacial environments,
but so far it has mainly been studied over Quaternary or longer timescales. Here we document how retreat of Kaskawulsh
Glacierâ€”one of Canadaâ€™s largest glaciersâ€”abruptly and radically altered the regional drainage pattern in spring 2016.We use
a combination of hydrological measurements and drone-generated digital elevation models to show that in late May 2016,
meltwater from the glacier was re-routed from discharge in a northward direction into the Bering Sea, to southward into
the Pacific Ocean. Based on satellite image analysis and a signal-to-noise ratio as a metric of glacier retreat, we conclude
that this instance of river piracy was due to post-industrial climate change. Rapid regional drainage reorganizations of this
type can have profound downstream impacts on ecosystems, sediment and carbon budgets, and downstream communities
that rely on a stable and sustained discharge. We suggest that the planforms of Slims and Kaskawulsh rivers will adjust
in response to altered flows, and the future Kaskawulsh watershed will extend into the now-abandoned headwaters of
Slims River and eventually capture the Kluane Lake drainage.
River piracy, the diversion of the headwaters of one stream
into another with a higher gradient1, can alter the location
of a drainage divide and dramatically change the routing
of water and sediment, with a profound eect on landscape
evolution24. Although some researchers have examined stream
piracy in glacial environments57, relatively little attention has been
given to proglacial drainage changes. Furthermore, previous studies
of river piracy have dealt with capture over Quaternary or longer
timescales, with no one, to our knowledge, having detailed the
phenomenon in the modern era. Herein, we document rapid river
piracy at the front of Kaskawulsh Glacier, Yukon (Fig. 1), which
occurred in May 2016.
The toe of Kaskawulsh Glacier lies at a drainage divide that
separates the Alsek River watershed, which drains to the North
Pacific Ocean, from the Yukon River watershed, which drains to
the Bering Sea. Prior to May 2016, some of the water flowing
from the toe of the glacier marked the headwaters of Kaskawulsh
River, a major tributary of Alsek River. The remainder of the water
issuing from the glacier flowed via Slims River into Kluane Lake,
the largest lake in Yukon and part of the Yukon River watershed.
Ongoing thinning and retreat of the glacier, caused by over a
century of climate warming812, triggered the river piracy, which was
geologically instantaneous and is likely to be permanent. Substantial
long-term hydrological and ecological impacts13,14 may be expected
as a result, including a reversal in outflow from Kluane Lake,
diminished outflow at the north end of the lake, and perhaps even
seasonal closure of the lake basin.
Recent history of Kaskawulsh Glacier and its terminal lakes
In the early Holocene, when the climate of southwest Yukon was
warmer than today, Kluane Lake discharged to the south towards
the Alsek River15. Kaskawulsh Glacier achieved itsmaximum extent
between 1717 and the mid-1750s1618. During this Little Ice Age
advance, sediment fromthe glacier deposited an outwash fan, which
raised the base level of a river that formerly drained south from
Kluane Lake (Fig. 1), perhaps through much of the Holocene19. By
the middle of the eighteenth century, the glacier completely blocked
this south-flowing river, initiating the north-flowing Slims River,
which rapidly built a delta and floodplain intoKluane Lake. The lake
rose about 12m above the 2006 datum and flowed over a debris fan
at the north end of the lake, rapidly returning the lake to its present
level15,19. Kaskawulsh Glacier began to retreat in the nineteenth
century, with retreat accelerating in the late twentieth and early
twenty-first centuries. Between 1956 and 2007, for example, the
glacier retreated 655m (ref. 9). Roe et al.12 recently developed
a method to test a glacier's retreat against the null hypothesis
that retreat was due to natural climate variability. Applying this
analysis to theKaskawulshGlacier (seeMethods and Supplementary
Fig. 1), we find there is only a 0.5% chance that retreat over the
past centuryand by extension, the observed piracycould have
happened under a constant climate. We therefore conclude that
retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacier is attributable to observed warming
over the industrial era.
Recent retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacier has been accompanied
by the growth of terminal lakes, the largest of which we name`Slims Lake' and `Kaskawulsh Lake' (Fig. 2). Outflow from Slims
Lake has historically been northward into Kluane Lake via Slims
River, whereas outflow from Kaskawulsh Lake has historically been
southward to Alsek River via Kaskawulsh River (Fig. 1). A 1956
aerial photograph9 shows a small Slims Lake on the west side of the
glacier terminus. Only isolated ponds are visible in 1972 and 1980,
with no lake at all in 1990 (Fig. 2). However, by 2000, Slims Lake
had grown to 1.1106 m2, and by 2015 its area had increased more
than threefold to 3.9106 m2 (Fig. 2b,h). ByAugust 2016 (Fig. 2b,i),
Slims Lake had partially drained, its area decreasing to 1.0106 m2,
stranding the outlet of Slims River 17m above the level of the
remnant water body.
The earliest Landsat scene (2 September 1972) shows a small
(1.1106 m2) Kaskawulsh Lake at the east margin of the glacier
terminus (Fig. 2). The lake expanded to1.9106 m2 by 2010, and
to2.7106 m2 by 2015. By early July 2016, its size was three times
that in 1982 (3.3106 m2).
Drainage reorganization in 2016
Although the Slims River gauge record has gaps (Fig. 3g), a clear
reduction in river level is apparent in May 2016. Normal diurnal
fluctuations ended with an abrupt four-day drop in river level
commencing on 26 May 2016. Over the remainder of the summer
of 2016, the level of Slims River was 0.71.0m below the average for
those days. Our acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements at
the Slims River bridge on 3 September 2016, indicated a discharge of
11m3 sô€€€1, less than that reported following the 1970 (21m3 sô€€€1)
diversion. Although we have no measurements immediately prior
to the 2016 piracy, pre-diversion flows of 130m3 sô€€€1 have been
reported for 197020.
The reduction of Slims River flow has had substantial eects at
Kluane Lake. The lake had a record minimum water level in early
May 2016 (Fig. 3ac), about 0.1mbelow its previously recorded low
inMay 2015. By the time of its normal seasonal peak (early August),
the lake was 1.7m below its long-term mean level and 1m below
its lowest recorded level for that time of year. The lowering ofKluane
Lake in 2016 equates to a volumetric reduction of0.67 km3 relative
to the historic average.
Alsek River discharge (Fig. 3df) fluctuated around the historic
mean until early July 2016, after which it rose sharply and fluctuated
around the historic maximum level for that time of year, at times
exceeding it by 1 m. The peak discharge in 2016 occurred on
20 July (1,470m3 sô€€€1), which is nearly as high as any previously
recorded peak flow (1,550m3 sô€€€1, 13 July, 1989) and 87% higher
than the average peak discharge during the 41-yr period of record
(783m3 sô€€€1). The elevated discharge was probably the result of
the emptying of the eastern part of Slims Lake and lowering of
its western part, with the consequent re-routing of water from
Slims River into Kaskawulsh River. By October 2016, Alsek River
discharge had dropped to its historic mean, reflecting the reduction
in discharge from glacier melt at the end of the summer.
About 15mm of rain fell at Haines Junction on 2 May 2016,
but there was little other precipitation during the first half of
2016 (Supplementary Fig. 2). It is therefore unlikely that rainfall
contributed significantly to the mid-summer increase inAlsek River
discharge. Meteorological records from Haines Junction and the
Kaskawulsh Glacier nunatak indicate that mean daily temperatures
during the period JanuaryApril 2016 were, respectively, 4.3 C
and 3.6 C warmer than the 20072016 decadal means for the
same three-month period (Supplementary Fig. 2), which itself was
probably the warmest decade of the past century21. At Haines
Junction,which is 300mlower than the glacier terminus,mean daily
temperatures were above freezing almost continuously after mid-
March, approximately one month earlier than the decadal mean.
At the nunatak, which is 1,000m higher than the terminus, the
main period of above-freezing conditions started in early May,
1.5 weeks earlier than normal, and air temperatures were
unusually warm immediately before the drop in the level of Slims
River (Supplementary Fig. 2). It thus seems likely that Kaskawulsh
Glacier experienced unusually high surface melt in the spring of
2016, which lead to development of an ice-walled canyon (Fig. 4
and Supplementary Fig. 3) and increased flow in Kaskawulsh and
Alsek rivers.
The ice-walled channel that was established across dead ice at the
terminus of Kaskawulsh Glacier (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3)
was rapidly enlarged by meltwater and localized collapse of the
channel walls in the summer of 2016, resulting in the 17mlowering
of Slims Lake. Even if the current canyon walls were to collapse and
temporarily block the flow of meltwater into Kaskawulsh Lake, the
blockage could not pond water in Slims Lake to the level required
to re-establish Slims River. For example, at transect AA0 near the
upstream end of the canyon (Fig. 4), the channel floor is at785m
a.s.l. For an ice blockage to raise water levels to reconnect to Slims
River (head at 805m a.s.l.), Slims Lake would need to be >20m
deep, which is more than the height of the canyon walls (Fig. 4b).
Only a re-advance of Kaskawulsh Glacier could block the channel
and refill Slims Lake, but this is very unlikely given recent and
current climate trends. We therefore conclude that the drainage
change is permanent.
Previous workers19 had predicted the capture of Slims River by
Kaskawulsh River, although they were unable to predict when, or
how rapidly, that change might happen. These predictions were
based, in part, on the fact that Kaskawulsh River has amuch steeper
gradient than Slims Riverthe uppermost reach of Kaskawulsh
River has a gradient of 6.1mkmô€€€1, almost five times that of
upper Slims River (1.3mkmô€€€1, Fig. 5). Furthermore, the surface
of Kaskawulsh Lake is approximately 50m lower than that of
Slims Lake (755m versus 805m a.s.l. in September 2016), and also
approximately 25m lower than that of Kluane Lake (780m a.s.l.
in September 2016).
Implications of drainage reorganization
The piracy of Slims River has five important downstream
implications. First, the level of Kluane Lake has fallen and may
fall further, potentially below its outlet at the north end of the
lake (Fig. 1). If this happens, Kluane Lake will become a closed
basin. Second, the large supply of sediment to Kluane Lake from
Slims River2224 has ended, with unknown eects on the structure
and chemistry of the lake and its ecosystems25. For example, in
summer 2016,massive afternoon dust storms occurred almost daily
on the nearly abandoned Slims River floodplain (Supplementary
Fig. 3) due to the lower lake level, possibly altering nutrient fluxes
to the lake. Third, Slims, Kaskawulsh and Alsek rivers must now
all adjust to altered discharges. For example, as flow and sediment
transport in Slims River have decreased greatly, channel stability
there may increase, resulting in conversion from a braided to a
wandering or meandering river planform26. Increased flows in
Kaskawulsh River may increase sediment conveyance and bank
erosion. Fourth, large-scale changes to drainage basin geometry
and re-routing of meltwater may introduce considerable changes
to fish populations and habitat, including eects produced by
the timing of flows27. Fifth, assuming that Kaskawulsh Glacier
continues to thin and recede, Kaskawulsh River may advance its
drainage headward (northward) into the easily erodible Slims River
valley fill and towards Kluane Lake, thereby capturing the discharge
of the small mountain streams that previously joined Slims River. It
is noteworthy that the present head of Kaskawulsh River is 25m
below the current level of Kluane Lake and, as a consequence,
there is gravitational potential to drive continued expansion of
the Kaskawulsh River catchment towards the lake (Fig. 5). Thus,
over time, headward erosion could result in Kaskawulsh River
reaching the south end of Kluane Lake and re-establishing its
former southerly drainage to the Pacific Ocean15,19.
These eects highlight the consequences of climate-induced
glacier retreat, and river piracy triggered by such retreat, on the
routing of water and sediment across a deglaciating landscape. Such
changes undoubtedly were common, and probably occurred on a
larger scale, during the decay of ice sheets in North America and
Eurasia at the close of the Pleistocene, as shown by abandoned
and buried valleys that are common features of formerly glaciated
landscapes.We contend that radical reorganizations of drainage can
occur in a geologic instant, although they may also be driven by
longer-term climate change. The potential consequences of such
channel re-routing and environmental change are amplified by
anthropogenic activity and settlement, and these eects can be
expected to have significant eects on both ecosystem functioning
and economic infrastructure, for example hydroelectric power
generation and water supply, as glacier retreat proceeds in a
future warming climate. Most studies of the eects of climate
change on glacial environments deal with enhanced melt or contri-
butions to sea-level rise. We suggest that the eects can be more
far reaching.Structural Control, Evolution, and Accumulation Rates of Massive Sulfides in the TAG Hydrothermal Field

Abstract 
The Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is one of the best-studied hydrothermal systems to date. However, high-resolution bathymetric data obtained in 2016 by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) reveal new information about the distribution of active and inactive hydrothermal deposits, and their relation to structural features. The discovery of previously undocumented inactive vent sites contributes to a better understanding of the accumulation rates and the resource potential of seafloor massive sulfide deposits at slow-spreading ridges. The interpretation of ship-based and high-resolution AUVbased data sets allowed for the determination of the main tectonic stress regimes that have a first-order control on the location and distribution of past and present hydrothermal activity. The data reveal the importance of cross-cutting lineament populations and temporal variations in the prevalent stress regime. 
A dozen sulfide mounds contribute to a substantial accumulation of hydrothermal material (ca. 29 Mt). The accumulation rate of ca. 1500 t/y is comparable to those of other modern seafloor vent fields. However, our observations suggest that the TAG segment is different from many other slow-spreading ridge segments in its tectonic complexity, which confines sulfide formation into a relatively small area and is responsible for the longevity of the hydrothermal system and substantial mineral accumulation. The inactive and weaklyactive mounds contain almost ten times the amount of material as the active high-temperature mound, providing an important indication of the global resource potential for inactive seafloor massive sulfide deposits. 
 
Plain language summary 
Previously unknown hydrothermal mounds were discovered by an autonomous underwater vehicle in the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal field in the central Atlantic Ocean. The location of the hydrothermal mounds is controlled by crossing fault and fissure populations that have been active at different times. The material in the newly discovered mounds together with that of the previously known mounds accumulates to ca. 29 Mt of hydrothermal material. Most of the tonnage is contained in inactive or only weakly-active mounds where hydrothermal activity has already ceased or is in a waning stage. The hydrothermal activity likely occurs periodically and we assume an accumulation rate of ca. 1500 t/y, which is comparable to rates from other hydrothermal fields. Within the TAG hydrothermal field, however, the sulfides seem to accumulate over long periods of time and in a relatively small area which is a result of the complex tectonic history of the area. 
 
1.Introduction 
Since the discovery of inactive and active massive sulfide chimneys along the East Pacific Rise (Francheteau et al., 1979; Hekinian et al., 1980), these systems and their associated biological communities have been in the focus of international research. Today we know of more than 600 active and inactive sites of hydrothermal venting, either inferred from the detection of hydrothermal plumes (active only) or confirmed from visual ground-truthing (active and inactive) (Beaulieu et al., 2013), with more than 900 additional undiscovered sites estimated to occur along the young mid-ocean spreading ridges (Beaulieu et al., 2015). Seafloor hydrothermal systems play a major role in the input of metals to the ocean, affecting not only chemical but also biological processes (German et al., 2016). Furthermore, seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits, which form at sites of high-temperature hydrothermal venting, are, together with manganese nodules and cobalt crusts, considered as a possible contribution to the future global metal supply (Rona, 2003; Cathles, 2011; Hannington et al., 2011; Petersen et al., 2016). 
Our current understanding of the resource potential of SMS deposits is, however, severely limited by our lack of knowledge about the distribution and size of these deposits. Most of the known marine sulfide occurrences are small (<< 1 Mt each; Hannington et al., 2010; Beaulieu et al., 2013), and clusters of larger deposits, a common observation in land-based sulfide districts (Sangster, 1980), have rarely been documented along mid-ocean ridges (Rona et al., 1993a, 1993b; Cherkashev et al., 2013; M¨¹ller et al., 2018).  
Global resource estimates for SMS deposits are lacking several of the fundamental answers that need to be addressed. There are currently several orders of magnitude between estimates based on observations at the seafloor and those based on calculated metal fluxes (Cathles, 2011; Hannington et al., 2011). In order to produce realistic resource estimates, we must understand how much metal is released by high-temperature fluid convection over a given length of a ridge segment, the specific geological time frame in which it is deposited as massive sulfide, and how much is preserved after hydrothermal activity ceases. Inactive deposits are assumed to be more common and larger than active deposits as they have gone through a full cycle of hydrothermal activity (Jamieson et al., 2014, Van Dover et al., 2018). However, as a consequence of current exploration technologies (i.e. primarily searching for active deposits through investigations of geochemical and geophysical anomalies in the overlying water column), there have been only a few systematic regional surveys for massive sulfide accumulations that target both active and inactive deposits. These recent surveys mainly investigated areas close to the spreading axis using AUVs (Jamieson et al., 2014; Clague et al., 2018; Paduan et al., 2018). Large-scale (tens of square kilometers), high-resolution surveys at a tectonically complex slow-spreading ridge had never been performed. Within the framework of the Blue Mining project, an EU-funded, interdisciplinary project for the development of scientific, technical and legal solutions concerning deep-sea mining, regional survey methods were developed and tested, providing us with the tools to assess the amount and the accumulation rate of sulfides along a significant portion of a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge segment. In this paper we use ship-based and AUV-based bathymetric data from the TAG hydrothermal field on the central Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and its geological interpretation to document the distribution of active and inactive hydrothermal mounds in order to investigate the geological processes that govern their location, and, using deposit age data from previous work, to determine deposit growth rates. 
1.1.Geological setting 
The TAG hydrothermal field is located at 26¡ã08¡¯N, on a 40 km-long segment of the MAR between the Atlantis Fracture Zone (30¡ãN) and the Kane Fracture Zone (24¡ãN) (Fig.1). Since 2014 this area has been part of the French exploration license area granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). The TAG segment is bounded by two right-stepping non-transform discontinuities (NTDs), which offset the ridge axis by about 4-5 km to the east (Purdy et al., 1990; Semp¨¦r¨¦ et al., 1993). While the segment ends are marked by deep nodal basins, the axial valley floor rises from 4500 m to about 3600 m towards the segment center, which is also marked by a decrease in the width of the axial valley from 9 to 6 km (Semp¨¦r¨¦ et al., 1993).  
The TAG segment shows a strong morphological asymmetry between the western and eastern ridge flanks (Zonenshain et al., 1989). The western flank is characterized by axis-parallel ridges and terraces, which are bounded by major normal faults, extending for more than 10 km along- axis and accommodate throws of more than 100 m (Zonenshain et al., 1989; Kleinrock and Humphris, 1996a). The eastern flank shows a steeper but smoother morphology and rises to water depths of less than 1,400 m (Karson and Rona, 1990). Widespread parts of the lower eastern flank are covered by mass-wasting deposits (White et al., 1998), with only a small number of exposed scarps in the upper section that define major fault blocks (Zonenshain et al., 1989; Karson and Rona, 1990). No ultramafic material has been found to date, however, Zonenshain et al. (1989) reported the exposure of gabbros and dikes at the eastern flank at water depths of 3000 m, indicating that vertical movement along the bounding faults was sufficient to expose lower crustal rocks. 
The valley floor hosts abundant volcanic centers (Zonenshain et al., 1989; Rona et al., 1993a). The western half is dominated by hummocky volcanic ridges that are partially covered by sheet flows (Kleinrock et al., 1996; Kleinrock and Humphris, 1996b). In contrast, the eastern section of the valley floor, which hosts parts of the hydrothermal field, is a highly tectonized volcanic terrain (Kleinrock and Humphris, 1996b) characterized by dense normal faulting and fissuring (Karson and Rona, 1990; Bohnenstiehl and Kleinrock, 1999). 
1.2.	The TAG hydrothermal field 
The TAG hydrothermal field is considered to be basalt-hosted (Rona et al., 1993b). However, based on a near-bottom magnetic survey and the occurrence of gabbros on the eastern slope (Zonenshain et al., 1989), Tivey et al. (2003) suggested that the TAG hydrothermal field lies on the hanging wall of an oceanic detachment fault. Subsequently, several seismic studies (Canales et al., 2007; DeMartin et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2008; Schouten et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2012) confirmed this and reported the presence of a dome-like fault surface that dips at a steep angle but flattens to about 20¡ã at depths shallower than 3 km below the seafloor under the eastern side of the axial valley. While earlier studies (Tivey et al., 2003; Canales et al., 2007; DeMartin et al., 2007) proposed a young oceanic detachment system, Smith et al., (2008) and Zhao et al. (2012) suggested the presence of an older fault system, extending over 15 km to the east. Therefore, detachment faulting may have shaped the eastern ridge flank for more than 1.35 million years (Zhao et al., 2012). 
Early studies of the TAG field described hydrothermal Mn-crusts in a low-temperature zone on the upper eastern flank (Rona, 1976; Rona et al., 1984). Subsequent video-sled surveys documented the active TAG mound on the valley floor (Fig. 2), venting hydrothermal fluids with exit temperatures greater than 360¡ãC (Rona et al., 1986). During follow-up side scan sonar, manned submersible and video-sled surveys, several inactive, as well as weakly-active mounds, were discovered north-east and east of the active TAG mound (Lisitsyn et al., 1989; Rona et al., 1993a, 1993b; Kleinrock et al., 1996b). The Mir Mound, the largest mound structure in the more extensive ¡°Mir Zone¡± (Rona et al., 1993a), shows weak signs of hydrothermal activity and is located 2 km ENE of the TAG mound, on an uplifted crustal block (Rona et al., 1993b). In the north, several inactive mounds cluster together with another weakly-active mound in the so-called ¡°Three Mound area¡± (southern part of the former ¡°Alvin Zone¡±). Here, the three large mounds, Southern Mound, which shows evidence for lowtemperature fluid flow and associated bacterial mats (Murton et al., 2019), Double Mound (former Alvin Mound) and Shinkai (former New Mound), together with the smaller New Mound 2 and New Mound 3, form a closely spaced group of sulfide occurrences, representing a large accumulation of sulfide material (Fig. 2). In 1998 after more than two decades of research in the TAG area, another weakly-active low-temperature vent site with sulfide mineralization, called Shimmering Mound, was found 1.5 km north of the Three Mound area (Fig. 2a) by side scan sonar and video-sled surveys (White et al., 1998).  
Previous studies documented a local tectonic control on the location of the active TAG mound and its association with an intersection of different fault zones, extending from the eastern flank into the valley floor (Karson and Rona, 1990; Kleinrock and Humphris, 1996a). Following the discovery of the detachment fault, Canales et al. 2007 concluded that the hydrothermal field is located in a high-porosity zone in the hanging wall of the detachment fault, where episodic movement along the fault surfaces may have resulted in increased permeability of the hanging wall, periodically reactivating the hydrothermal system and contributing to its longevity (Tivey et al., 2003). 
Dating of hydrothermal samples suggests that the hydrothermal activity in the TAG area started about 140 ka ago in the Mir Zone and at 125 ka in the low-temperature zone and later formed sulfide mounds (Three Mound area, TAG active mound, and Shimmering Mound) by episodic hydrothermal activity (Lalou et al., 1986, 1993, 1995). The current phase of high-temperature venting is confined to the active mound and is thought to have initiated nearly 80 years ago (Lalou et al., 1995, 1998).  
The heat source driving hydrothermal circulation in the TAG hydrothermal field for the past 140 ka as well as the geometry of the circulation cell are still poorly constrained (Humphris et al., 2015). Both a magmatic body close to 26¡ã06¡¯N (Kong et al., 1992) and heat delivered from the root zone of the detachment several kilometers below the seafloor have been suggested as the possible heat source for the TAG active mound (Canales et al., 2007; DeMartin et al., 2007). Recent studies, however, indicate that the source may be located below the fault (Zhao et al., 2012; McCaig et al., 2013), suggesting that an intrusion into the footwall of the detachment is the most likely heat source for the TAG hydrothermal field (McCaig et al., 2007, 2013; Zhao et al., 2012).  

2.Data and Methods 
During research cruise M127 on board of RV Meteor in 2016, extensive bathymetric data sets were collected using Meteor¡¯s hull-mounted Kongsberg EM122 system, operating at a frequency of 12 kHz, in order to map the entire length of the 26¡ãN segment including the nontransform offsets to the north and south and the off-axis areas (up to 25 km) on each side. The majority of surveys (710 nm in total) were conducted with a symmetrical beam spacing of 45¡ã to both sides (90¡ã full swath angle), a survey speed of 6-8 kn and a line spacing of 3 km, giving a typical swath width on the seafloor of around 7 km and yielding bathymetric grids with a final grid resolution of 30 m. In total, an area of about 4000 km2 was mapped by the shipmounted multibeam system within the study area. 
Additional high-resolution bathymetric data were gathered with the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Abyss 6000 (owned and operated by GEOMAR), which is equipped with a Reson Seabat 7125 multibeam echosounder. Bathymetric data from 11 AUV dives, using the 200 kHz multibeam configuration, were combined using MB System (Caress, 1999) to create a continuous map over a 7 by 7 km area, with a grid resolution of 2 m, positionally fixed with relation to the location of the well-located drilling re-entry cone on the active TAG mound, left behind after the Ocean Drilling Program Leg 158 drilling project (Humphris et al., 1996). More than 47 km2 of the axial valley and the adjacent lower eastern valley wall were mapped in highresolution by the AUV. In addition, the Mir Zone and Three Mound area were also mapped at a grid resolution of 50 cm during two missions, using the 400 kHz configuration, at three different altitudes (20, 50, and 80 m). Processing of the raw data was carried out using MB Systems (Caress, 1999), false soundings were removed with QPS Qimera and a digital bathymetric model (DBM) was created with QPS Fledermaus.  
A series of criteria derived from the bathymetric data sets were used to define hydrothermal targets and to distinguish them from volcanic mounds. First, slope, surface roughness, and shape in the high-resolution topography data were visually examined in order to identify hydrothermal targets on the seafloor (after Jamieson et al., 2014). Additionally, magnetic lows in the AUV-based magnetic data (Tivey et al., 1993), as well as low backscatter anomalies observed in the ship-based multibeam data, were also considered for the identification of potential targets. Subsequently, the most promising targets were visually inspected using HYBIS, a remotely-controlled multi-purpose vehicle (owned and operated by GEOMAR).  
2.1. Geological and structural mapping  
Extensive mapping has been carried out in the area of the TAG segment and the vicinity of the TAG hydrothermal field (Fig. 3, 8, and 10). Mapped units and features are primarily defined by their characteristics in the bathymetric and backscatter data. To guide the classification of the terrain, derivatives from the DBMs such as slope (angle of inclination), aspect (slope direction), curvature (slope changes) and roughness (topographic variation) and were calculated using the open-source software QGIS (v. 3.8.0 Zanzibar; QGIS Development Team, 2019). Structural lineaments were manually mapped as polylines based on the morphological expression in the DBM (an overview is given in Table 1), using the calculated aspect and curvature grids as an aid. Rose diagrams were generated with the QGIS plugin ¡°Line orientation histogram¡±-plugin (v. 2.6).  
2.2. Volume estimations 
Volume calculations for the hydrothermal mounds were conducted in QGIS, by manually defining the outlines of the mound in the high-resolution DBM and subsequently calculating the volume between the actual surface of the mound in the high-resolution data and a reference base. This reference surface is created by inverse-distance weighted (IDW) interpolation based on the terrain along the defined outline and models the original seafloor before the formation of the hydrothermal mounds. We assume that this method is more accurate than using a flat surface at a single depth or evenly tilted plane as a lower boundary of the mounds (an exemplary figure (Fig. S1) for the comparison of the bathymetry and the reference surface of the Mir Mound is included in the supporting information). However, our method does not account for the possibilities that the mounds have formed on top of a smaller volcanic edifice, in a depression or fissure. Due to the irregular shape of the mounds and the rough topography, defining the outlines and extent of the mounds is difficult and the volume and tonnage calculations should be considered as estimates only. A more detailed and precise estimate is, however, only possible by determining the thickness and composition of the interior of the deposits through extensive drilling. 

3.Results 
3.1. Regional geological setting of the TAG segment 
The structural asymmetry between the western and the eastern ridge flanks of the TAG segment is prominent in the ship-based bathymetry. The western flank is characterized by narrow, axisparallel ridges that extend along-axis for up to 37 km (Fig. 1). These ridges are marked by eastsoutheast dipping normal faults with pronounced fault scarps, which reflect the general trend of the ridge axis (~027¡ãN) (see Fig. 3a). In contrast, the topography on the eastern flank is dominated by three axis-parallel ridges that extend over 30 km along axis. The easternmost and largest ridge rises to a water depth of less than 1,400 m. Each of these ridges exhibits prominent northwest facing escarpments. The easternmost ridge shows a smooth northwest-dipping slope, which contains a few structures that are parallel to the spreading direction (Fig. 1). The origin of these structures is not known. Compared to the fault pattern on the western ridge flank, faulting on the eastern flank is more complex. 
The large fault systems bounding the three ridges are adjoined by an area to the east that is dominated by smaller faults with varying dipping directions. Transverse, E-W trending faults are observed north of the hydrothermal field on the eastern side of the axis, extending from the flank onto the valley floor, creating a step-like morphology towards the northern NTD (Fig. 3b).  
The valley floor shows abundant evidence of volcanism in the form of pillow mounds and hummocky ridges, smoother volcanic plains, and small axial volcanoes. A continuous neovolcanic zone cannot be identified along the TAG segment, however, north of the 26¡ã17N NTD a large axial volcanic ridge (AVR) is apparent that extends for more than 18 km to the north and beyond the area investigated here (Fig. 3a). Based on the rough and mostly unfaulted appearance, the hummocky ridges in the center of the axial valley appear to be the areas of most recent volcanic activity and form small neovolcanic ridges, two of which are located 3-4 km west of the active TAG mound (Fig. 3b). Small volcanoes are scattered throughout the valley floor but also on both ridge flanks. Flat-top volcanoes occur in a range of sizes from only a few hundred meters to over 2 km in diameter. 
The hydrothermal vent field, however, is located at the raised eastern half of the valley floor close to the intersection with the eastern bounding wall fault. 
3.2. Geological and structural setting of the TAG vent field  
The area of the TAG hydrothermal field, located on the eastern part of the axial valley, was mapped in high-resolution by the AUV (Fig. 2a). The western half of this area is dominated by pillow mounds. This volcanic terrain stretches from the center of the valley in the west to about 1 km east of the active TAG mound and extends along the entire length of the area mapped by AUV. The southwestern part of the working area, as well as sections west and northwest of the Shinkai mound show intact pillow mounds and smaller hummocky ridges that are not dissected by faulting (see Fig. 2a).  
In contrast, the central part of the area shows strong axis-parallel lineations caused by extensional faulting, which is restricted to a 1-1.5 km wide band north of the active TAG mound and a smaller section 500 m to the south (Fig. 2a). The regions immediately west and south of the active mound as well as the north-western corner of the mapped area show signs of a second, cross-cutting fault system that is oblique to perpendicular to the spreading axis, trending northeast-southwest (Fig. 4). Therefore, we interpret the active TAG mound to be located at the boundary between an extensional zone in the north and an oblique-fissured zone to the south and west. A small hydrothermal mound (#11) was discovered 750 m west of the active mound, which grew superimposed on a larger volcanic mound (Fig. 2a). This mound is covered in hydrothermal material based on a visual inspection and by gravity coring, recovering Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxides (Petersen and Shipboard Scientific Party, 2016). The area east of the active mound is marked by a relict ponded flow which has a smooth surface and exhibits several collapse structures (Fig. 4). It lacks any faulting or fracturing, so appears relatively young, however, a sediment cover of several decimeters has been documented by visual inspection, indicating that this ponded lava flow was not formed by a recent volcanic event (Murton et al., 2018). The ponded flow and the area immediately to the north of it, which is formed by unfaulted and unfissured pillow mounds (Fig. 4), create an ¡°untectonized island¡± separating the extensional fault zone in the west from the Mir block in the east.  
The south-eastern section of the mapped area is characterized by a major slope, extending from water depths of 3,700 m to 2,800 m (see Fig. 2b). Zonenshain et al. (1989) observed lower crustal rocks in this area, however, different lithologies could not be distinguished in our highresolution bathymetric data. This major slope is marked by a fault scarp upslope, which forms the boundary to a plateau-like area. This plateau features highly sedimented volcanic hummocks, which are faulted in a northeast-southwest trend and represents the oldest volcanic terrain in the entire area.  
The northern section of the survey area is characterized by three distinct areas (Fig. 5). A strongly tectonized ¡°chaotic¡± zone with abundant faults and ridges that show highly variable strike directions, dominates the central region. This area separates the sulfide mound-hosting trough with the Three Mound area in the south from the ¡°smooth northern block¡±. This northern block exhibits a smooth seafloor topography and stretches for 1.8 km from a major westwarddipping fault to a corrugated surface in the east. The west-facing fault and the associated topographic high hosts the weakly-active Shimmering Mound, the northernmost sulfide occurrence in this area. The eastern limit of the smooth northern block is dominated by a sharp ridge, which is inferred to be the termination of a detachment fault (Fig. 5). The corrugated surface of this detachment extends for more than 600 m further eastward and extends over a distance of 1.8 km in the along-axis direction, possibly extending even further north, beyond the area mapped by the AUV. The corrugated surface is bounded by a fault scarp in the east, likely the breakaway of this detachment fault (Fig. 5).  
3.3. Structural setting of the Three Mound area 
Mapping of the Three Mound area in 50 cm grid resolution (Fig. 6) reveals distinct differences in the topography, age, and geological history of sulfide mounds located in this area. Southern Mound, as well as Shinkai Mound and the small sulfide mounds New Mound 2 and New Mound 3, are hosted within an elongated trough that runs in a NW-SE direction. This trough is heavily dissected and appears to be older than the axis-parallel faulting. 
The mounds in the west (Shinkai, New Mound 2, and New Mound 3) appear to be unaffected by the axis-parallel faulting and show relatively smooth, steep slopes (median slopes of 29¡ã for Shinkai Mound; 33¡ã for New Mound 3, and 28¡ã for New Mound 2; Table 2). In contrast, the large Double Mound, located in the chaotic zone (Fig. 5) and Southern Mound, which are both located 500 m further to the east, are intensely cut by faults, are sediment-covered (Murton et al., 2019), and their slopes are more gentle (26¡ã and 22¡ã respectively). Rona Mound, an inactive sulfide mound identified during our cruise M127, is located a further 200 m east of Southern Mound. This mound also shows gentle slopes (median slope of 22¡ã) and is bounded by two opposing faults. The smooth topography and the gentle slope of the mound also contrast with the inactive mounds in the west (e.g., Shinkai) and are more akin to the closer Southern and Double mounds. We, therefore, assume that the low relief mounds in the east are older than the steep-sided mounds to the west. The strike of the faults in the Three Mound area varies from N to ENE, deviating slightly from the general trend of the spreading axis. However, the trends are within the range of regional fault orientations. The dipping directions of the faults reflect a horst and graben system rather than axis-facing normal faults (Fig. 6b). The smaller Mont de Reliques and mound #24, which was discovered during M127, are both hosted in the chaotic zone but appear to be unaffected by faulting and might have formed after the dissection of the older Double, Rona, and Southern mounds. 
3.4. Structural setting of the Mir Zone 
The Mir Mound is located 2 km ENE of the active TAG mound and was also mapped at 50 cm grid resolution (Fig. 7). The mound is located just east of the escarpment of a west-facing fault that stretches for over one kilometer in a N-S direction (Fig. 7b), extending into the trough that runs through the Three Mound area. The extent of the Mir Mound appears to be smaller than previously reported based on the observation of metalliferous sediments during submersible dives (Rona et al., 1993b). The mound has an elongated sickle shape and stretches ~400 m in a northwest-southeast direction. The center is marked by a depression, which is connected to the west by an erosional gully (Fig. 7c). Standing and toppled chimneys are visible in the bathymetric data in the northern, eastern, and southern parts of the mound. The upper part of the west-dipping fault is covered by sulfide talus and chimney fragments resulting in a rough surface texture. The area to the west of the fault is characterized by unfaulted hummocky, volcanic terrain. The areas east and northeast of the Mir Mound are characterized by oblique NNE to NE trending faults and ridges. The origin of a few smaller features and mounds to the SE of the Mir Mound (Fig. 7c) cannot be determined by bathymetric observations alone, although their irregular morphology suggests a hydrothermal origin. Two larger targets (Abyss Mound and target #29), which are located along the west-facing fault scarp north of the Mir Mound (Fig. 7a), were also confirmed to be of hydrothermal origin during a visual survey with the towed HYBIS-system.  
3.5. Volume and tonnage considerations for the hydrothermal mounds 
The high-resolution bathymetric data sets offer the opportunity to calculate volumes of the hydrothermal mounds in order to quantify the amount of hydrothermal material amassed along a section of the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Table 2) and enables us to estimate the accumulation rate over time. To convert volume to tonnage, we have to assume a density for the material. Published density values for individual SMS samples vary between 1.6 and 4.6 t/m3. For more porous surface sulfides average dry bulk values between 3.1 t/m3 (Tivey et al., 1999; Jamieson et al., 2014) and 3.6 t/m3 (Spagnoli et al., 2016) have been used. The most comprehensive set of dry bulk density measurements was performed by Nautilus Minerals for their resource estimate for the Solwara-1 deposit. The dry bulk density of over 400 samples of sulfide-dominant rock from drill core averages 3.3 t/m3 (range from 2.2 to 4.4 t/m3; Golder Associates Pty. Ltd., 2012). Hannington et al. (1998) used an average density of 3.8 t/m3 in their assessment of the active TAG mound based on values for dominantly massive, recrystallized pyrite samples drilled from the subseafloor at TAG (Ludwig et al., 1998). As pyrite is likely the dominant sulfide within all inactive mounds in the TAG field (Lehrmann et al., 2018; Murton et al., 2019) we use an intermediate value of 3.5 t/m3 for our tonnage estimates.  
The largest tonnage calculated for the mounds above the reference surface is contained in the Mir Mound (5.5 Mt), followed by Southern Mound (4.3 Mt) and Shinkai Mound (3.3 Mt). For the active TAG mound, although one of the largest known seafloor massive sulfide occurrences, our estimate indicates a tonnage of only 2.3 Mt above the reference surface. Substantial (> 1 Mt) sulfide tonnage is also present at Double Mound, Shimmering Mound, and Abyss Mound. The other hydrothermal occurrences do not add significantly to the total tonnage estimate of the study area. Unlike for the newly identified larger sulfide mounds that have been sampled (e.g., Rona Mound and Abyss Mound), it is unclear if the hydrothermal areas from targets #24, #29 and near #11 (Fig. 2, 5 and 7) are underlain by sulfide material at all. The cumulative tonnage for the entire field is estimated to be 22.1 Mt of sulfide material deposited above our baseline reference surfaces with the largest portion (~90 %) contained in the inactive and weakly-active mounds. 
As no true thickness information is available for the inactive and weakly-active mounds, this tonnage estimate has a high degree of associated uncertainty. Our volume calculations assume that the mounds are entirely made up of sulfides. However, it is also possible that these mounds could be composed of sulfide material covering preexisting basaltic pillow mounds. However, the slopes of the mounds, the exposure of massive sulfides along the bounding faults (Murton et al., 2019), and results from drilling into the active TAG mound (Humphris et al., 1996) and the upper few meters of Southern, Rona and Mir mounds (Lehrmann et al., 2018; Murton et al., 2019) all indicate a hydrothermal origin of at least these mounds. Sulfide accumulation also occurs below the seafloor, mainly within the alteration pipes of the hydrothermal upflow zone where alteration, brecciation, and dissolution enhance permeability and allow for subseafloor precipitation of sulfide minerals, including sulfide veins and replacement of the host rock (Petersen et al., 2000). Based on drilling observations from the active TAG mound where the subseafloor stockwork zone accounts for 30 % of the total sulfide tonnage (Hannington et al., 1998) we assume similar proportions for mound/subseafloor tonnage for each of the inactive mounds and add 30% subseafloor sulfides to the tonnage. This will raise the tonnage of the entire TAG vent field to just below 29 Mt.  

4.Discussion 
4.1. Regional geological control 
Similar to many other segments on the MAR, the TAG segment is characterized by the interplay of tectonic and magmatic processes (Tucholke and Lin, 1994). However, compared to magmatically robust segments, magmatic accretion at the TAG segment is not focused at the segment center and appears to be more diffuse and distributed along the axis (Zhao et al., 2012). Furthermore, as previous authors have noted, there is a striking asymmetry in this segment of the MAR. The western side is dominated by axis-parallel ridges, terraces, and prominent fault scarps, reflecting the common morphology of slow-spreading ridge crust (Semp¨¦r¨¦ et al., 1993; Tucholke and Lin, 1994).  
Smith et al. (2008) reported bathymetric corrugations from the areas in between the eastern ridges. We could not confirm the proposed corrugations in the off-axis region based on our ship-based bathymetric data with a grid resolution of 30 m, aside from the spreading parallel structures on the steep flank of the easternmost ridge (Fig. 1). Some of these structures show similarities to corrugations, however, the slope is steeper (>23¡ã) compared to the typical lowangle dip of other corrugated surfaces in the Atlantic (Escart¨ªn et al., 2017; Olive et al., 2019). Furthermore, it should be noted, that the resolution of the older bathymetry, on which the presence of corrugations is based, is coarser than the data presented here. Despite the geophysical evidence, the lack of prominent corrugations contrasts with observations at other detachment systems and OCCs in the Atlantic (Blackman et al., 1998; Ranero and Reston, 1999; Escart¨ªn et al., 2003; MacLeod et al., 2009) where extensive corrugated surfaces can be overserved in the ship-based data sets.  
An explanation for the absence of major corrugations in our ship-based bathymetric data might be that the eastern ridges are ¡°rider blocks¡±, rafted blocks of the basaltic hanging wall, superimposed on a large detachment structure, covering the fault plane (Smith et al., 2008; Schouten et al., 2010). This type of detachment system is reportedly more common at segment centers and more frequent along the MAR than previously thought (Reston and Ranero, 2011; Cann et al., 2015). However, the branches of the detachment fault that are bounding the rafted blocks have not been imaged by seismic surveys yet. Furthermore, the exact location of the original breakaway is also not known. A large flat-top volcano, located 23 km east-south-east of the active TAG mound, at the eastern flank of the massif (Fig. 3), appears to be tilted by more than 15-20¡ã to the east, indicating that the breakaway might be in the eastern section of the massif. An accurate interpretation and classification of the off-axis terrain and the determination of the localization of the original breakaway region are hindered by regional sedimentation at this distance to the spreading axis. Assuming an average sedimentation rate of 1.8 cm/ka (Scott et al., 1978) and the estimated half-spreading rate of between 12 and 13 mm/y in the east (McGregor et al., 1977; Tivey et al., 2003), the sediment thickness in this area could be more than 30 m, thereby obscuring smaller features and minor fault scarps in the data.  
4.2. Local geological controls and implications on the location of the hydrothermal mounds 
The high-resolution bathymetry shows a large morphological variability within the hydrothermal field, indicating a strong interplay of tectonic and volcanic processes in the area. The volcanic valley floor is affected to various degrees by faulting and fissuring and can be divided into different structural domains (Fig. 8). The center of the hydrothermal field is heavily tectonized and dominated by extensional faulting. We mapped more than 1200 lineaments in the AUV bathymetry (2 m grid resolution), and the analysis of the strike direction distribution shows three distinct orientation groups (Fig. 9) of which the axis-parallel group and the obliquely trending group are confined to certain areas within the hydrothermal field, implying different causes for their formation. The same trends can also be observed in the 50 cm bathymetry of the Three Mound area and Mir Zone (Fig. 10). The mapped lineaments in both areas show a strong correlation with the orientation of the spreading axis. However, while the Mir Zone shows only minor secondary peaks in the orientation of the lineaments, the Three Mound area exhibits a strong secondary peak at 10¡ãN, potentially representing an older, deviating fault system associated with the formation of the trough, that runs through the Three 
Mound area. The intersection of this feature with the different fault populations seems to be one of the main controlling factors for the location of the hydrothermal mounds in the Mir Zone as well as the Three Mound area. Assuming that this trough is an older transfer fault connecting the large bounding fault in the west of the Mir Zone with the northern area, Shimmering Mound might be located on the same larger fault system, that is however partially overprinted by the chaotic zone. 
The overall lineament orientations are in good agreement with the trends originally reported by Bohnenstiehl and Kleinrock (1999) from the ¡°fault and fissure zone (FFZ)¡± in the center of the hydrothermal field and by Bohnenstiehl and Kleinrock (2000) from the vicinity of the active TAG mound. Bohnenstiehl and Kleinrock (1999) indicate that the majority of the extensional faults in the area (>65%; n=200) dip eastwards. Our observation deviates slightly from this finding and reflects a horst and graben type of faulting within the extensional zone in the central part of the hydrothermal field.  
The active TAG mound and mound #11 occur at the boundary of the extensional zone in the north and the oblique-fissured area in the south (Fig. 8). While mound #11 is bounded by relatively unfissured, intact volcanic terrain to the south, the active mound is located on the north-western side of a larger pillow mound terrain, which is cut by several axis-parallel, westfacing faults and some smaller oblique ones (Fig. 4). Two major, axis-parallel faults occur within 400 m east of the active mound and extend towards the trough in the north, where they bend east just 200 m south of Southern Mound. These faults were already reported by White et al. (1998) and are, based on the cross-cutting relationships, either younger faults or reflect the rejuvenation of older extensional faults in the center of the hydrothermal field. Our observations show that some of the axis-parallel faults are cut by the oblique faults, indicating that the development of the oblique faults followed extension (Fig. 4). However, the two large, axis-parallel faults near TAG offset the oblique faults. This implies that multiple phases of extensional faulting and oblique fracture development occurred within the hydrothermal field.  
Nonetheless, our interpretation of alternating phases of faulting and fissuring deviates from Kleinrock and Humphris (1996a), who proposed that the oblique fissures were pre-existing before the initiation of extensional faulting. These oblique fissures are most likely not associated with extensional faulting as they deviate from the general trend of the spreading axis by more than 40¡ã. However, this deviation of the stress regime is interpreted to be localized because the oblique trend is not present within the entire southern part of the area mapped by the AUV. As previously mentioned, ¡°islands¡± of unfaulted pillow mound terrain, as well as a smaller section of axis-parallel faulted volcanic terrain, are present in the south. The cause of the oblique trend seems to be confined to smaller sections and corridors in the south and north of the area. Bohnenstiehl and Kleinrock (2000) suggested shallow, laterally propagating dikes and the resulting temporal rotation of the stress field as a source for the oblique lineament population, which is known from other spreading zones (Gudmundsson, 1990, 1998) and mainly occurs during episodes of high magmatic activity and dike emplacement. The dominance of the far-field tectonic stress, associated with the plate movement might prevail after a period during which the strain of the dike emplacement dissipates. Such dikes may originate at the spreading axis south of the area mapped here by the AUV, where neovolcanic ridges can be observed in the ship-based multibeam data (Fig. 3). Such volcanic centers and hummocky ridges are commonly fed by fissure eruptions related to major diking events. Bohnenstiehl and Kleinrock (2000) suggest that secondary dikes originated from on-axis fissure eruptions might be sufficient enough to induce axis-oblique fissuring, but they also reported that only 1% of the observed fissures in the vicinity of the active mound show any association with volcanic extrusives.  
Another explanation for the oblique trend might be the accommodation zone proposed by Karson and Rona (1990). Even though there is no clear structure extending from the flank onto the hanging wall, structural features (fault scarps and smaller faults) show contrasting orientations between the northern section and the major slope south of the Mir block. Furthermore, a few fault lines on the lower flank show similar oblique trends to the valley floor, which might indicate that the deviating stress-field was also present during the time of the formation of the eastern flank and that there is a larger regional-scale influence not related to the intrusion and propagation of dikes.  
4.3. Implications for hydrothermal convection 
Humphris et al. (2015) emphasize that the geometry of the convection cell under the hydrothermal system is still not well understood. The location of the weakly-active and inactive sulfide mounds along the N-S trending fault at Shimmering Mound, the slightly curved NWSE trending trough in the Three Mound area, that extends into the N-S trending fault in the west of the Mir Zone, along with the absence of a magma chamber in the vicinity of the hydrothermal field (Canales et al., 2007), seems to favor an interpretation where hydrothermal fluids are fed by convection driven by a regional heat source at depth and where multiple upflow zones develop in response to the opening of local pathways. This is in agreement with the age dating by Lalou et al. (1995) that indicates simultaneous high-temperature activity not only at the active TAG mound but also at Double Mound. This model explains the widespread distribution of sulfide mounds of various ages, the presence of current low-temperature activity at several mounds, and the focus of high-temperature venting solely at the active mound to date. 
The different stages of erosion and tectonic faulting of the sulfide mounds indicate that the location of the upflow zones is changing over time, likely in response to movement along the dominant faults in the specific areas. The diversion of hydrothermal fluids may be further facilitated by the intersection of the faults with past or present-day low-angle detachment faults at depth, which might increase the permeability of the hanging wall (McCaig et al., 2013). 
The prominent corrugated surface that is visible in the northeast part of the AUV-based highresolution map marks the presence of a detachment fault, indicating that a significant portion of the spreading in this area is accommodated by tectonic movement. This corrugated surface can be traced in seismic data for several kilometers, dipping at a shallow angle, towards the spreading axis in the west, where it seems to be bounded by another detachment fault (Szitkar et al., 2019). The relation between the corrugated detachment fault and the proposed major detachment structure at depth that is supposed to extend further to the east (Smith et al., 2008; Schouten et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2012) cannot be determined based on our data sets alone. However, it is unlikely that the corrugated surface visible in our AUV data is the upper exposed part of the detachment surface proposed by previous studies, as that surface is thought to be at a depth of 1 km beneath the TAG active mound, steepens towards the center of the axial valley, 2-3 km west of the active Mound (DeMartin et al., 2007; Canales et al., 2007), and dips at a much higher angle compared to the low-angle detachment fault associated with the corrugated surface. This implies that the corrugated surface is either superimposed over a larger detachment faults at depth or that the northern part of the hydrothermal field is structurally different from the southern part as suggested by Szitkar et al. (2019). The TAG massif and especially its western part seems to be highly complex and might be formed by a sequence of detachment faults. 
The chaotic zone enclosed by the corrugated surface in the east, Shimmering Mound in the northwest, and the Three Mound area in the south (Fig. 5) appears to be an important area to understand the different crustal processes between the northern and southern section of the mapped area. This part of the eastern flank has been interpreted to be related to large masswasting events (White et al., 1998). However, it cannot be excluded, that the ridges observed in our high-resolution data are instead related to faulting. Several faults and fractures extend into this region, suggesting that it is unlikely that this terrain formed purely by debris flows from the upper flanks further to the east (Fig. 5). Importantly, there is also no prominent concave headwall scarp visible upslope, which would be necessary to produce such an extensive debris fan with a length of almost 2 km and heights of the individual ridges of more than 25 m. Such scars were reported from landslides in the area of the Krasnov and Ashadze hydrothermal fields in the Atlantic (Cannat et al., 2013). Even though a tectonic overprinting of an older debris field cannot be ruled out, a tectonic origin for the chaotic zone seems likely, based on the high-resolution topography. This agrees with the interpretation of high-resolution magnetic data, acquired during our AUV surveys, that led Szitkar et al. (2019) to highlight this location as a ¡°transition zone¡± between crustal blocks of large differences in tilt. 
Even though the heat source driving activity at the active TAG mound might be located beneath the southern part of the hydrothermal field, the lateral extent of the various upflow zones could also span to the area north of Shimmering Mound and the corrugated surface. Unfortunately, we do not have any high-resolution data from this area, and no sulfide occurrences north of Shimmering Mound and the smooth northern block are known to date. Also, stepping further off-axis with high-resolution surveys beyond the Mir Zone did not result in the discovery of additional sulfide occurrences, as most mounds were found close to the intersection of the valley floor with the eastern bounding fault or on the hanging wall section in the western part of the mapped area. The clustering of all known sulfide mounds in a relatively small area and their relative youthfulness (~100,000 years) in comparison to the long evolutional history of the eastern rift valley flank is intriguing. It should be noted, however, that the areal extent of our survey is limited and it cannot be excluded that similarly favorable conditions occurred outside our working area and between the eastern ridges of the TAG massif, especially if these ridges are indeed ¡°rider blocks¡± on a larger and probably older detachment system.  
4.4. Evolution of the eastern flank and hydrothermal activity 
Some dating of hydrothermal precipitates has been carried out (Lalou et al., 1993, 1995, 1998), providing a frame for the development and evolution of the hydrothermal mounds. However, the observations during the M127 cruise showed that the TAG hydrothermal field comprises additional hydrothermal mounds and that distinct morphological differences related to the evolution of the various parts of the vent field also occur.  
The oldest structural unit found in the high-resolution bathymetric data is the uplifted sedimented hummocky terrain in the south-east corner of the working area, at a water depth of 2,800 m (Fig. 8). This volcanic terrain was formed 300 to 400 ka ago (based on the halfspreading rate of 13 mm/y, McGregor et al., 1977) at the valley floor in a similar setting to the current extensional zone, as indicated by the similar fault pattern. With the initiation of the major bounding fault, during a pronounced tectonic phase, this terrain was uplifted by more than 800 m into the upper section of the eastern flank. During this exhumation, the upper faulted terrain was created in the north by continuous normal and transfer faulting. This episode could also be related to the initiation of the detachment fault and the onset of the exhumation of the corrugated surface by the rotation of a normal fault due to localized stress. 
A following magmatic phase created the Mir block, the smooth northern block, and likely parts of the chaotic zone. These blocks were subsequently uplifted along normal faults and, in the case of the smooth northern block, likely dragged onto the detachment surface. During the uplift, these blocks were also highly tectonized and partially covered by mass-wasting products.  
The general structural pattern and the distance to the spreading axis imply that the tectonized areas and the unfissured sections of the hanging wall were largely formed during the same magmatic episode. Even though the ponded flow is not affected by the different fault populations and therefore appears to be young, visual observations (Murton et al., 2018) showed a sediment cover of at least 10-15 cm on top of the lake, which is similar to the sediment depth observed in gravity core samples taken west of the active mound (Petersen and Shipboard Scientific Party, 2016). Hence, there seems to be no major age progression in the volcanic terrain with distance to the spreading axis in this small area. The magmatic phase that formed the main part of the hydrothermal field was succeeded by a phase of ridge-parallel extensional faulting in the eastern part of the valley floor. Unequal movement between the exhumation of the northern detachment, the Mir block, and the valley floor is accommodated in the chaotic zone, resulting in its rough appearance.  
The most recent magmatic phase led to the formation of the neovolcanic ridges in the center of the axial valley observed in the ship-based data sets (Fig. 3). Magmatic activity at the neovolcanic ridges southwest of the hydrothermal field may be related to the propagation of dikes, which intruded along predefined weak zones into the southern area of the hydrothermal field. These dikes may be associated with the small percentage of observed extrusive fissures (Bohnenstiehl and Kleinrock, 2000). Phases of extensional faulting alternated with axis oblique faulting and fracturing, possibly due to shifts in the dominant stress regime. A recent episode of tectonic extension may have led to the rejuvenation of major axis parallel extensional faults east of the active mound (Fig. 4).  
Manganese-oxyhydroxides are the oldest hydrothermal material from the entire TAG hydrothermal field (about 140 ka) and were recovered from the periphery of the Mir Mound. Hence, hydrothermal activity likely started in the east of the valley floor when the Mir Zone was in a distance to the spreading axis similar to the position of the active TAG mound today. The Mir Zone shows signs of oblique and axis perpendicular faulting, but it seems that the block largely stayed intact after the uplift in the lower valley wall and escaped the deviating tectonic stresses.  
In contrast, the highly dissected and sedimented nature of Southern Mound, Double Mound and Rona Mound indicates that these mounds have formed between the uplift of the eastern blocks and the strong spreading-parallel extensional faulting. Shinkai and the smaller New Mounds seem to be spared from this extensional faulting even though they are located only 500 m to the west of the highly faulted mounds. Shinkai and the New Mounds were therefore likely formed after the extensional period that dissected the other mounds in the east. This is in agreement with the unsedimented nature of these mounds that also infers a younger age of the mounds in the west. Unfortunately, there is no published age data for Shinkai or the New Mounds. However, if Shinkai formed during the same time as Southern and Double Mound we would expect a different shape and that the smaller New Mounds would also show some evidence of faulting. Therefore, Shinkai and the two New Mounds might be younger than 40 ka, the youngest age of sulfides reported from the smooth eastern mounds (Double Mound; Lalou et al., 1995). The formation of the steep sulfide mounds in the west might rather correlate with some of the later stages of activity reported for the active TAG mound (excluding the most recent activity pulse that started ca. 80 years ago). Also, Mount de Reliques and mound #24 seem to be unfaulted and appear to be younger than the adjacent Double Mound. Therefore, they might indicate later stages of hydrothermal activity even in the chaotic zone. However, it should be kept in mind that sampling and age dating was scarce and might not be representative for the highly faulted Double and Southern mounds. 
Visual observations from the lower terrace of the active TAG mound (Rona et al., 1986) indicate that venting is often linked to fractures rather than discrete discharge. This and that recent fractures in the sedimented areas just east of the mound suggest recent tectonic activity (Kleinrock and Humphris, 1996a). However, Kong et al. (1992) detected no earthquakes in the immediate vicinity of the active hydrothermal mound or beneath the actively developing faults to the east. The nearest recorded events were reported more than 2 km away and at depths exceeding 4.5 km below seafloor.  Earthquakes detected by Pontbriand and Sohn (2014) close to the active mound are very small and are likely related to the precipitation of anhydrite within the mound and not associated with tectonic activity. 
4.5. Tonnage considerations 
We infer a total sulfide tonnage of about 29 Mt (including 6.7 Mt in the stockwork zones) to be present in the active, weakly-active, and inactive sulfide mounds of the TAG vent field (Table 2). This estimate is based on the volume calculations derived from the AUV-based highresolution topography and assuming a density of 3.5 t/m3. We can test our estimate by comparing it with published tonnage information obtained by drilling of the TAG active mound in 1994. Hannington et al. (1998) reported that 2.7 million tons of sulfide are present in the mound itself with an additional 1.2 million tons contained in the stockwork zone. Their calculations were based on an average density of 3.8 t/m3 determined by Ludwig et al. (1998) on the drill core samples. Our calculation for the TAG active mound indicates a tonnage of 2.3 million tons above the reference surface. This is only slightly lower than the estimate of Hannington et al. (1998) and mainly a result of a slightly lower mound volume (647,000 m3 versus ~700,000 m3) and the lower density used in our calculations (3.5 t/m3). We, therefore, assume our tonnage estimate for the entire hydrothermal field (29 Mt) to be a reasonable estimate. Overall, these 29 Mt are a significant portion of the roughly 600 million tons of sulfide assumed to be present within the neovolcanic zone of the global mid-ocean ridges (Hannington et al., 2010, 2011). Therefore, the TAG segment hosts a significant proportion (~5%) of the global estimate for the neovolcanic zones, which is substantially larger than most SMS deposits known to date (Hannington et al., 2010). It should also be noted that the presence of additional unknown hydrothermal mounds within the TAG hydrothermal field is likely, as some potential targets could not be investigated further due to time constraints. Their presence would increase the total accumulation of sulfide material even more. It is still unknown whether this elevated tonnage is a unique attribute of the TAG hydrothermal field, due to its tectonically complex regional and local geological setting, or if it is instead related to a lack of detailed investigations in other hydrothermal systems thereby underestimating their tonnages. 
Studies from the Central Indian Ridge, also report significant sulfide occurrences from short, tectonically complex ridge segments (e.g. Kairei and Edmond vent fields, Van Dover et al., 2001; Okino et al., 2015), indicating that the tectonic history of a ridge segment plays an important role in the accumulation of sulfides. Furthermore, the estimated 600 Mt global tonnage is a representation of mainly active sites in the neovolcanic zones (~1000 sites) and does not reflect the potential of SMS occurrences on the entire seafloor (Hannington et al., 2010, 2011). Studies from other hydrothermal fields in the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and the Pacific have shown that with an increasing number of high-resolution surveys in the vicinity of known deposits, more inactive deposits are being discovered (Jamieson et al., 2014, Paduan et al., 2018).   
The tonnage reported here for the TAG hydrothermal field is comparable to values reported for ophiolite-hosted mining districts on Cyprus, where single deposits have tonnages of 0.05 to 16 Mt (Hannington et al., 1998). However, the tonnages are substantially lower than values reported from other large mining districts on land (e.g. Abitibi Greenstone Belt, Canada). The amount of sulfide-dominated hydrothermal material within the TAG hydrothermal field amounts to an average of 630 kt/km2, based on an area of 47 km2. However, this value is calculated based on the entire area mapped by the AUV, which does not necessarily represent the extent of the hydrothermal field. Calculating the tonnage in relation to the smallest rectangular dimensions possible for the vent field that includes all known mounds (~14 km2), would increase the potential ore volume to about 2.1 Mt/km2. These values are higher than the values reported from the Endeavour Segment of 0.02 Mt/km2 (Jamieson et al., 2014).  
Assuming an average metal content in the inactive mounds similar to that drilled at the active TAG mound (Cu 2.8 %, Zn 0.4 %, Ag 14 ppm, Au 0.53 ppm; N= 45; Hannington et al., 1998) the field would comprise 804 kt Cu, 110 kt Zn, 402 t Ag, and 15.2 t Au. We use here the weighted average metal content of Hannington et al. (1998) for the interior of the TAG active mound due to a lack in sampling from the interior of the weakly active and inactive mounds. Only a few sulfide samples have been drilled from the upper parts of Southern Mound, Rona Mound, and the Mir Mound in 2016 (Lehrmann et al., 2018, Murton et al., 2019) and their geochemical composition is likely, not representative for the entire mounds. Murton et al. (2019) report copper concentrations averaging 3.1 wt.% Cu (N=19), however, they show clear variations between the mounds. A single sample from Southern Mound has 1.0 wt.-% Cu, while average concentrations of 1.5 wt.% Cu at Rona Mound (N=14) and 9.5 wt.-% at Mir Mound (N=4) are reported. With the exception of a single sample from Rona Mound (8.4 wt.% Zn) the drill core sample suite is characterized by low Zn concentrations and averages 0.6 wt.% Zn (N=19). These values are slightly higher than the average value for the interior of the TAG mound, mostly because of a few high-grade samples from the Mir and Rona mounds. Due to the low sample number and the limited penetration into the mounds we consider the average grade from the TAG active mound published by Hannington et al. (1998) to be a more reasonable estimate for the bulk composition of the inactive and weakly-active mounds. Using these metal grades, the surface metal density for the TAG area would be just over 20.000 t Cu+Zn/km2. These values for the TAG field, however, only include the identified hydrothermal mounds and do not account for any potential accumulation of sulfides in the metalliferous sediments surrounding the mounds or the thick (2-3 m) Cu-rich sediments in the channel-like depression in the deepest parts of the trough south of Rona Mound (Fig. 8 and Fig. 10a). The latter was observed in gravity core samples retrieved during cruises M127 and JC138 (Petersen and Shipboard Scientific Party, 2016; Murton et al., 2019). The lateral extent of these metalliferous sediments is not known. However, based on the topography, the retrieved sediment cores, and observations made during M127 and JC138 we inferred that thick hydrothermal sediments occur in the surroundings of all larger mounds (Fig. 10), commonly below a layer of pelagic sediment. The channel-like depression likely received input through mass transport of sulfides and other hydrothermal components from the erosion of the adjacent Southern, Rona, and Abyss Mound, but probably even from the distal Mir Zone (indicated by the white arrows in Fig. 10). 
4.6. Sulfide accumulation rates 
Assuming a constant spreading rate (12¨C13 mm/yr) over the last five hundred thousand years, the crust hosting the oldest known sulfides in the TAG vent field around the Mir Zone (4 km distance to the spreading center), may not be older than 300,000 years. Our results indicate that sulfide formation is related to large scale faulting following this volcanic phase. The oldest record of hydrothermal activity in the area, determined from hydrothermal manganese crusts collected at the Mir Mound and from the low-temperature zone in the east, indicates a minimum age of hydrothermal activity of 125,000 to 140,000 years (Lalou et al., 1986, 1993). Dating of hydrothermal precipitates indicates that high-temperature sulfide formation at the Mir Mound started around 100,000 years ago (Lalou et al., 1993). The formation of 29 Mt of sulfides in a 100,000-year period would result in an accumulation rate of ~300 t/y. However, episodic hydrothermal venting has been proposed by age gaps identified from dating of the hydrothermal deposits in the area. Lalou et al. (1995) suggest that, over a ~50,000-year history, hydrothermal activity at the active TAG mound has been confined to only 20 % of this time. If we assume a similar episodic activity for the other inactive sulfide mounds, sulfide accumulation rates for the entire field over the last 100,000 years could amount to ~1,500 t/y during ~20,000 years of hydrothermal activity. This rate lies above the published range of estimated accumulation rates that vary from 1 to 800 t/y (compiled in Jamieson et al., 2014) that include everything from individual black smokers to entire vent fields. Hannington et al. (1998) calculated a value of between 500-1000 t/y for periods of hydrothermal activity at the active TAG mound, while the accumulation rate for all active and inactive sulfides along the entire Endeavour segment was estimated to be about 400 t/y (Jamieson et al., 2014). The sulfide accumulation rate within the entire TAG hydrothermal field is likely not significantly higher than that of other hydrothermal systems. However, it is the duration of hydrothermal activity in a confined area that raises the sulfide tonnage at the TAG hydrothermal field above average when compared to other vent fields. 

5.Conclusions 
By combining multi-resolution bathymetric data sets, we were able to significantly advance our understanding of the relationships between the volcanic, tectonic, and hydrothermal features and processes associated with the TAG hydrothermal field. Our conclusions can be summarized as follows. 
1.The active TAG mound and the sulfide mounds in the Three Mound area are located at the intersection of different fault and fissure populations that mark distinct tectonic zones that relate to temporal changes in the prevailant stress regime. 
2.The presence of a corrugated surface in the north of the field adds complexity to the structural control on hydrothermal venting and contributes to its longevity.  
3.The Mir Mound, Southern Mound, and Shimmering Mound are located close to major faults that might intersect the detachment faults at depth, enabling the low-temperature hydrothermal activity. 
4.The inactive to weakly-active sulfide mounds are of different age indicating temporal and regional variability in the location of upflow zones from an undefined heat source at depth. 
5.The estimated sulfide tonnage for the TAG vent field is ~29 Mt, including an estimated 30% of subsurface stockwork mineralization. Most (~90 %) of the hydrothermal material lies in inactive and weakly-active sulfide mounds, highlighting the importance of developing new exploration methods that do not rely on water column anomalies caused by a buoyant plume.  
6.The location of the inactive and weakly-active mounds along the margin of a larger detachment system and the discovery of new mounds during cruise M127 indicates that there is still potential for further discoveries within the area and possibly even further off-axis between the large ridges further to the east. 
7.The calculated sulfide accumulation rate is ~1.500 t/y, assuming that hydrothermal activity occurred only during 20% of the estimated 100,000-year history of venting at this site, and is higher than that reported from other modern seafloor vent fields. However, the TAG vent field is not characterized by a different and more powerful type of hydrothermal activity. It is the tectonic control and longevity of the system that confines sulfide formation into a small area. 
There is a need to extend the survey area to the north and east away from the axis in order to fully quantify the extent of hydrothermal deposition. This would also provide additional information about the evolution of the eastern flank and the geographic extent of the hydrothermal convection cell. Petrological sampling along the eastern wall is lacking and would help in reconstructing the tectonic evolution of the TAG segment. Further investigations in the sedimented areas between the large, linear ridges to the east may also provide information about the sequence of hydrothermal activity and shed light on possible hydrothermal activity east of the known TAG vent field.  
Abstract
We present a linear controller and observer design
for autonomous underwater gliders based on a
model of glider dynamics that we have derived. Our
focus is on buoyancy-propelled, fixed-wing gliders
with attitude controlled by means of internal mass
distribution. In cases when some states cannot be
directly measured, such as with oceangoing gliders,
the design of an observer offers possible improvements
over current glider control methods.
1 Introduction
Initially conceived by Henry Stommel [16], autonomous
underwater gliders offer many advantages
in ocean sensing: superior spatial and temporal
measurement density, longer duration missions and
greater operational 
exibility. Several oceangoing
gliders are operational or under development, including
the SLOCUM glider [18], the "Spray" glider
[14] and the "Seaglider" [3]. These are all buoyancypropelled,
fixed-winged gliders which shift internal
ballast to control attitude.
On SLOCUM, the ballast tanks are configured
within the vehicle to provide the proper pitching
moment during upwards and downwards glides
[17, 18]. A sliding battery mass is used for fine adjustments
in pitch and roll. Sensors measure depth,
pitch, roll, and compass heading. Vehicle position
at the surface is determined through GPS fix. The
pitch angle, an assumed angle of attack, and a vertical
speed computed from depth measurements are
used to estimate the horizontal speed of the glider.
The glider control system periodically checks the
glider attitude and adjusts the position of the sliding
battery mass. Switching between downwards
and upwards glides is performed open loop, i.e., the
ballast is changed and the sliding mass is moved to
a new position.
Sensing and control on other gliders is similar.
For example, Spray performs active control of pitch
and roll every 40s using measured pitch and heading
errors. In the case of pitch, a low-gain proportional
control law is used, and in the case of heading, proportional
plus integral control is used [14].
The goal of our work is to improve upon currently
implemented glider control strategies. Our aim is
to develop a widely applicable approach, complementing
efforts on SLOCUM, Spray and Seaglider.
Toward that end we have developed a nonlinear
glider dynamic model and examined the use of linear
controllers and observers. A model-based approachmay
also prove useful in determining optimal
glider motions (see [2] for early work in this direction).
Our glider dynamic model is derived in [10],
where we examine steady glides, controllability and
observability in the vertical plane.
In this paper we review the derivation from [10]
and present a controller design that uses a linear
observer. Because of space and power constraints,
and because of the diffculties of underwater sensing,
many operational gliders do not carry the sensors
necessary to determine the full glider dynamic
state. In particular, glider position and velocity are
costly to measure directly. We design a dynamic
observer to estimate the glider state from a limited
set of measurements. These estimated states can be
used to determine horizontal glider motion instead
of the current methods which rely on assumptions
of constant angle of attack.
Our dynamic glider model describes a glider with
simple body and wing shape. Control is applied to
two point masses inside the vehicle: we control the
mass of a point with fixed position and the forces on
a mass with variable position. The model describes
the nonlinear coupling between the vehicle and the
shifting and changing mass. Analysis and control
law design is performed for the dynamics specialized
to the vertical plane.
In related work with colleagues, we address issues
in optimal path planning for underwater gliders
[2] and in coordinating control for a network of
autonomous underwater vehicles [1, 9, 15].
In Section 2 we describe our laboratory-scale
glider ROGUE, see Figure 1.1. ROGUE controls
buoyancy and CG position by means of a distributed
array of independently actuated ballast tanks (syringes).
In Section 3, we derive the equations of motion
for a buoyancy-driven, fixed-wing underwater
glider. Controllability and observability of steady
glide paths in the vertical plane are studied in Section
4. Linear observers and linear control laws are
developed in Section 5 for stabilizing these glide
paths in the presence of disturbances. A simulation
of the controlled glider modelled to resemble
ROGUE is also presented. We give final remarks in
Section 6.
2 The ROGUE gliding vehicle
ROGUE is a laboratory-scale gliding vehicle designed
for experiments in glider dynamics and control.
The vehicle consists of a water-tight body,
modular wings and tail, internal ballast actuators,
and on-board electronics and batteries. Using its
on-board computer and sensors the vehicle is capable
of autonomous or remote operation. ROGUE's
ellipsoidal body has axes of length 18, 12 and 6
inches. The vehicle body contains the vehicle actuators,
power, computer and sensors, and has mounts
for the modular vehicle wings and tail. Different sets
of wings and tail can be attached to perform experiments
with different vehicle hydrodynamic profiles.
We note that the body and wings have not been designed
for optimal gliding performance but rather in
consideration of available facilities and other manufacturing
constraints. Experiments are currently
planned using the ROGUE vehicle in our twentyone-
foot diameter laboratory tank and in an olympic
sized pool at Princeton University.
In the configuration shown in Figure 2.1, each
wing has span of 28 inches with aspect ratio 9.3.
The wings are symmetric airfoils from [13] for low
Reynolds number. The tail was sized using standard
aircraft rules as in [4] and [11] . The vertical
tail is designed to give yaw stability in forward glides
and is modular, allowing tail volume to be changed.
The glider body, wings and tail are all machined
from UHMW (ultra-high molecular weight) plastic.
In Figure 2.1 the top half of the vehicle is separated
from the bottom so the internal components
are visible. The metal box at the center of the vehicle
contains the vehicle on-board computer. Two
syringe-type ballast tanks are visible, one on each
side of the computer housing. Visible to the left of
each ballast tank is its driving servo (they appear as
black squares). To the right of the computer housing
are two white battery packs.
ROGUE contains three Nickel-Cadmium battery
packs to provide power to the vehicle actuators,
computer and sensors. Two "8-packs" of AA batteries
power the computer, sensors and signal conditioning
electronics. A "4-pack" of AA batteries
powers the servos and vehicle optional R/C receiver.
ROGUE contains four independently actuated
syringe-style ballast tanks aligned along the vehicle
long axis, two mounted on each side of the vehicle
centerline. The two ballast tanks in the upper half
of the vehicle point forwards, while the two in the
lower half point to the aft of the vehicle. Each tank
is made of a clear plastic cylinder with an internal
plunger. Ball screw mechanisms with a high torque
modified RC servo drive each ballast tank. The tank
connects to the vehicle exterior via tubing. Moving
the plunger inside each ballast tank transfers water
from the tank to outside the vehicle or the reverse.
Filling the tanks with different amounts of water
causes ROGUE to become positively or negatively
buoyant and moves the CG relative to the vehicle
centroid. Each tank has a 100 mL capacity for .4"
of plunger travel. Together the four tanks have a
400 g capacity. The relative positions of the four
tanks allows for moderate adjustments in the vehicle
CG position. The high torque servos driving
the plungers connect to linear potentiometers and
use feedback control to regulate the tank's plunger
position. The tanks are filled completely with water
before ROGUE is deployed to eliminate any air
bubbles in the tanks.
ROGUE's on-board computer is a TattleTale
Model 8. The TattleTale Model 8 is based on the
Motorola 68332 chip and also includes a PIC 16C64
chip for low-power operation. The TattleTale allows
up to 8 analog inputs and up to 25 digital input/
output signals. The Motorola 68332 chip contains
a central processor as well as a "time processing
unit (TPU)" capable of performing simple
clock functions independently of the main processor.
There are 12 TPU channels available to the Tattle-
Tale user, each of which can generate a clock signal,
measure the duty cycle of a square wave signal,
etc. Electronics have been added to multiplex the
analog input signals doubling the computer's analog
input capacity to 16 channels. The TattleTale
Model 8 includes 256 kilobytes of RAM (temporary
memory) and 256 kilobytes of 
ash EEPROM (permanent
memory). The memory can be expanded to
any size available on a PCMCIA memory expansion
card.
ROGUE's computer serves three major purposes:
to store sensor data, process sensor data according
to a pre-defined feedback control law, and apply
command signals to ROGUE's actuators according
to a feedback control law or to a remote command
from a modified R/C transmitter.
TattleTale programs are written in C and compiled
on a host computer. Programs may be downloaded
from PC to TattleTale via serial link to the
RAM or to EEPROM. The TattleTale is housed
within a metal box to shield it from interference.
Also mounted within the metal box is an optional
R/C receiver for remote operation of the vehicle.
ROGUE's sensor suite includes the following elements:
two depth sensors, two single-axis inclinometers
mounted to measure pitch and roll angles,
and three angular rate sensors mounted to measure
pitch, roll and yaw rates. The vehicle also contains
analog preamplifiers for each of the sensors.
The amplifiers and angular sensors are mounted in
a metal box in the lower half of the vehicle. The
two pressure sensors are differential wet/wet sensors
located at the fore and aft of the vehicle hull and
are connected to the vehicle exterior and interior by
tubing. The pressure sensors are used to measure
depth. All sensors are connected to the on-board
computer for logging data and performing feedback
control using sensor data.
3 Glider Dynamics
The variables used in this paper are defined in Table
3.1.
3.1 Equations of Motion in 3D
We first review the derivation of the equations of
motion for our underwater glider. For a more detailed
derivation see [10]. Our choice of glider body
and wing configuration is motivated by the designs
of ROGUE, SLOCUM, Spray and Seaglider. We
model the underwater glider as a rigid body with
fixed wings (and tail) immersed in a 
uid with buoyancy
control and controlled internal moving mass.
We take the hull to be ellipsoidal with wings and tail
attached so that the center of buoyancy (CB) is at
the center of the ellipsoid. We assign a coordinate
frame fixed on the vehicle body to have its origin at
the CB and its axes aligned with the principle axes
of the ellipsoid. Let body axis 1 lie along the long
axis of the vehicle (positive in the direction of the
nose of the glider), let body axis 2 lie in the plane
of the wings and body axis 3 point in the direction
orthogonal to the wings as shown in Figure 3.1.
The total stationary mass, ms, (also referred to
as body mass) is the sum of three terms: mh is a
fixed mass that is uniformly distributed throughout
the ellipsoid, mw is a fixed point mass that may be
offset from the CB, and mb is the variable ballast
point mass which is fixed in location at the CB.
The vector from the CB to the point mass mw is
rw. The vector from the CB to the center of mass
of the stationary mass ms = mh +mw +mb is rs.
The moving internal point mass is m. The vector
rp(t) describes the position of this mass with respect
to the CB at time t. The total mass of the vehicle
is then
The mass of the displaced 
uid is denoted m and
we define m0 = mv-m so that the vehicle is negatively
(positively) buoyant if is negative (positive).
The different masses and position vectors are
illustrated in Figure 3.2.
Let Jh denote the inertia matrix, with respect to
the body frame, for the uniformly distributed mass
mh. Define the operator ^ so that for a vector x =
(x1; x2; x3)T ,
Equivalently, for vector y = (y1; y2; y3)T , ^xy =
xy. The inertia matrix for the stationary (body)
mass expressed with respect to body frame coordinates
is
Since the variable ballast mass mb is a point mass
located at the CB, it does not contribute to Js, and
in particular Js is a constant.
The orientation of the glider is given by the rotation
matrix R. R maps vectors expressed with
respect to the body frame into inertial frame coordinates.
The position of the glider b = (x; y; z)T is
the vector from the origin of the inertial frame to the
origin of the body frame (vehicle CB) as shown in
Figure 3.3. The vehicle moves through the 
uid with
translational velocity v = (v1; v2; v3)T and angular
velocity 
 = (
1;
2;
3)T , expressed with respect
to the body frame. (Note that we have diverged
from the notation typical of the submarine literature
where v = (u; v;w)T and 
 = (p; q; r)T . The
notation that we use here is taken from texts in classical
mechanics such as [5] and is more convenient
for the derivation and analysis.) In this notation,
the kinematics of the glider are given by
Let P be the momentum of the vehicle-
fluid system
expressed with respect to the body frame. Let
 be the total angular momentum about the origin
of the body frame. Let Pp represent the point mass
momentum with respect to the body frame. We differentiate
the expressions relating the momenta P,
, and Pp to the momenta in the inertial frame.
Applying the kinematic expressions (3.2) and (3.1),
then applying Newton's laws, gives the following dynamic
equations in body coordinates:
where all vectors are expressed with respect to the
inertial frame. The vector xi locates the point of
application of the force fexti with respect to the inertial
coordinate frame. fexti is an external force
applied to the system and extj is a pure external
torque. k is a unit vector pointing in the direction of
gravity. These external forces and torques include
those due to gravity and buoyancy; however, gravity
is included explicitly in the third set of equations
as it is the only external force acting on the movable
point mass. is the internal force applied from the vehicle
body onto the point mass (a control force) in body coordinates.
Define the control vector
To derive expressions for P, , and Pp, we determine
the total kinetic energy of the glider-
uid
system. Let Ts be the kinetic energy of the rigid
body with mass ms and inertia matrix Js. Let vp
be the absolute velocity of the movable point mass
m expressed in body coordinates. Given that the
velocity of m relative to the body frame is r_p, we
compute
The kinetic energy Tp of the movable point mass is
then computed to be
Kirchhogff [8] showed that the kinetic energy of an
unbounded volume of ideal 
uid due to the motion
of an immersed rigid body takes the form
whereMf is the added mass matrix, Jf is the added
inertia matrix and Df is the added cross term.
These matrices depend upon the external shape of
the body and the density of the 
uid. We assume
that at low angle of attack, the contribution of the
wings is dominated by lift and drag forces. Thus,
we make the simplifying assumption that the added
mass and inertia terms can be computed solely from
the vehicle hull.
The total vehicle 
uid kinetic energy T = Ts +
Tp + Tf is computed to be
Since the vehicle hull is ellipsoidal (we neglect the
wings in this instance), Mf and Jf are diagonal
and Df = 0. Let Mf = diag(mf1;mf2;mf3) and
Jf = diag(Jf1; Jf2; Jf3). Define
where I is the 3 * 3 identity matrix. Let M =
diag(m1;m2;m3) and J = diag(J1; J2; J3). Furthermore,
assume that mw = 0 so that rs = 0.
We can then compute the momenta as
Inverting these relationships then gives the body
velocities in terms of the body momenta. To get
the equations of motion in terms of body velocities,
we differentiate the equation for the body velocities
with respect to time. We assume that buoyancy
is changed in a symmetric way (e.g., ballast
is pumped on and off board in streams with the
appropriate symmetry) so that there is negligible
associated thrust or moment on the glider. Let the
ballast control input u4 be defined as
Dififerentiating the body velocities
then substituting for the derivatives and substituting (3.9)
for the relationship between momenta and velocity, the
complete equations of motion for the underwater glider moving 
in threedimensional space are refer to external forces and moments, in this case
lift and drag, with respect to the body frame.
3.2 Equations of Motion in the Vertical Plane
We now specialize the model to the vertical plane,
the i-k plane in inertial coordinates and the e1-e3
plane in body coordinates. The elements of R, b, v,

, rp, Pp, and u corresponding to the e2 direction
are set to zero. The equations of motion (3.11) for
space are the gliding vehicle restricted to the vertical plane
are then
Here, is pitch angle,  is the angle of attack, D
is drag, L is lift and MDL is the viscous moment as
shown in Figure 3.4. These forces and moment are
modelled as
where the K's are constant coeffcients. This model
is a standard one, derived using airfoil theory and
potential 
ow calculations and then verified using
experimental observations, see for example [4, 11].
The method for determination of the coeffcients is
described in Section 4.3.
As shown in Figure 3.4, we denote the glide path
angle by  where
We also denote the glider speed by V where
We will typically specify a glide path by desired glide
path angle  and desired speed . We define inertial
coordinates such that  coincides with
the desired path:
Then, measures the vehicle's perpendicular distance
to the desired path. We define two gliding objectives:
GO1 The objective is to control only the direction
and speed of the vehicle's glide path. In this
case we need not consider x and z at all.
GO2 The objective is to control gliding along a prescribed
line (see Figure 3.5). In this case we will
include (but exclude) in our analysis and
we aim to make
In several glider designs the moving mass is restricted
to one degree of freedom in the planar case.
This case is addressed in [10].
4 Controllability of Steady
Glide Paths
In this section we compute steady glide paths. We
then study controllability and observability of these
glide paths.
4.1 Gliding Equilibria
We prescribe a desired glide path by specifying the
desired glide path angle and the desired speed
Vd. We denote with subscript "d" the value of all
dynamic variables at the glide equilibria. To get
the conditions for such planar gliding equilibria, we
set the left hand side of equations (3.24) and (3.14)
through (3.22) to zero.
With their left hand sides set to zero and given
, equations (3.16) and (3.17) may be solved for
. We can then compute
mbd can then be solved again using (3.16) and
(3.17). Finally, equation (3.15) with left hand side
set to zero gives a one-parameter family of solutions
for (rP1d; rP3d )T .
First, we compute from equations (3.16) and
(3.17) with left hand sides zero. This yields a
quadratic equation for. 
2, we have
Equation (4.1) may be solved for a realizable fid
provided the discriminant of the quadratic equation
is greater than or equal to zero. Evaluating the
condition on the discriminant in the range (will 
give a range of possible glide path angles d
depending on the glider hydrodynamic parameters.
See [10]. Since the drag model is valid only at small
angles of attack, we take  as the solution of (4.1)
with smaller magnitude.
The special case of is covered in [10].
We may determine mbd from (3.16) and (3.17),
Finally, we may solve for a one-parameter family
of sliding mass locations (rP1d; rP3d )T which satisfy
equation (3.15). The family of solutions is
and where 
 is a real number. The vector 
is a particular solution of equation (3.15). Since
is the direction of gravity
in body coordinates, is orthogonal to the
direction of gravity and 
 measures the vehicle's
"bottom-heaviness" as shown in Figure 4.1.
For an experimental vehicle, rP3 may be a more
physically relevant choice of parameter than 
.
Equilibrium mass locations in this case are addressed
in [10].
4.2 Linearization
We determine the linearization for the planar
glider about a steady glide path. Let 
Then the linearized system is
where we have abbreviated and
The notation  indicates that the quantity is to
be evaluated at the desired equilibrium.
4.3 Controllability
In this section we describe controllability and observabililty
of steady glide paths for a model of
our experimental vehicle ROGUE, described in Section
2. Mass and inertia properties were measured
directly. Added mass and inertia properties can be
found, for example, in [7]. Lift and drag for the
body were found experimentally as described in [6].
Lift and drag for the wings were taken from the data
in [13]. Lift for the body plus wings was then computed
using Schrenk's method [12], and drag was
computed as the sum of the drag on the wing and
the body. The lift moment was approximated by 
taking into account the tail. The vehicle mode
l parameters are given as follows
The first three masses, m, mh and m were measured
with a high degree of accuracy. The other terms
have less precision because they are based on lookup
tables and approximation methods.
Four steady glide paths are calculated using the
method of Section 4.1. The glide paths are at glide
angles 30, 45, 30 and 45. We compute the
glib de path at 30 by choosing a desired glide speed
Vd = 0:30 m/s and a desired vertical location of the
movable mass given by rP3d = 4 cm. This results in
an equilibrium variable mass given by mbd = 1:36
kg. The glide path at 45 is computed for these
same values of rP3d and mbd . The corresponding
equilibrium speed for this glide is computed as Vd =
:37 m/s.Similarly, we computed the two steady
upward glide paths, for the same value of rP3d and
the same buoyant force magnitude, i.e., the value of
jm0d j is held constant. Recall that m0 is the mass of
the vehicle mv less the mass of the displaced 
uid
m. The full description of each of the four glide
paths is given in Table 4.1.
Local properties of these steady glide paths can
be studied using the linearization of Section 4.2. By
plugging in the equilibrium values, we can examine
the linearization for stability, controllability and observability.
The four glide paths listed in Table 4.1
all have a relatively slow unstable mode. They are
all, however, locally controllable. That is, A and B
as given by (4.6) and (4.7), when evaluated at any
of the four equilibria, satisfy the controllability rank
condition. Note that the linearization includes the
state z meaning that controllability extends to the
variable z. Accordingly, we can successfully design
a linear controller that will locally accomplish not
only glide objective GO1 but also GO2.
It is of interest to check the controllability rank
condition in the case that the movable mass m can
only move in one direction (i.e., rP3 is fixed). To do
this we have linearized the equations of motion for
the single degree-of-freedom moving mass derived in
[10]. Again the new A and B matrices for this case,
when evaluated at any of the above four glide paths,
satisfy the controllability rank condition. Thus, it
seems that at least for linear type control action, not
much is lost in restricting the degrees of freedom of
the movable mass from two to one. Several operational
gliders have moving masses that translate in
the vehicle long axis and rotate in the roll direction,
corresponding to a design with one degree of
freedom when considering only the vertical plane.
The movable mass m for ROGUE is approximately
1/6 of the vehicle displacement m. This is of
the same relative order as the movable mass in the
gliders SLOCUM, Spray and Seaglider. Variations
in this mass or its location will not in principle affect
local controllability of a feasible glide path, but
may affect the range of feasible glide paths and the
switching between them.
4.4 Observability and State Estimation
Observability of the linearized model about the four
glide paths listed in Table 4.1 was also investigated.
If GO1 is our objective, i.e., if we are interested in
controlling only the direction and speed of the vehicle's
glide path, then we need not measure z
0. The nine-dimensional dynamic model (which excludes
z) is completely observable with measurements limited
to movable mass position rp1, rp3 and variable
mass mb. In this case, pitch angle , pitch rate 
2,
linear velocity components v1 and v3 and the momentum
of the movable mass Pp1, Pp3 need not be
sensed. Observability means that with the measurements
of rp1, rp3 and mb, a dynamic observer could
be designed to give an estimate of the unmeasured
states , 
2, v1, v3, Pp1 and Pp3. Of course,  is
typically already measured and 
2 is not so hard to
measure, so the real advantage is in the estimation
of v1, v3, Pp1 and Pp3 which are more difficult to
measure. The nine-dimensional dynamic model is
also completely observable with measurements limited
to , rp1 (or rp3) and mb. Again this means
that using these three measurement signals, an observer
could be designed to estimate the rest of the
states.
We note that the use of a dynamic observer to
estimate the glider states has the potential to improve
the accuracy of horizontal motion determination
over current methods which are based on assumptions
of constant angle of attack, etc. For example,
on SLOCUM, the horizontal motion of the
glider during the glide is estimated from GPS fixes
taken at the surface, measured pitch angle, an assumed
angle of attack and vertical speed computed
from depth measurements [17]. Similarly, on Spray,
horizontal 
ight distance is calculated based on a
constant pitch, heading and angle of attack to which
the vehicle is being controlled [14].
If GO2 is our objective, i.e., if we want to control
the glider to a prescribed line in the plane, then
we need a measurement of z. Recall from (3.23)
that z depends on both depth z, which is easily
measured, and horizontal position x, which is not
so easily measured. The measurements rp1, rp3 and
mb, together with a measurement of z (or alternatively
, rp1, mb and z), do not render x observable.
This means that without an initial condition measurement
x(0), the trajectory x(t) cannot be computed,
and so z is not observable. That is, using
any combination of the other nine states, it is not
possible to design a dynamic observer to estimate
the z state. However, with an initial measurement
of x given say from a GPS fix taken when the glider
is at the surface, the horizontal motion of the glider
can be dead reckoned using velocity estimates from
the observer. This introduces some error z ded
into the estimate of the z state. Using the deduced
ded in the feedback control, the glider can perform
GO2, gliding along or parallel to the desired glide
path with some offset in the z direction due to dead
reckoning error.
The dead reckoning approach involves calculating
horizontal velocity, then integrating to obtain
a deduced.
This can then be used to calculate 
ded. The pitch angle and depth z can be measured directly.
Estimates of the velocities, v1est and v3est, are provided
by the observer, while is determined by the desired glide.
The equation for the dead reckoned is then
The nine observable states include v1 and v3 so our
observer estimates v1est and v3est will converge to
the actual states when we are close enough to the
equilibrium glide path for the linearization to be
valid. When there is some error in the observer
estimate of the velocities, integrating (4.8) to find
xded and using (4.9) will result in some error. 
This error depends on the observer state
estimate error, which will vary with different state
trajectories and disturbances.
5 Controlled Planar Gliding With Observer
In this section we demonstrate, in simulation, controlled
gliding in the vertical plane by designing
and testing a linear controller and observer for the
glide path moving 30 downward as described in Table
4.1. Since the controller is linear, we expect that
it should take initial conditions nearby to the 30
downward glide path. We demonstrate this result
by starting the glider at the  45 downward steady
glide and using the linear controller to move it to
the 30 downward glide solely by feedback.
5.1 Controller Design
We address the case where only a limited set of the
states are measured, depending on the sensors on
the glider. We design the controller and then, given
the limited set of state measurements, design a dynamic
observer to determine the full state of the
glider. The controller is designed for the linearization
about the 30 downward glide using the LQR
(linear quadratic regulator) method. This is a standard
linear optimal control design method which
produces a stabilizing control law that minimizes a
cost function that is a weighted sum of the squares
of the states and input variables.
The cost function to be minimized is defined as
where Q and R are state and control penalty matrices.
Q and R were chosen to ensure well-behaved
dynamics and to prevent large motions in the movable
mass position and variable mass that would exceed
physical limitations. Taking into account real or 
desirable maximum state values, the states associated
with vehicle and movable mass velocity and
variable mass and pitch angle were weighted most
heavily. No significant tuning was performed. The
weight selections are given by
Q = diag(:05; :5; 1; 2; 2; :1; :1; 1; 1; :5);
R = diag(1; 1; 1):
The corresponding control law is  where
K is computed using MATLAB as the solution to
the Riccati equation given A;B; Q;R.
5.2 Observer Design
In the case that some states are not provided by
sensor data, as is likely to be the case with velocities
v1 and v3 in an autonomous glider, it is possible
to construct a linear optimal observer to estimate
the unavailable states. As described in Section 4.3
the nine dimensional dynamic model excluding is
completely observable. If is not directly sensed, it
is an unobservable state but can be dead reckoned.
The construction of an optimal linear observer for
the nine dimensional system proceeds in a similar
manner to the construction of the LQR controller.
Our linear system is described by A and B, de-
fined above. The system output is y = Cx + v,
where C is the system output matrix determined
by the available sensors and v is noise. Given a linear
time invariant system subject to additive process
disturbance w(t) and measurement noise v(t)
which are zero mean, gaussian, white noise processes,
an observer which minimizes variance in the
estimate error is derived in a manner similar to the
LQR. The cost function to be minimized is
where is the system zerostate
response to plant disturbance 
and is the zero-state response
to measurement noise. Let and  represent the
white-noise processes w(t) and v(t) , where the
Dirac Delta Function represents the fact that
white noise is uncorrelated in time. Let W =
and  be the disturbance and
noise covariance matrices. Then choosing observer
feedback  minimizes the cost function
J0, where P is the solution to the observer matrix
Riccati equation given A; C;W; V .
In this observer design the W and V matrices
are chosen according to reasonable estimates of the
disturbances and noise. The covariance matrix W
is a diagonal matrix whose elements are the square
of the standard deviation of the state disturbances.
The standard deviation is taken to be ten percent of
the desired value at the equilibrium glide for each
state. In the cases where a state xi has desired
value zero, we determined a maximum deviation
4xi from equilibrium by simulating several switches
between equilibrium glides under full state feedback
control. Ten percent of 4xi is then used as the
standard deviation for the i
th state. The noise covariance
matrix V depends on the noise properties
of the sensors used in the vehicle. In this design
they are taken to be of the same or smaller order of
magnitude as W:
When determining the cost function to be minimized,
if V is large then computed gain L will be
small, so direct measurements have smaller impact
on the state estimate. A large W implies disturbances
dominate the plant dynamics. In that case
computed gain L is large, resulting in an observer
state estimate which depends more heavily on sensor
measurements than the plant model.
5.3 Glider Simulation
In Figures 5.1-5.3 we show a MATLAB simulation
of the glider switching from a 45 downward glide
to a 30 downward glide path. This is accomplished
by turning off the controller for the first glide at
t = 5 seconds and turning on the linear controller
for the second glide. In each figure we show results
using full state feedback and using an observer to
estimate the state used in the control law.
When calculating the controller gain matrix K
and the observer gain matrix L, some plant parameter
error is incorporated into the design. When calculating
the gain matrices using the respective Riccati
equations, the parameters which determine the
A and B matrices are varied by up to ten percent.
Changing the A and B matrices used as the system
model in the controller and observer design represents
imperfect knowledge of the glider dynamic coeffcients.
In Figure 5.1 we show the glide path before and
after the switch. In Figure 5.2 we show plots of position,
pitch, linear and angular velocity as a function
of time and in Figure 5.3 we show the position of
the movable mass, the net buoyant force as well as
the control inputs as a function of time. The figures
show that the 45 downward glide path is in the region
of attraction of the linear controller designed
for the 30 downward glide path. Furthermore, the
transient is well behaved.
6 Final Remarks
Laboratory experiments of controlled gliding with
ROGUE will be described in a future publication.
Experiments with ROGUE are planned to provide
verification of our dynamic model and to test the
controller and observer designs. We also plan to
realize these and future results on sea-worthy gliders
such SLOCUM in collaboration with our colleagues
who build and operate these vehicles.
Other future work includes extending the glider
control design to motions in the horizontal plane
such as waypoint following, control of unsteady motions,
and three dimensional motions such as gliding
in a spiral. We intend to develop the glider control
methodology further by investigating nonlinear
feedback control laws, feedforward control and path
planning. Work with colleagues on optimal control
theory which is applicable to glider path planning
appears in [2].
Work is underway to develop decentralized control
laws to produce underwater vehicles that school
like fish [9, 15]. By developing control schemes for
coordinated group motion of underwater vehicles,
we hope to produce a network of gliders that can
serve as a fast and effective ocean sensing platform.
For example, in [1], decentralized control algorithms
are described that allow a pair of vehicles to climb
a spatially distributed gradient. In support of this
effort we are building an experimental, underwater
test-bed for multiple-vehicle control [1]. Vehicle systems,
including control systems, hardware and software,
and new sensors developed for the experimental
grouping vehicle in [1] may also be incorporated
into the design of future laboratory gliders.

I. INTRODUCTION 
An underwater glider is a type of autonomous underwater 
vehicle (AUV) that uses buoyancy control in conjunction with 
wings to convert vertical motion to horizontal motion in a sawtooth 
pattern and thereby propelling itself in forward direction 
with very low power consumption [1]. They use buoyancy and 
wings to produce forward motion for long duration ranging 
from weeks to months and cover distances over 3000 km 
[2].There are more than 50 different AUGs developed for 
research and commercial purposes. Much theoretical and 
experimental analysis has been carried out on glider dynamics 
[3, 4], glider design and development for payload and 
maneuverability [5, 6], performance and stability analysis [7, 
8], trajectory control analysis [9, 10] and path planning [9, 11] 
based on different controller techniques[12].The majority of 
these gliders use classical controllers such as ProportionalIntegral-
Derivative (PID) and Linear Quadratic Regulator 
(LQR). However, These control methods cannot provide 
simultaneously easy control implementation and fast 
convergence speed for stabilization in the presence of 
continuously varying water current [13]. 
In this paper, existing underwater glider control strategies 
are reviewed with emphasis on their actuation system that 
includes wings and rudder control, followed by external effects 
of water current and variable loads which influence their 
motion. 
No work to date achieved the control of fully under actuated 
vehicles via dynamic modelling with the presence of external 
varying forces such as water current and advanced controller 
design to compensate these problems and then implement them 
to underwater gliders. In order to overcome these issues, 
serious design and implementation considerations are required 
for robust control approach. 
II. UNDERWATER GLIDER MOTION CONTROL 
The motion of an underwater gliders depends upon a 
buoyancy control system combined with a set of wings and 
rudder to move in vertical and horizontal direction through a 
water column [14]. The glider descends and ascends in water 
column due to control of buoyancy engine, which consists of 
oil filled bladder or piston evacuated cylinder. Buoyancy is 
controlled to be slightly positive or negative due to which a 
glider can move with almost zero power consumption with 
limited speed [15]. For example, the Spray glider as shown in 
Figure 1, has a maximum speed of 0.35 m/sec but can operate 
for up to six months. 
Regardless of the design, gliders depend on vertical space to 
operate efficiently but cannot resist with strong currents, which 
ultimately creates a problem to control motion and trajectory. 
On the other hand, the average horizontal speed of underwater 
gliders is about 0.3 m/s. The low speed limitation has created 
challenges in controller performance such as control of vehicle 
orientation, position and velocity [14]. There is a direct effect 
of environmental forces including winds, wave and surface 
currents upon the motion of underwater gliders and AUVs [21]. 
These effects may be compensated through an effective control 
strategy. Therefore the control strategy should be chosen to 
reduce the effect of these disturbances. However, the 
challenges associated with control of underwater gliders 
include a highly nonlinear dynamic system and complex 
hydrodynamic effects. Different control strategies for 
laboratory scale and commercial scale have been implemented 
to underwater vehicles which are discussed in table 1. 
The ALBAC glider used its payload to glide downward and 
upon releasing its payload, glided upward [2]. However most 
gliders such as SLOCUM [22], Spray [23] and Seaglider [18] 
use a buoyancy engine instead. These three gliders are fixed 
winged buoyancy propelled gliders which shift their internal 
ballast mass to control their attitude [1]. 
Leonard and Graver [1] developed a laboratory scale 
ROGUE glider to implement a model based feedback open 
loop approach. Another laboratory scale glider , the ALEX 
glider, developed by Arima et al [7] designed an independently 
controllable wings and rudder. 
III. CONTROL STRATEGIES 
Several control strategies have been proposed to control the 
position, velocity and trajectory of UGs such as PID controllers 
by Bhatta and Noh [24, 25], Linear Quadratic Regulator 
(LQR)by Nina and Graver [9, 26], Sliding Mode Controllers 
(SMC) by Yang and Song [27, 28], Neural Network (NN) by 
Isa[19] and Dong[29], Fuzzy logic for self-tuning by Loc [30] 
and Model Predictive Controllers by Cooney [31] and Steenson 
[32].PID control loops used for pitch and roll control by Panish 
[16] allows their UG to be guided in a variety of ways. In such 
control strategies, vertical and horizontal modes are decoupled 
to control the pitch, angle of attack and depth of the glider. The 
robustness of PID controller using nonlinear time invariant 
aspects of glider designs is investigated by Bender [33]. AUG 
dynamics are nonlinear but PID controllers are based-on linear 
control law. Therefore, PID controller cannot dynamically 
compensate for un-modeled vehicle hydrodynamic forces and 
unknown disturbances. As such, combinations of control 
strategies to form hybrid controllers are used to handle the 
complexity that is produced due to nonlinearity and 
hydrodynamics effect. 
Sliding mode control(SMC) for underwater trajectory 
tracking control has been used by Yang and Bessa [27, 34] ; 
and Liu [21]. SMC is a robust system with low sensitivity to 
environmental disturbances. However, chattering is a well-
known downside of this control strategy, which can degrade 
the performance of gliders and may lead to instability. 
A multivariable Multiple input Multiple Output (MIMO) 
control system have been proposed for AUVs and ROVs 
including self-tuning and position control by Goheen [35]. The 
dynamic model using LQR technique was implemented in a 
laboratory scale ROGUE glider in order to examine its motion. 
However, LQR has poor switching performance between 
upward and downward glide paths [26]. 
In a comparative study, Nag [36] discussed the use of an 
adaptive fuzzy control strategy for tracking trajectory system 
combined with PID controller. However, they considered the 
glider as a SISO system only and neglected nonlinearities. A 
recurrent NN based on MPC control strategy for motion 
control problem in longitudinal plane is proposed by Shan [37] 
for convergence to optimal solution. However, in this approach 
the effect of water current has not been considered. 
Due to the inherent non-linearity in the dynamics, and hence 
difficulties in determining an accurate mathematical model of 
the vehicle, an adaptive fuzzy logic based control strategy 
coupled with dynamic compensators have been designed. The 
effect of fuzzy logic for depth controller has been implemented 
on KAUV-1 which has the advantage of fast self-tuning [30]. 
The simulation results showed satisfactory performance but 
again, the effect of external disturbance and nonlinearity were 
not investigated. The nonlinearity of the Odyssey IV for the 
purpose of disturbance rejection using Model predictive 
controller was discussed by Cooney [31] and a hybrid PIDMPC 
controller is suggested for improving and predicting 
future values. However, a communication problem between 
commanded input and actual input was observed during 
implementation of this strategy in Odyssey IV. In [27], Yang 
addressed the robustness issue produced due to nonlinearities 
and proposed the adaptive sliding mode controller. However, 
the resulting chattering effect lead to instability. 
Neural network (NN) control strategy [19] have been 
proposed as a solution to the lack of robustness due to 
nonlinear effect in dynamic models. Due to the ability to 
handle nonlinearity and adapt to changing conditions as is the 
case of varying currents in glider dynamics, NN has been 
implemented in USM hybrid underwater glider [19]. In 
proposed model, all glider parameters e.g. pitch, speed, 
maneuverability, sliding mass, wing, rudder and propeller were 
controlled. A neural network self-tuning PID controller [29] for 
a spherical AUV was proposed for the purpose of controlling 
the vehicle velocity and tracking the desired target in the 
vehicle fixed coordinate system. 
IV. HYBRID CONTROL STRATEGY 
The performance of individual control strategies can be 
improved by combining it with another control strategy to form 
a hybrid control strategy. Different implementations of this 
concept have been applied successfully in AUVs such as 
Adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control strategy. 
A. Combining fuzzy logic and sliding mode 
Fuzzy logic has been used to design a sliding mode 
controller[28, 38]. However, the FLC was implemented in a 
SISO system only. Alternatively, PID and FLC have been 
combined to design a new controller. To eliminate the 
chartering effect of sliding mode, a boundary layer is 
introduced around the sliding surface by Song [28]. A general 
block diagram of adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller is 
shown in Figure 3. 
B. Sliding mode fuzzy controller 
In this approach, sliding mode is used to design functions of 
the fuzzy logic controller and a switching function is formed 
which can eliminate the chattering effect. This type of 
approach was experimentally applied to OEX series AUVs for 
pitching and heading control. The inputs to SMFC heading 
controller were defined as heading error while the output for 
heading controller was to control the rudder.[39]. 
The control strategy can be further improved using a
combination of nonlinear controllers for the motion of
autonomous underwater gliders based on added mass and
inertia, effect of external varying disturbances and rudder
control inputs[40] . However the effectiveness of an adaptive
fuzzy sliding mode controller has only been investigated for
the Snorkel AUV [38]. Recent work concerning different
control techniques for AUVs and AUGs is summarized in
Table 2.
V. MAJOR LIMITATION AND CHALLENGES 
Very few control schemes are proposed to measure the 
sensitivity analysis of environmental disturbances such as 
Isa[12] and Fan [50], but this is a new idea in undersea 
vehicles to consider both water current estimation and 
payload factor in dynamic modelling and control for UGs. 
The main attempt is to choose a controller that can guarantee 
the suppression or at least the limitation of the overshoot in 
the system response. An appropriate control strategy is 
required that will damp out the external disturbances and will 
follow trajectory with minimum error for varying payloads. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
Different control strategies have been demonstrated for 
acceptable control performance in different AUVs and 
AUGs, but they still have limitations in compensating for the 
high nonlinearity of underwater gliders including external 
disturbances and carrying large payloads which are the main 
reasons that make it a challenging problem to control the 
underwater glider. Due to this it is highly desirable to design 
a controller that is robust and will give real time response. 
For this, combinations of two or more controllers have been 
developed by some researchers for AUVs to form a hybrid 
controller which can minimize the negative effect and will 
improve the performance.

Evidence of fluid seepage in Gronfjorden, Spitsbergen: Implications from an integrated acoustic study of seafloor morphology, marine sediments and tectonics
ABSTRACT
This study integrates high-resolution surface and sub-surface geophysical data to investigate possible fluid (gas and/or liquids) migration pathways to the seafloor in Gr?nfjorden, west Spitsbergen. Gr?nfjorden is an N-S aligned tributary fjord, located in the western part of the Isfjorden fjord system. Pockmarks were identified on the bathymetric data in the southern and northern parts of the fjord. Three types of shallow seep-related acoustic features have been identified in the marine sediments: i) enhanced reflections, ii) acoustic turbid zones, and iii) acoustic blankings. They occur beneath some of the pockmarks and circular patches of high-backscatter on the seafloor in the central part of the fjord, which are potential seep-related seafloor features. 6每8 km long NNWSSE striking ridges have been identified in the southern part of the study area. Thrust faults were interpreted on 2Dmultichannel seismic data truncating the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous successions of western Isfjorden, located north of Gr?nfjorden. A possible link has been found between these fault systems and the seafloor ridges which strike in a similar direction. Further, a normal fault has been identified within the shallow marine sediments which drapes the bedrock of the fjord. The fractured bedrock of the fjord and faults associated with the West Spitsbergen fold-and-thrust belt could possibly represent major conduits for fluid migration from deeper stratigraphy to shallow marine sediments and the seafloor.
1. INTRODUCTION
Integrated analysis (geophysical, geochemical and geotechnical) of shallow sub-surface fluids is important for risk assessment of marine geo-hazards, localizing hydrocarbon reservoirs and identification of shallow and deep source rocks (Hovland and Judd, 1988; Hovland et al., 2002; Ostanin et al., 2013). In this paper, ＆fluid＊ means both the liquid and gaseous phases, including pore-water with dissolved gas and/or dispersed gas bubbles (when the pore-water is supersaturated with gas). Fluids from deep and shallow sources can migrate along faults to the seafloor, where features like pockmarks, mud volcanoes or carbonate mounds are formed (Ligtenberg, 2005; Judd and Hovland, 2007; Sahling et al., 2008; L?seth et al., 2009; Barnard et al., 2015). The distribution of these various types of seep features on the seafloor depends on the location and geometry of underlying reservoirs, geological unconformities and seal bypass systems (faults and intrusions) which act as fluid migration pathways (Ligtenberg, 2005; Cartwright et al., 2007; Gay et al., 2007; Judd and Hovland, 2007; Chand et al., 2012; Ostanin et al., 2013).
Several studies have documented seabed fluid flow, seepage features, occurrence of gas hydrates, and associated slope failures in the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea and the West Spitsbergen continental margin (Plaza-Faverola et al., 2011; Vadakkepuliyambatta et al., 2013; Dumke et al., 2016). Gas flares in the water column of southwest and west of Spitsbergen have been reported by Damm et al. (2005) and Westbrook et al. (2009). Near-surface hydrocarbon anomalies suggest mixed biogenic and thermogenic gases in the fjords and shelf sediments of west Spitsbergen (Knies et al., 2004).
Pockmarks associated with possible shallow gas occurrences have been previously described in Isfjorden (Forwick et al., 2009; Roy et al., 2014). Gr?nfjorden is located in the western part of the main Isfjorden fjord system in Spitsbergen, where the largest pockmark has been reported (Roy et al., 2015). However, shallow gas-related acoustic anomalies and the influence of regional geology on focused fluid flow associated with the pockmarks in Gr?nfjorden have not been studied so far. The objective of this paper is to investigate the sub-surface fluid occurrences, seafloor seepage features and processes in order to better understand how they are connected to the complex deeper geological setting in Gr?nfjorden. This study uses high-resolution multibeam bathymetric and backscatter data, shallow sub-bottom acoustic data and multichannel 2D seismic data to investigate the seafloor seeps, sub-surface fluid occurrences and their link to underlying tectonic and structural features.
2. REGIONAL SETTING
Gr?nfjorden is located 9 km southeast of the mouth of the Isfjorden fjord system in west Spitsbergen (Fig. 1). The mouth of Isfjorden was deglaciated c. 12,300 calendar years BP (Mangerud et al., 1992). The glacigenic stratigraphic units blanketing the bedrock of Gr?nfjorden have been described in Fig. 4C of Forwick and Vorren (2010), comprising subglacial, glacier frontal, and glacimarine deposits. Sedimentary sources to these deposits are the valley glaciers terminating along the southern-southwestern coast of Gr?nfjorden (Fig. 2A). The river Gr?ndalselva has deposited fluvial to paralic sediments along the central- eastern coast of the fjord (Fig. 3). Restricted water exchange and high sedimentation rates have the potential to result in anoxic bottom water conditions in Arctic fjords like Gr?nfjorden (Howe et al., 2010).
The tectonic setting of Gr?nfjorden is in the frontal syncline of a major regional monocline of the WSFTB (Ohta et al., 1992; Braathen et al., 1995) (Fig. 2). This major structure shows faults, mostly low angle to bedding and some steeply dipping, likely related to thrusting. On a small scale, extensional and shear fractures have been found in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary sequences (Braathen and Bergh, 1995; Teyssier et al., 1995). A distinct NNW-SSE strike characterizes the thick-skinned basement-involved fold-thrust complex in the study area (Braathen and Bergh, 1995; Bergh et al., 1997). However, the Isfjorden-Ymerbukta fault has an NE-SW trend offsetting the fold complex dextrally (Braathen et al., 1999) (Fig. 3).
The onshore bedrock succession is dominated by the Paleocene Firkanten Formation and the Cretaceous Carolinefjellet and Helvetiafjellet formations on both sides of Gr?nfjorden. The Firkanten Formation consists of sandstone and some shale with intervening coal layers (Steel et al., 1981; Dallmann, 1999). Belowthis, the Carolinefjellet and Helvetiafjellet formations are overlying the Janusfjellet Subgroup (Ohta et al., 1992; Braathen and Bergh, 1995) (Fig. 2B). The Aptian- Albian Carolinefjellet Formation is subdivided into five members according to the predominance of shales, siltstones or sandstones, and correlates with Kolmule Formation of the Barents Shelf (Dallmann, 1999). The Helvetiafjellet Formation consists of 50每100mof largely fluvial sandstones and shales, possessing good reservoir potential in the Barents Sea (Edwards, 1979; Midtkandal et al., 2007; Gjelberg and Steel, 2012). The underlying Middle Jurassic坼Lower Cretaceous Janusfjellet Subgroup is c. 400 m thick shaly unit (Dypvik et al., 1991). The Middle Triassic每Jurassic Kapp Toscana Group (c. 475 m) and Sassendalen Group (c. 700 m) consist of sandstone intercalated with thin shale layers and thick shaly layers intercalated with sandstone and siltstones, respectively (Dallmann, 1999). The organic rich rocks in the study area are the black paper shales of the Middle Triassic Botneheia Formation andMiddle Jurassic坼Lower Cretaceous Janusfjellet Subgroup (M?rk and Bjor?y, 1984; Dypvik, 1985; Bjor?y et al., 2010) (Fig. 4).
3. DATA AND METHODS
This study uses multibeam backscatter and bathymetric data, shallow sub-bottom acoustic profiles and deep 2D multichannel seismic data. ArcGIS and Petrel software were used to interpret, integrate and correlate seafloor and sub-surface features on different geophysical data sets, ultimately offering a 3D platform for a coupled sub-surface to seafloor analysis.
3.1. Multibeam data
The high-resolution multibeam swath bathymetric data were collected with a 95 kHz Kongsberg Maritime EM1002 multibeam echo sounder by the Norwegian Hydrographic Service in 2008 (Figs. 2A and 3). In addition to this, multibeam backscatter data were collected using a Kongsberg Maritime EM300 multibeam echo sounder operating at a frequency of 30 kHz, onboard RV Helmer Hanssen in 2010 (Fig. 3). CTD measurements were done at the mouth and center of the fjord in order to calculate the velocity profile (1464每1472 m/s) in thewater column. References to ※backscatter§ throughout the paper should be regarded as relative backscatter strength. The processed backscatter and bathymetric data were gridded with 0.6 m and 5 m horizontal cell size respectively using IVS 3D Fledermaus v.7.0 software.
3.2. Sub-bottom acoustic data
The shallow high-resolution seismic data were acquired with a 4kW EM3300 hull-mounted sub-bottom profiler on the RV Helmer Hanssen in 2010 (Fig. 1). This instrument uses a frequency range of 2每16 kHz that allows a vertical resolution of 6每10 cm. The sub-bottom acoustic profiles could image the marine sediment layers to a maximum depth of c. 20每25 m below the fjord seafloor. Edgetech Discoverer II software was used for visual interpretation of stratigraphic units and acoustic anomalies related to possible shallow gas occurrences.
3.3. 2D multichannel seismic data 
The conventional 2D multichannel marine seismic data were acquired in Isfjorden by Statoil in 1985 and 1988 using 2400 and 3000 m long streamers, respectively, and 25 m between shot-points (Fig. 1). Acquisition and processing parameters of the 2D seismic surveys (ST8515 and ST8815) are provided in B?lum and Braathen (2012) and Blinova et al. (2012). Due to the large variations in 2D data quality in the western part of Isfjorden, interpretation of the seismic data is problematic. The poor reflectivity (diffuse nature), continuity and undulating nature of the reflections has been attributed to the hard sea floor combined with high velocity rocks and complex structural setting of the WSFTB in this area (Braathen et al., 1995; Bergh et al., 1997; B?lum and Braathen, 2012; Blinova et al., 2013) (Fig. 4B). Acoustic penetration is c. 3每4 s TWT (two-way-travel time), which is equivalent to c. 7每9 km depth (using Vp values provided in B?lum and Braathen (2012)). The structural interpretation of the seismic data was donewith Petrel software.
4. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION
4.1. Bathymetric data: seafloor morphology and evidence of seepage
4.1.1. Observations
The seafloor of Gr?nfjorden is relatively smooth, as compared to some of the other tributary fjords of the Isfjorden fjord system (Ottesen and Dowdeswell, 2006; Baeten et al., 2010; Roy et al., 2015). The water depth varies from 15 m at the head to 190 m at the mouth of the fjord. The central part is occupied by a 1.7 km wide and 6.6 km long basin with a maximum water depth of 150 m (Fig. 2A). The northern part of the fjord is characterized by a 5.8 km2 plateau, with a relief of 16每20m(Fig. 2A). A 1.5 km long transverse ridge with a relief of 2每12m (from E toW) is located 100m south of this plateau. The southern part of the fjord is characterized by 6每8 km long, parallel to sub-parallel ridges with a relief of 2每60 m, and oriented along NNW-SSE direction (Fig. 2A).
19 circular depressions (100每240 m diameter and 6每10 m deep) have been observed in the northern part of the fjord. The circular depressions do not have raised rims, but their edges are sharply defined. Their slope changes from horizontal to an estimated 20每30∼ within a distance of 0.5每1 m. Some of these have been previously described by Forwick et al. (2009) and Roy et al. (2015). Smaller circular depressions (20每60mdiameter and b3mdeep) have been observed in the southern part of the fjord (Fig. 3). There are no circular depressions in the central basin.
4.1.2. Interpretation
Fluid escape from the seafloor lifts the fine sediments into suspension, and then the suspended fine sediments get redistributed by near-bottom currents, resulting in the formation of circular depressions in the seafloor. These circular depressions are termed as pockmarks (King and MacLean, 1970),which provide evidence of fluid escape. Subglacial landforms are not well preserved in the present day seafloor of Gr?nfjorden, presumably due to the thick postglacial sediment cover in the fjord originating from the glaciers and rivers draining into the fjord (Forwick and Vorren, 2010). Geological maps and cross-sections from the northern part of the fjord show slivers of Paleocene bedrock on either sides of the fjord and a distinct syncline-anticline pair (Ohta et al., 1992; Braathen and Bergh, 1995) (Fig. 2A). The fold in the Paleocene succession coincides with the extent of the plateau on the fjord seafloor, suggesting that Paleocene rocks probably make up the bedrock of the plateau. The E-W striking transverse ridge located 100msouth of the plateau has been interpreted as a thrust moraine based on its orientation perpendicular to ice-flow direction and acoustic facies analysis (Forwick and Vorren, 2010) (Fig. 2A). The sub-parallel ridges oriented NNW-SSE in the southern part of the fjord coincide with the alignment of the steeply dipping Upper Jurassic坼Lower Cretaceous successions and thrust faults observed in the northern part of the study area and adjacent onshore bedrocks (Ohta et al., 1992; Braathen et al., 1995; Bergh et al., 1997; Blinova et al., 2012) (Figs. 2 and 3). Hence, it is suggested that these ridges probably relate to steeply dipping competent Late Mesozoic layers and/or thrust faults of the WSFTB.
4.2. Seafloor backscatter data: anomalies related to possible seepage
4.2.1. Observations
The seafloor acoustic backscatter data in Gr?nfjorden has values ranging from ?6.38 to ?54.88 dB (Fig. 3). In general, the western part of the fjord has higher backscatter values compared to the eastern part. But in particular, high backscatter values are observed in the center of deep pockmark depressions in the northern part (Fig. 5B and C). In addition, 16 circular patches (40每70 m diameter) of relatively high backscatter values (?19 to ?23 dB with a background value of c. ?30 dB) are observed in the central basin, which are devoid of pockmark depressions (Figs. 3, 6B and C).
4.2.2. Interpretation 
Acoustic backscatter intensity is a function of sea bottom character (mostly roughness and sediment type) (Borgeld et al., 1999; Urgeles et al., 2002; Collier and Brown, 2005). Variable grain size distribution, porosity, presence of gas, and bioturbation can influence the seafloor roughness and backscatter character resulting in anomalous backscatter values. For example, Hovland (1990) found higher acoustic reflectivity of the seafloor sediments where gas was present immediately below the seafloor.
The localized high-backscatter values observed in the center of the pockmark depressions in Gr?nfjorden (Fig. 5B and C), are interpreted to be caused by coarse sediments, which are expected to be present inside the pockmarks due to winnowing of fine grained sediments. High reflectivity from authigenic mineral precipitates associated with fluid seepage could also be a possible reason for such results, as observed in other settings (Judd and Hovland, 2007; Naudts et al., 2008; Dandapath et al., 2010).
It is suspected that the circular patches (pockmark-like) of high-backscatter in the central basin could possibly relate to precipitates following diffuse fluid seepage from the seafloor (Fig. 6B). Similar high-backscatter anomalies have been attributed to authigenic carbonates which are formed due to oxidation of seeping methane in other offshore settings (Orange et al., 2002; Sahling et al., 2008; Ivanov et al., 2010). However, bioturbation induced roughness could also have an influence on the backscatter strength at these suspected seep locations. Surface sampling, coring, and geochemical analysis are required to confirm the actual cause of these acoustic anomalies.
4.3. Sub-bottom acoustic data: anomalies related to shallow gas
4.3.1. Description and interpretation of seismic units
Five seismo-stratigraphic units (A1每A5) are distinguished based on the variation of acoustic signatures, bounded by coherent seismic reflections (Table 1). The units are bounded at the base and top by continuous, parallel to sub-parallel, medium-high amplitude seismic reflections (Fig. 7). However, unit geometries and bedding style varies from head to mouth of the fjord. Acoustic penetration is limited over steeply dipping bedrock ridges, resulting in reduced reflection strength and chaotic zones instead of distinct seismic reflectors (Fig. 6A). The acoustic basement is characterized by a medium to high amplitude, partly diffuse reflection, 15每20 m below the seafloor (Fig. 7). It can generally be distinguished over the entire study area and is interpreted as the top of the bedrock.
Closely spaced conformal internal reflectors have been identified in units A3, A4 and A5 (Figs. 6A and 7). It is suggested that these internal reflectors could result from the lithological variations of well stratified deposits originating from the river Gr?ndalselva. A steeply dipping (c. 70∼ dip angle), E-NE striking normal fault has been interpreted, with 4每5 m offset which displaces units A1, A2 and A3 (Fig. 7). Furthermore, three types of acoustic anomalies attributed to possible shallow gas migration/ accumulation, are discussed below.
4.3.2. Acoustic blankings 
4.3.2.1. Observations. Vertical acoustic blankings appear as patches distorting the continuity of seismic reflectors bounding the seismo-stratigraphic units. Acoustic blankings (C1 and C2) distort the continuity of a high-amplitude continuous seismic reflection in between units A4 and A5 (Figs. 6Aand8D). C1 and C2 are 5每10mwide. Several vertical acoustic blanking features (1每4 m high, 15每20 m wide) distort unit A2 in the northern part of the profile (Figs. 7 and 8B). Occasionally, they are associated with up-doming of the reflector above them. Further along the southern slope of the profile, thinner (b10 m wide) acoustic blanking features have been identified. The vertical acoustic blankings within unit A2 are widespread in the eastern part of the fjord and gradually disappear in the western part.
4.3.2.2. Interpretation. Acoustic blankings usually occur in marine sediments due to disruption of sediment layering by the migration of gas, or by the absorption of acoustic energy in overlying gas charged sediments. In the thick units of unconsolidated glacimarine sediments in Gr?nfjorden, it is suspected that these acoustic features are most likely caused by the scattering and attenuation of acoustic energy by upward migrating gas or by the presence of gas-charged sediments in units A1每A2 and A4每A5. The up-doming reflector suggests possible sediment mobilization or dewatering above some of the acoustic blanking features. The combined presence of circular patches (pockmark-like) of high-backscatter values at the seafloor and the underlying acoustic blankings supports this scenario of near-seabed fluid flow.
4.3.3. Enhanced reflections 
4.3.3.1. Observations. Coherent seismic reflections with high-amplitude and abrupt terminations have been observed at several stratigraphic levels within the marine sediments (Table 1, Figs. 6A, 7 and 8A). They occur commonly beneath the circular patches of high-backscatter (pockmark-like) and in association with acoustic blankings. A seismic reflection characterized by high-continuity and high-amplitude bounding A4 and A5 units is diffuse beneath a high-amplitude seismic reflection (marked by red line in Fig. 6A).
4.3.3.2. Interpretation. High amplitude reflections are termed as ＆enhanced reflections＊ by Judd and Hovland (1992) in the shallow marine sediments of North Sea. They usually occur due to gas saturation within porous marine sediments. The presence of free gas in the sediment pore space causes a reduction of P-wave velocity and high impedance contrast, giving rise to a reflection with anomalously high amplitude from the top of the gas (Judd and Hovland, 1992; Schroot et al., 2005). Hence, it is suspected that the high-amplitude enhanced reflections observed in Gr?nfjorden are most likely caused by the strong decrease in acoustic impedance at the top of gas-charged sediments (Figs. 6A and 7). Alternatively, the enhanced reflections within unit A5 just beneath the seafloor could also result from stratified layer of course grained sediments brought in by the river Gr?ndalselva (Fig. 7).
4.3.4. Acoustic turbid zones 
4.3.4.1. Observation. Chaotic reflections resembling dark vertical smear are observed on the acoustic data within unit A5 (Table 1). These vertical acoustic turbid zones occasionally extend 2每5 m vertically below pockmark depressions (Fig. 8C). The upper limit of these features is irregular, diffuse and without a clear boundary, but occasionally is marked by blurred high-amplitude reflections.
4.3.4.2. Interpretation. Acoustic turbidity is interpreted to result from scattering of the acoustic energy by interstitial gas bubbles trapped in the sediment pores (Schubel, 1974). It is suspected, that these zones of acoustic turbidity in Gr?nfjorden are possibly ascribed to irregularly distributed, gas-charged sediments (of low-acoustic velocity) below the pockmark depressions. The top of the turbid zone cannot be clearly resolved possibly due to minor gas seepage from the pockmarks. Alternatively, these features could be a result of ※acoustic focusing§ effect below the pockmark depressions.
4.4. 2D multichannel seismic data: fold-and-thrust belt related structures 
4.4.1. Observations 
Four seismic reflectionswithmedium-high amplitudes and low-medium continuity are identified up to a depth of 1.4 s (TWT) in the 2D seismic profiles (Table 2, Fig. 4B).Majority of these reflections are related to the impedance contrasts between shale sections and thicker sandstone layers. These reflections are tied to the geological unit boundaries in Spitsbergen, as published by Ohta et al. (1992), Braathen et al. (1995), Bergh et al. (1997) and Blinova et al. (2013). The reflectivity patterns of the seismic units and their suggested linkwith the regional stratigraphy are shown in Table 2.
4.4.2. Interpretation Shallower sections (b0.6 s) show high-amplitude continuous reflections due to sharp acoustic impedance contrast between the Janusfjellet Formation shales and the overlying Helvetiafjellet Formation sandstones. Based on observed offset between reflections, thrust faults have been interpreted in the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous successions. This has been done by identifying consistent dip-domains that point to long thrust ramps (Fig. 4B). Two d谷collement (detachment) layers have been identified as surfaces to which the thrust faults are rooted. Blinova et al. (2013) and Roy et al. (2014) have illustrated three d谷collement layers on other seismic profiles in central Isfjorden area. The d谷collement layer within the deeper Gipshuken Formation (Carboniferous) cannot be identified in this seismic profile due to the complex deformation in the western Isfjorden area (Braathen et al., 1995). The thrust faults cannot be mapped further south into Gr?nfjorden due to the lack of 2D seismic data coverage. However, sub-parallel ridges mapped on the bathymetric data aligned along the strike direction of the bedding and thrust faults mark the possible continuation of the subsurface geology within the Mesozoic rocks, sub-cropping below the seafloor of Gr?nfjorden (Figs. 2A and 3).
5. Discussion
5.1. Characterization of shallow gas in marine sediments
Three types of acoustic anomalies attributed to suspected shallow gas occurrences have been identified in the marine sediments of Gr?nfjorden: (i) enhanced reflections, (ii) acoustic turbid zones, and (iii) acoustic blankings. Quantification of shallow gas based on these acoustic anomalies is difficult. Laboratory studies on sediment acoustic properties have indicated that the presence of low concentration (0.5每 1%) of discrete gas voids within fine grained shallow marine sediments could cause zones of acoustic turbidity, whereas higher concentration interconnected gas-filled pore spaces result in enhanced reflections (Schubel, 1974; Hovland and Judd, 1988; Wilkens and Richardson, 1998). The abundance of the latter in Gr?nfjorden could possibly suggest a relatively higher concentration of gas in the topmost 10mof sediments. The physical property logs in the top 10 m of the glacimarine sediments of Isfjorden show up-core decrease in bulk density and increase in fractional porosity (42每83%) (Forwick and Vorren, 2009). Hence in this study, it is suspected that gas can preferentially accumulate within the moderate-high porous, relatively uniform, fine grained topmost 10 m of the glacimarine Holocene sediments and cause the acoustic turbid zones and enhanced reflections.
Deeper in the stratigraphy, vertical acoustic blanking zones distort continuous reflections bounding units A1, A2 and A5; suggesting possible upward gas migration or mobilized sediments (Figs. 6A, 7 and 8B). Similar suggestions have been made by Schroot et al. (2005) and L?seth et al. (2009) in an attempt to describe acoustic gas features above hydrocarbon reserves. The subglacial deposits and glacier frontal deposits of units A1 and A2 consist a mixture of silt, clay, sand, gravel and boulders (Forwick and Vorren, 2010). Different stages of loading (during glacier advance) and unloading (during glacier retreat) could have resulted in the formation of fractures (Forwick and Vorren, 2009). The effective anisotropy caused by the fracture systemcan create fluctuations in the P-wave velocity, resulting in acoustic blanking features (Arntsen et al., 2007). Hence, the presence of fractures could also lead to scattering and attenuation of the seismic waves in addition to the scattering caused by the presence of gas in the pore spaces of sediments.
5.2. Seafloor backscatter anomalies 
Major sediment input from glacially fed rivers, along its south-eastern coast, and fjord water circulation (Coriolis force driven currents), possibly contribute to the differences in bottom sediment distribution 每 resulting in variable backscatter strength between the eastern and western parts of Gr?nfjorden.
The abundant presence of fine-grained, muddy sediments and the high sedimentation rates from the rivers and glaciers could have resulted in the fast burial of the organic matter (Elverh?i et al., 1983; Forwick and Vorren, 2009). Additionally, the anoxic bottom waters in the Arctic fjords (Howe et al., 2010), provide ideal conditions for the generation of biogenic gas in the marine sediments. Under such a scenario, methane derived authigenic carbonates could form within pockmarks, by anaerobic oxidation of methane, which might result in high-backscatter anomalies.
Medium-high intensity bioturbation is found in the topmost 450 cm glacimarine sediments of Isfjorden (Forwick and Vorren, 2009). Pertaining to the high percentage of clayey silts and occurrence of bioturbation in Isfjorden (Forwick and Vorren, 2009), volume scattering caused by bioturbation might be considered an alternative probable cause for these high-backscatter anomalies. Hence, it is suggested that the circular patches of high-backscatter on the seafloor and high-backscatter from the center of pockmark depressions are most likely caused either by bioturbation, coarse lag deposits, or mineral precipitates following fluid seepage. The reason why the circular patches of high-backscatter are lacking a morphological expression is most probably, the annual supply of fluvial sediments into the central part of the fjord from the river Gr?ndalselva, located on the eastern shore of the fjord (Fig. 3). This river is active every summer and autumn, thus, most probably obliterating the depressions and smoothing the central part of the fjord seafloor with fluvial deposits.
5.3. Significance of fault conduits in fluid migration 
More than 1000 mesoscale faults were mapped in the onshore Cretaceous每 Paleocene rocks of the study area, which comprise the bedrock of Gr?nfjorden (Teyssier et al., 1995). The steeply dipping normal fault offsetting units A1, A2 and A3 has a strike direction almost orthogonal to the trend of the WSFTB (Braathen et al., 1995; Bergh et al., 1997) (Fig. 7). Similar striking faults are found in the vicinity of Gr?nfjorden, within the onshore Helvetiafjellet Formation rocks (Braathen et al., 1995; Teyssier et al., 1995). Hence, it is suggested that this relatively young normal fault was reactivated in recent times as an extensional fracture following the intercontinental compression between Svalbard and Greenland during the Late Cretaceous每Early Paleocene (Braathen and Bergh, 1995).
Ligtenberg (2005) has described the importance of sub-seismic faults associated with a major fault zone in directing vertical fluid flow from deeper source rocks, leading to the formation of pockmarks. Role of fault zones and d谷collement layers as conduits for channelled fluid flowdue to permeability anisotropy and contrasting deformation mechanisms has been documented by Tobin et al. (2001). N-E striking strikeslip faults, N-NWstriking normal and reverse faults exist in theMesozoic and Cenozoic strata of study area (Braathen and Bergh, 1995; Braathen et al., 1995; Teyssier et al., 1995). Furthermore, two d谷collement layers (D1 and D2) show splay thrusts cutting up into the overlying succession (Fig. 4B). A localized fracture frequency peak associated with low-angle thrust in the Carolinefjellet Formation has been found in drilled cores along the southwestern coast of Isfjorden (Braathen et al., 2012). Sub-seismic fractures and faults with an offset b40每50 m will not be resolved in the 2D seismic dataset used in this study. However, presence of these sub-seismic faults and fractures evidenced in drill cores and onshore bedrocks near the thrust faults may be considered as locations of concentrated fluid flow. Hence it is suspected that lateral and vertical migration of fluids along various types of faults and natural fractures could have led to the formation of pockmarks and shallow gas occurrences in Gr?nfjorden.
5.4. Suspected origins of fluids 
Sources to possible shallow gas occurrences and seafloor seepage could either be within the shallow glacigenic marine sediments (biogenic origin) or deeper organic rich rocks (thermogenic origin). Pore-water escape from the glacimarine deposits could also lead to the formation of pockmarks in Gr?nfjorden, as found in the North Sea (Harrington, 1985). However, mixture of biogenic and thermogenic signatures from near surface marine sediments have been documented in Isfjorden (Knies et al., 2004). The presence of vertical acoustic blanking zones (suggesting possible gas migration) above the fractured and faulted bedrock prompt us to investigate probable deeper thermogenic fluids originating from beneath of the glacimarine sediments. A possible source for fluids escaping through the pockmarks in northern Gr?nfjorden could be the buried coal seams of the Firkanten and Helvetiafjellet formations (Ohta et al., 1992; Dallmann, 1999). Decrease in pressure within the coal seams, following post-glacial rebound could lead to methane desorption fromthe in-situ coal deposits and release of free methane from the pore matrix of coal (Scott, 2002). However, the possibility of fluids originating from deeper strata cannot be completely ruled out due to the presence of thrust faults and organic rich Mesozoic rocks. The Middle Triassic Botneheia Formation and the Janusfjellet Subgroup in Spitsbergen consist of type II and III kerogens with high production index for hydrocarbons and high total organic contents (Bjor?y and Vigran, 1980; M?rk and Bjor?y, 1984; Bjor?y et al., 2010). Hence, these stratigraphic layers could be possible thermogenic sources to the seeping fluids in Gr?nfjorden. However, it will be necessary to obtain geochemical analysis of pore water and near surface sediments directly from seep locations to achieve a clear understanding of the composition and source of fluids.
6. Conclusions 
The evidences presented herein suggest ongoing- and/or paleo-seepage of fluids (gas and/or liquids) through the seafloor of the Gr?nfjorden, along its whole length. This conclusion is reached by the documented occurrence of pockmark depressions both in the northern and southern parts of the fjord. In the north, these pockmarks have high-backscatter values at their centers. These high-backscatter anomalies are suspected to be either caused by bioturbation, by coarse lag deposits, or by mineral precipitates following fluid seepage.
In the mid-section of the fjord there are no pockmark depressions, but only circular patches with high-backscatter. The reason why these suspected fluid flow features are lacking morphological expressions, could be the annual supply of fluvial sediments from the river which obliterates the depressions and smoothens the central part of the fjord seafloor.
Geophysical evidences of gas migration overlying the faulted and fractured bedrock along with the presence of possible hydrocarbon source rocks have allowed us to develop a conceptual model to explain the fluid flow features observed in Gr?nfjorden (Fig. 9). It can be summarized as follows:
Migrating fluids (gas and/or liquids) of unknown source and composition are suspected to be generated in the sedimentary column beneath the fjord. These fluids migrate upwards through the sedimentary strata, via faults and fractures, including thrust faults. Focused upward migration of fluids above the fjord bedrock results in acoustic blankings, which are also known as acoustic gas/seismic chimneys. Further up in the marine sediments, the fluids form either enhanced reflections, where minute gas bubbles are trapped in porous layers, or they form acoustic turbidity zones where the fluids migrate diffusively through the near-surface sediments. Finally, the fluids escape through the seafloor in a focused manner through pockmark depressions (northern and southern parts of the fjord) and pockmark-like circular patches of high backscatter (central part of the fjord).

Geomorphometric Characterization of Pockmarks by Using a GIS-Based Semi-Automated Toolbox
ABSTRACT 
Pockmarks are seabed depressions developed by fluid flow processes that can be found in vast numbers in many marine and lacustrine environments. Manual mapping of these features based on geophysical data is, however, extremely time-consuming and subjective. Here, we present results from a semi-automated mapping toolbox developed to allow more efficient and objective mapping of pockmarks. This ArcGIS-based toolbox recognizes, spatially delineates, and morphometrically describes pockmarks. Since it was first developed, the toolbox has helped to map and characterize several thousands of pockmarks on the UK continental shelf, especially within the central North Sea. This paper presents the latest developments in the functionality of the toolbox and its adaptability for application to other geographic areas (Barents Sea, Norway, and Malin Deep, Ireland) with varied pockmark and seabed morphologies, and in different geological settings. The morphometric characterization of vast numbers of pockmarks allows an unprecedented statistical analysis of their morphology. The outputs from the toolbox provide an objective, quantitative baseline for combining this information with the geological and oceanographical knowledge of individual areas, which can provide further insights into the processes responsible for their development and their influence on local seabed conditions and habitats.

1. Introduction 
First reported by offshore Nova Scotia [1], pockmarks are depressions formed in soft sediments at the seabed by fluid flow processes. Since then, the known occurrences of pockmarks have increased dramatically. The rise of the documented occurrences of pockmarks is largely thanks to technical improvements in marine geophysical survey equipment, particularly of multibeam echo-sounders (MBES), along with a more widespread use of such data for seabed mapping. Pockmarks have been found worldwide, from water depths of less than 10 m in estuaries (e.g., [2]) to over 3000 m in offshore canyons (e.g., [3]). However, the distribution of known pockmarks is currently still geographically biased, with more occurrences reported in economically developed areas of the world where high-resolution geophysical surveys have been undertaken.
Although the first accounts described these features as concave crater-like depressions [1,4], the complexity and diversity of morphologies possible have gradually become evident. Pockmarks have sizes recorded across four magnitudes, although most are between 10 and 200 m diameter and 1每25 m deep [5]. They can occur in both random and non-random distributions controlled by the underlying geology due to, for example, the presence of faults (e.g., [6]) or buried channels (e.g., [7]). The variability of size, spatial distribution, and geometry results from their development depending on a variety of parameters such as fluid type, flow fluxes, thickness and nature of near bottom sediments, underlying structure, and lithology.
Most of the initial descriptions of these features were based on low penetration seismic profiles (mainly Boomer system) and/or from sidescan sonar data (e.g., [1,4,8]). Presently, pockmarks are predominantly mapped manually using seabed digital terrain models (DTM) created from MBES data (e.g., [6]), generally a time-consuming task. In addition, delineating their individual boundaries is subjective and consistency of criterion is hard to achieve. To address this, the British Geological Survey (BGS) developed a semi-automated mapping toolbox. This ArcGIS-based BGS Seabed Mapping Toolbox recognizes, spatially delineates, and morphometrically describes seabed features including pockmarks [9], coral mounds [10], and other confined features. The toolbox is embedded in ESRI? ArcGIS, a geographic information system (GIS) widely used in the field of marine geology, allowing users to work in a familiar and integrated mapping environment. Furthermore, the scripts developed use standard ESRI? algorithms that increase the clarity of the steps taken during delineation and characterization processes. With this approach, human interaction and expert knowledge is still part of the mapping process but is limited to restricting criteria for feature mapping. This allows multiple mapping exercises to be performed with the same criterion, improving comparisons across different areas or quantification of seabed changes over time. The tools also allow an extensive morphological characterization of the mapped features with a fraction of the effort that would be required using manual techniques.
The consistent characterization of vast numbers of pockmarks with multiple morphological characteristics allows an unprecedented statistical analysis of their morphology. Combining this statistical analysis with the geological and oceanographic knowledge of individual areas provides insights into the processes responsible for their development and the influence of local seabed conditions. The application of this method to different datasets, over a wider range of water depths, seabed sediments types, and geological settings, as reported in this study, significantly increases the understanding of the formation, evolution, and preservation of these common, but still poorly understood, seabed features.
This work is the result of a semi-formal collaboration, established in 2015, between national seabed mapping programmes in Norway (MAREANO, www.mareano.no), Ireland (INFOMAR, www. infomar.ie), and the UK (MAREMAP, www.maremap.ac.uk). This collaboration has facilitated the exchange of data and methods for the development of various aspects of geological mapping of the seafloor. Mapping of pockmarks was quickly identified as an objective of common interest to the geological surveys within the three mapping programmes, and one for which quantitative, objective methods were not yet readily available. Testing this mapping approach originally developed for UK seabed data in other geological settings data from the Barents Sea (Norway) and Malin Basin (Ireland) will lead to further developments of the toolbox. In this paper, we explore the applicability of this practical and effective mapping approach, fully integrated within the most used GIS software, and illustrate the potential of the use of morphometric parameters to characterize pockmarks.
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1. Study Areas and Datasets
A total of 20 MBES datasets were used in this study. These comprise: (1) 18 site survey datasets from the North Sea (UK) held by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and forming part of the MAREMAP data repository; (2) a dataset from the Malin Basin (Ireland) acquired by INFOMAR; and (3) a dataset from the Barents Sea (Norway) acquired by the MAREANO programme (Figure 1).
The selected datasets represent not just a diversity of geological settings, but also a range of data resolutions and quality, and present different mapping challenges. A resolution range from 1 to 10 m and pockmarks from 20 m to almost 800 m wide provided an opportunity to assess the impact of cell size and feature size in the mapping results. The dataset from Malin Deep provided a chance to test the impact of both regional topography and the presence of MBES acquisition artefacts on the delineation and characterization of pockmarks. The Barents Sea example, where pockmarks are particularly prolific, allowed us to explore the of the tools where vast numbers of seabed features are present.
2.1.1. Witch Ground Basin每North Sea (UK)
In the northern part of the North Sea, especially across the Witch Ground Basin, pockmarks can be found in high numbers (Figure 2). The Witch Ground Basin is an extensive area of muds reaching water depths greater than 150 m. It was a depo-centre for fine-grained sedimentation at the end of the Weichselian glaciation, when sediments were deposited very rapidly, creating a thick sequence of very soft muds [11]. Seismic profiles often show acoustic blanking within the shallow section of the Quaternary sequence underlying the Witch Ground Formation, which suggests that shallow gas is trapped at selected horizons [12]; such accumulations support the hypothesis that the pockmarks found in this basin were formed by gas escape at irregular intervals since deglaciation [13]. In addition, since the seabed in the Witch Ground Basin has remained essentially unchanged by erosion or sedimentation once the sea level stabilized after the last glaciation, the pockmarks represent the cumulative effects of gas-escape activity over a period of at least 8000 years [14].
The vast majority of the pockmarks mapped within the Witch Ground Basin are less than 3 m deep [9], with an area of approximately 2000 to 4000 m2. In cross-section, these pockmarks are mainly V-shaped (Figure 2d), with a few of them being U-shaped and very rarely W-shaped with a degree of asymmetry, whereas in plan-view, they are generally circular to elongate. Besides the vast number of unit pockmarks, several unusually large pockmarks were found in the Witch Ground Basin area. The largest of them, and among the largest pockmarks known globally, is the western pockmark of the Scanner Pockmark Complex (Figure 2a,b) [15].
The BGS has gathered numerous MBES datasets over the last decades in UK territorial waters, especially from the North Sea. These include the 18 multibeam datasets used by [9] in their first study http://using the semi-automatic mapping approach (Figure 2). These datasets were collected for the Strategic Environment Assessment programme (SEA programme) and data were collected as part of site surveys for exploration wells commissioned by different operators. Due to the purpose for which the data were acquired, these datasets tend to be of high resolution (of 2 m for most) but cover small areas, ranging from less than 5 km2 up to 36 km2. In total, the 18 datasets cover an area of 306 km2.
2.1.2. Malin Basin (Ireland) 
The Malin Shelf lies immediately north of Ireland and west of Scotland, with typical depths between 100 and 150 m. Seabed morphology is rocky and irregular in the east, while to the west, it is relatively sandy and smooth. The Malin shelf shallow geology is characterized by glacial diamictons, muds, and sands [16]. The Malin Deep pockmark field lies in the outer Malin shelf, approximately 70 km offshore northwest of the Malin Head. The area covers approximately1000km2. The pockmark field lies in a basin characterized by a smooth and soft seabed composed of fine-grained marine sediments, ranging from fine sands to silts. The thickness of the Quaternary deposits varies N-S from 175 to 125 m [17]. Both acoustic and electromagnetic evidence indicates the presence of fluids within these deposits [18]. Geochemical analysis of sulphate profiles indicates that gas from the shallow reservoir has been migrating upwards [18].
The Malin Deep dataset covers an area of c. 865 km2 (Figure 3). The Geological Survey of Ireland and the Marine Institute acquired this dataset in 2003, as part of the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS), the precursor to the INFOMAR mapping programme. Data were acquired on-board the R.V. Celtic Explorer using a Kongsberg-Simrad EM1002 multibeam echosounder, with an operational frequency of 93每98 kHz. Bathymetric data cleaning was performed on-board and statistical analysis of the data indicates a vertical accuracy of <40 cm across the region. Resulting bathymetric terrain models were gridded at 5 m - 5 m.
2.1.3. Barents Sea (Norway) 
Pockmarks are a frequent occurrence in the Barents Sea, occurring far beyond the area investigated in this study. The distribution and likely origins of the pockmarks in the SW Barents Sea and Finnmark fjords, northern Norway, have been recently documented as part of a broad-scale study by [19], where the study area investigated here falls under their description for the ※Easternmost Norwegian sector§. The study area considered here was classified by [19] as having a high density (300每800 per km2) of pockmarks; however, the individual pockmarks were not delineated in that study. The authors showed that in the Barents Sea, pockmarks occur in areas where soft glaciomarine and marine sediments were deposited after the ice margin retreated [19]. The distribution of pockmarks thereby reflects the distribution of soft, fine-grained postglacial deposits in the SW Barents Sea. They also conclude that the pockmarks formed due to the melting of gas hydrates. It is suggested that this process probably started c. 14,500 cal. years ago, after the ice cap had melted and the bottom water temperature and thus the seabed temperature had increased due to the inflow of warm Atlantic water.
The Barents Sea dataset provided by MAREANO covers an area of 100 km2 near the Norway-Russian border (Figure 4). The data were collected by MMT under contract to the Norwegian Hydrographic Service as part of the MAREANO seabed mapping programme in 2011 using a Kongsberg EM710 MBES on the survey vessel M/V Franklin. Data are gridded at a 5 m resolution, a standard output for MAREANO bathymetric mapping. The data are of good quality and do not exhibit any significant artefacts from data acquisition or processing.
2.2. Manual Mapping 
Marine geological mapping methods have evolved substantially over recent decades, alongside diversification in the uses for this mapping. However, manual mapping of seabed features still represents a huge component of the effort to map and understand the seabed. Almost invariably, manual mapping of seabed features will involve the use of a GIS. It allows the creation, visualization, and analysis of DTMs, hillshade (from one or more directions), and several other rasters derived from the bathymetry data (e.g., slope, aspect, and curvature). GIS also provides a convenient platform for manual, expert-driven digitization of seabed features, based on the analysis of multiple layers of information. The definition of the limits of the geomorphic features is based on expert judgement complemented with classification schemes, but is often subjective. 
The example of manual mapping of pockmarks included in this study is based on the 5 m DTM and slope maps derived from the Malin Basin dataset. Seabed depressions shallower than 0.5 m were dismissed, as this approaches the vertical accuracy of the data (c. 40 cm). This area is particularly challenging due to the artefacts present in the dataset.
2.3. Pixel-Based Calculation of Terrain Attributes as a Basis for Semi-Automated Mapping 
Pixel-based analyses of bathymetric DTMs are often used to produce derived terrain attributes that serve as an aid to the manual digitization of features (as in the Malin Deep region). However, these derived terrain attributes can also be used for automatic pixel-based mapping, based on expert-defined threshold values before manual fine-tuning. 
Here, we explore some terrain attributes, derived from pixel-based analyses, related to slope, curvature, and relative position in order to examine their potential for delineating pockmarks. Other terrain attributes relating to orientation and terrain variability may be useful for describing the nature of the pockmarks but are not so directly relevant to their delineation.
The pixel-based terrain analysis methods presented as part of this study were conducted on SEA2 Box4 of the Witch Ground Basin datasets. This area is particularly challenging due to the different shapes and sizes of the pockmarks. Therefore, it is a good example for examining how well various methods are able to delineate the pockmarks. The methods and analysis scales used (Table 1) were http://selected to provide examples of the various approaches rather than conducting an exhaustive analysis of the area. A selection of the results is presented in Section 3.1, where results from the BGS Seabed Mapping Toolbox are shown for comparison.
2.4. BGS Seabed Mapping Toolbox 
The BGS-developed tools in the BGS Seabed Mapping Toolbox run individual Python scripts that use a sequence of pre-existing ArcGIS geoprocessing tools. The toolbox includes (1) data preparation tools; (2) feature delineation tools; and (3) characterization tools.
2.4.1. Data Preparation 
The basic input to the BGS Seabed Mapping Toolbox is a DTM, either obtained from a multibeam echosounder dataset or from another dataset that can be used to generate a DTM of the seabed or buried surface (e.g., 3D seismic〞[25]). In datasets strongly affected by artefacts, when using the semi-automated mapping toolbox, pockmarks may be incorrectly delineated and spurious values may be captured during their characterization. This was the case for the dataset available for the Malin Basin, where acquisition artefacts markedly affect this dataset (Figure 5). Artificial vertical reliefs (corrugations) of up to 50 cm are detected systematically across the dataset due to tidal shifts in the lines overlap and vessel motion-related artefacts across the swath. These are comparable in magnitude to the vertical relief of some of the pockmarks. For that reason, it was necessary to smooth the initial bathymetric surface. The ArcGIS Focal Statistics tool was used to smooth the original surface. The smoothed surface was then used as the input surface for both the pockmark delineation and characterization tools. The Focal Statistics tool performs a neighbourhood operation that computes an output raster where the value for each output cell is a function of the values of all the input cells that are in a specified neighbourhood around that location.
The overall regional morphology and the presence of overlapping morphological features can also affect the ability of the delineation tools to correctly map pockmarks. This can be addressed by using the BGS-developed Filter-based Clip Tool. This tool automatically identifies and clips areas of special interest where seabed features are likely to be present. The use of this tool is particularly useful in a setting like the Malin Basin (Figure 6), where the pockmarks occur within a regional basin. During the first delineation, the entire small basin was erroneously mapped as a pockmark since it is also a confined depression (Figure 6A). The Filter-based Clip Tool identifies and outlines areas of vertical relief changes, which are then used to clip the original DTM excluding the data from zones of smooth bathymetry (Figure 6B每D). Using the clipped DTM as the input to the delineation tool, this tool is now capable of delineating individual pockmarks within the small basin (Figure 6E).
2.4.2 Feature Delineation
As explained in [9], pockmarks are generally represented by confined depressions in a DTM, therefore it is possible to employ hydrological algorithms such as the Fill function in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst to define what the lowest elevation on the rim of a sink depression point if the depression was being filled). In fact, ※Fill§ is one of the key algorithms of a sequence of steps used by the Feature Delineation [Bathy] tool as described by [9] and is used here to delineate pockmarks. Experience has shown that in certain regional settings, using the rim of the confined depression related to the presence of the pockmark may result in an underestimation of its size, especially in areas with steep slopes. To address this issue, the alternative Feature Delineation [Derived] tool was created, which can use the derived terrain attribute Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) calculated from the bathymetry data using Benthic Terrain Modeler toolbox [22] as the input, instead of the bathymetry data. BPI measures whether a certain location is higher or lower than the surrounding seabed by comparing the depth of each pixel with the mean depth of neighbouring pixels within a user-defined neighbourhood (inner and outer radii). The BPI value obtained for any pixel, however, depends on both the regional setting and the neighbourhood used in the BPI calculation. The values of BPI are also sensitive to data resolution. This alternative approach using BPI rather than bathymetry therefore introduces unavoidable sources of inconsistencies on the criterion used to map pockmarks in different study areas and is only recommended for use in more local studies.
Due to the limitations of the BPI approach mentioned above, in this study involving data from different regions, the pockmark delineation was done directly from the bathymetric data. Five values must be defined to run the Feature Delineation [Bathy] tool; these are the Cut-off Vertical Relief, Minimum Vertical Relief, Minimum Width, Minimum Width/Length Ratio, and Buffer Distance. The Cut-off Vertical Relief defines the contour line that will be used to delineate the features. The Minimum Vertical Relief, Minimum Width, and Minimum Size Ratio define which features will be mapped; only the features that present dimensions above the specified thresholds will be delineated. The Cut-off Vertical Relief and the Minimum Vertical Relief can be the same value. The defined Buffer Distance compensates for the fact that the delineation process is based on the feature＊s internal contour line corresponding the Cut-off Vertical Relief threshold. This parameter should approximate the distance, in plan-view, from the internal contour line delineated based on the Cut-off Vertical Relief to the actual rim of the feature. The greater the value of Cut-off Vertical Relief, the greater the Buffer Distance. Figure 7 illustrates the different mapping results obtained by choosing different Cut-off Vertical Relief and Buffer Distance values.
The North Sea pockmarks were mapped as part of [9] using the first version of the Feature Delineation [Bathy] tool, which did not require the Minimum Vertical Relief and used Minimum Area instead of the Minimum Width as one of the threshold values. The Minimum Width later replaced the Minimum Area threshold because it was found to be more user-friendly and easier to relate to the resolution of the dataset used as input. The thresholds used to map the North Sea pockmarks were Cut-off Vertical Relief (then referred to as Minimum Depth) of 0.5 m and Minimum Area of 100 square metres. Table 2 presents the respective values used for Malin Deep and Barents Sea study areas.
The output of the tool is a polygon shapefile that delineates the mapped features (pockmarks). The shapefile attribute table contains the following fields (1) Area; (2) Perimeter; (3) VRelief; (4) MBG_Width; (5) MBG_Length; (6) MBG_Orient; and (7) MBG_W_L. Area and Perimeter describe the geometry of each delineated feature. The VRelief provides the vertical relief measure for each delineated feature. The MBG_Width, MBG_Length, and MBG_Orient describe the Minimum Bounding Geometry (MBG) envelope that contains each delineated feature. MBG_W_L describes the aspect ratio of these envelope polygons. Jorge et al. [26] assessed the use of different automated methods to measure longitudinal bedform＊s morphometry. Although these authors focus on subglacial positive-relief bedform (e.g., drumlins), their conclusions are still relevant to the morphometry measurements of pockmarks. They established that the MBG approach provides the most suitable measurements, from the tested methods, for both Orientation and Length, only showing a wider range of errors for the measurement of the Longitudinal Asymmetry, which is not used in this study.
The output shapefiles from the delineation tool require visual assessment as part of a semi-automatic workflow. Visual assessment of the polygons can be performed by overlaying the generated shapefile onto both the original bathymetric data and derived surfaces, such as the slope map. This allows a check on the mapping results and assessment of the need to manually edit sporadic polygons and/or to add features that were missed by the automated method. Additionally, the visual assessment can be complemented by an analysis of the values reported in the table of attributes.
2.5. Morphometric Analysis
In addition to the morphological attributes extracted by the characterization tool, extra
morphological size and shape ratios can also be calculated. This includes the Vertical Relief to Area (VR/A) ratio. To characterize the profile of the pockmarks, we also define a Profile Indicator (PI) by the following equation:
This morphologic PI ratio can help to distinguish between depressions with a V-shape profile, more typical of single pockmarks, and the depressions with a U-shape profile, more common on complex pockmarks. V-shape pockmarks will generate lower values of PI compared to the pockmarks with a U-shape (Figure 8).
3. Results
3.1. Witch Ground Basin〞North Sea
A total of 4146 pockmarks, deeper than 50 cm, were mapped in theWitch Ground Basin. Here, we present the general trends and measures for the whole basin, but [9] summarizes the descriptive measurements for each of the individual site survey areas.
The highest pockmark density occurs within the survey site Roisin in the centre of the basin, with a pockmark density of almost 30 pockmarks per square kilometre (Figure 9). The density of pockmarks decreases from the centre of the basin where water depths exceed 150 m, to less than 5 per km2 on the edge of the basin where water depths are around 120 m. However, more than the changes in water depth, the number of pockmarks seems to be controlled by the thickness of the very soft late glacial sediments within which the pockmarks are developed. This is greatest in the centre of the basin but thins towards the edge.
The mean vertical relief of the pockmarks is 1.82 m, with most pockmarks between 1 and 2.4 m deep (Q1 and Q3, respectively). However, in SEA2 Box 4, there are five pockmarks deeper than 12 m and one of them reaches almost 18 m deep (Figure 10A). These unusually large pockmarks, in UK license block 15/25, have long been known as sites of active seepage [27每29]. None of the datasets exhibit a significant variation of vertical relief with water depth (Figure 10B).
The mean area of the pockmarks is 3222 m2, with half of the pockmarks between 1960 (Q1) and 5385 m2 (Q3). The pockmark area does not follow a trend from the centre to the edge of the basin. However, it does show a strong correlation between vertical relief and pockmark area (Figure 11). With the exception of the Rob Roy dataset, all the other datasets studied in the Witch Ground Basin show a marked trend where pockmarks with higher vertical reliefs have greater areas. The reason why the Rob Roy dataset does not present the same trend as the rest of the dataset will be discussed later.
Comparison between the Results from the BGS Semi-Automatic Approach and from the Pixel-Based Analysis
As shown in Figure 12, the Feature Delineation [Bathy] tool successfully delineates pockmarks across a range of sizes and with different sizes and shapes. Results from pixel-based analyses are more varied in their ability to delineate the various morphologies of the pockmarks in this area. Some examples are shown in Figure 13.
The first terrain attribute tested was slope, initially tested using standard 3 * 3 pixel analysis and Horn＊s algorithm [20] in ArcGIS＊ Spatial Analyst. Using a colour ramp classified by natural breaks (Figure 13A), we see that all the pockmarks delineated by the BGS tool are highlighted by the slope map. The difficulty lies in finding a slope cut-off value that would delimit pockmarks of different morphologies, and in representing the entire pockmark. For instance, some pockmarks in SEA2 Box 4 present an asymmetric profile (Figure 2c), with steep northern slopes facing very elongated southern slopes, and a delineation based on slope would tend to delineate a crescent shape whilst missing the areas of very gentle slope. Testing larger analysis windows and using methods for generating multiple scale slopes (Table 1) has shown that increasing the analysis window is of limited value as the extent of the pockmarks can become overestimated. As with all raster outputs of pixel-based analyses, it is important to be conscious of the influence of colour ramp choice on visual interpretation.
Both marine geoscientists and marine biologists have used BPI widely [10,30]. BPI can be computed using the BTM toolbox [22]. For this study, only fine-scale BPI was calculated, testing the inner and outer radii indicated in Table 2. Figure 13B shows fine-scale BPI with inner radius 1 (i.e., 2 m) and outer radius 15 (i.e., 30 m). The areas with negative BPI give a good delineation of the larger pockmarks, including the base. However, using this neighbourhood, we fail to capture the smaller, shallower, pockmarks, due to the integer rounding inherent in the tool. Decreasing the outer radius to try to capture the smaller pockmarks is not successful and results in fewer pockmarks being detected overall. Increasing the inner radius has a negligible effect on the delineation.
http://The small, shallow pockmarks can be detected with a modified version of BPI without integer rounding (Figure 13C, Table 2). This result is more successful at highlighting the small pockmarks as well as most of the larger ones, but it also detects artefacts in the MBES data, which are of a similar magnitude to the BPI values within parts of the pockmarks.
Like BPI, measures of curvature also highlight positive and negative features of the terrain. We first tested standard, 3 * 3 curvature in ArcGIS＊ Spatial Analyst [24] with the results shown in Figure 13D. This, like Figure 13C, shows up artefacts in data in addition to pockmarks, but in this case, it is even more difficult to separate the artefacts and the pockmarks from the curvature values. It is clear that larger, alternate analysis scales are required that overlook the artefacts and find the pockmarks.
We have also tested two measures of curvature that can be generated at multiple scales in the GRASS module r.param.scale (Table 1). Minimum curvature (Figure 13E) should find the inflexion point in the bathymetry surface corresponding to the pockmark and is reasonably successful in capturing entire pockmarks spanning a range of sizes, although some artefacts are also highlighted. Profile curvature [21] describes the rate of change of slope along a profile of the surface and can be useful in highlighting convex or concave slopes in the bathymetry surface. This appears to be one of the most successful pixel-based approaches to delineating the various sizes of pockmarks in the study area; however, we note that artefacts at the eastern edge of the dataset are also detected.
Various properties of curvature are combined in feature classification. We tested the feature classification from r.param.scale [21]. Here, we show only the ＆pit＊ class output which identifies depressions in the surface and seems well matched the detection of pockmarks (Figure 14). Experimenting with analysis windows at multiple scales, it is clear that the 9 * 9 analysis window fails to separate out pockmarks from artefacts in the data. A larger analysis window of 15 * 15 successfully detects the small-medium size pockmarks but fails to capture the larger ones. Consequently, we see that larger analysis windows of 27 * 27 and 51 * 51 cells find the larger and largest pockmarks, respectively, but overlook the small ones.
It appears that some of the pixel-based methods tested here can give good results where pockmarks are of a relatively uniform size. Whereas, multiple scale analysis can be employed to detect features of different sizes if required. It is challenging, however, to find a single scale of analysis and analysis type that detects all pockmarks and delineates the entire feature. Further, with the exception of the feature classification, the user must determine a suitable cut-off value in the terrain attribute (BPI, curvature etc.) to use as the limit of the pockmark. If such a value can be used, then these raster outputs of pixel-based terrain analysis can be used as a basis for conversion to vector features (shapefiles), should these be required for the application in question. Following conversion to polygon features, area attributes can be applied to the pockmarks. However, the areas may not be a consistent representation of all complete pockmarks due to the dependence on the raster cut-off value, which may well be a compromise between pockmarks of different morphometry. Manual editing of the polygons may therefore be a necessary expert-driven step in the mapping process. Pixel-based terrain analysis, based on the type of methods illustrated here, does not provide any estimate of pockmark depth or volume. Methods such as Geomorphons [31], which are designed to simultaneously identify landform elements across a wider range of scales, may be more suitable, although they face similar limitations in terms of the metrics they provide, unless combined with other methods.
3.2. Malin Basin 
Due to the artefacts present in this dataset, it was necessary to smooth the bathymetry before applying the delineation tool (Section 2.5). As a consequence of this smoothing, the vertical relief of the pockmarks was most likely underestimated and shallow pockmarks were not detected, or where detected, their area may well be underestimated (Figure 15).
Nevertheless, after smoothing and clipping the bathymetry using the Filter-based Clip Tool, the Delineation Tool identified 150 pockmarks with a vertical relief greater than 20 cm (Figure 16) within the Malin Basin. Pockmarks were mapped in water depths ranging from 126 to 177 m, but most of the pockmarks are found in water depths below 167 m (Figure 16B). The largest mapped pockmark is at least 5.5 m deep, but 75% of the pockmarks are shallower than 60 cm, and the mean vertical relief is 36 cm (Figure 17). We also remark that all the pockmarks with vertical relief higher than one metre occur at water depths deeper than 168 m (Figure 16A). The pockmark area varies from 2000 m2 to almost 303,000 m2, with a mean value of 32,073 m2. Whereas, the pockmark length varies from the smallest pockmark with less than 50 m to the largest with 785 m long. They tend to be quite concentric, with a mean size ratio of 0.83.
Previously, 214 depression deeper than 0.5 m had been mapped manually [32]. When comparing the manual mapping with automated mapping, it is evident that fewer pockmarks were identified by the Delineation Tool, especially in the steeper areas (Figure 18). Almost 80% of the pockmarks that were not mapped automatically are located flanks of the Malin Deep, where the smoothing of the data has a stronger impact on the automatic recognition of shallow pockmarks. However, within the centre of the basin, the delineation tool detected several pockmarks that were not manually mapped. Some of the missed pockmarks are deeper than 0.5 m and therefore would fulfil the requirements used for the manual mapping. This illustrates the ability of the automatic tools to recognise subtle features that can escape the attention of expert examination.
Based on the manual mapping, the pockmarks were described as being between 40 and 850 m wide, and up to 8.5 m deep, with a mean length of 124 m and mean vertical relief of 1.02 m [32]. These measurements present higher vertical relief than the values extracted by the semi-automatic method. We believe that this difference also results from the need to smooth, in this case, the bathymetry before applying the Feature Delineation [Bathy] tool.
3.3. Barents Sea 
The Barents Sea dataset is characterized by the presence of vast numbers of pockmarks. These are the main topographic features present, but there are also a few iceberg ploughmarks, which can be a kilometre long. After applying the Filter-based Clip Tool, to avoid the erroneous delineation of ploughmarks as pockmarks, the Feature Delineation [Bathy] tool identified and delineated more than 35,000 pockmarks in two hours. These were then characterized by using the Feature Description tool. 
The pockmarks are found in water depths ranging from 255 to 305 m, with half of all pockmarks located between 275 and 291 m. The mean pockmark vertical relief is 2.2 m, but some can be up to 7 m deep. The pockmark area varies from 538 m2 to more than 11,000 m2, but most are less than 1643 m2 (Q3). Their length measure, using the MBG envelope, varies from just 25 m to more than 220 m. They tend to be concentric with a mean MBG_Width/MBG_Length ratio of 0.88. Figure 19 shows the relationship between vertical relief and area for the pockmarks mapped in the Barents Sea dataset. Almost 80% of the pockmark polygons followed a distinct distribution compared to the remaining pockmarks, with a higher VR:A ratio (Figure 19). By selecting these, it became evident in GIS that these polygons corresponded to the single pockmarks (Figure 19), whereas the polygons with a lower VR:A ratio corresponded to pockmarks with a more complex geometry and with multiple possible venting points.
By separating these two populations, using the following function:
It was possible to study their morphologic characteristic separately. Table 3 shows some of the metrics extracted from these two types of pockmarks.
The mean area of the complex pockmarks is almost twice the mean area of the single pockmarks and the larger of the complex pockmarks can be almost one order of magnitude larger than the single pockmarks (Figure 20). However, the mean vertical relief of these features shows only a slight increase from 2.12 to 2.5, from the single to the complex pockmarks group, respectively (Figure 20). The mean value for the profile indicator for the complex pockmarks is 0.38, whereas the mean PI value for the single pockmarks is 0.33 (Figure 20). These values indicate that the single pockmarks will have profiles closer to the V-shape compared to the complex pockmarks.
The stacked histogram in Figure 21A shows that, contrary to the other two regions, the pockmarks with the highest vertical relief tend to occur in deeper waters. This is not the result of a preferential occurrence of complex pockmarks in deeper waters as both types of pockmarks exhibit a trend of increase in vertical relief with water depth (Figure 21B). However, it should be noticed that changes in water depth in itself should not be the reason for this trend. Differences in the depositional environment linked to the water depth (e.g., thickness of soft, fine-grained postglacial deposits) are expected to be the primary parameter driving the observed increase of vertical relief with water depth. Other factors linked to the gas release could also be responsible for such a trend.
3.4. Geomorphometric 
Comparison between the Different Areas Due to the systematic and consistent mapping approach adopted, the morphological attributes used in this study to describe the pockmarks can be employed to compare the morphology and trends between different areas. For example, we see a clear distinction in the vertical relief of pockmarks from the three study areas (Figure 22).
The North Sea study area is the one where the pockmarks exhibit the highest vertical relief. However, these usually large pockmarks are just five outliers to the general trend that exceed 12 m, whilst the mean value of Vertical Relief is only 1.8 m. The Barents Sea dataset shows the highest Vertical Relief mean value, which is almost four times higher than the mean value calculated for the Malin Basin dataset. Nonetheless, the Malin Basin shows the highest Area mean value; it is one order of magnitude bigger than the mean values for the other two datasets (North Sea: 4798 m2 and Barents Sea: 1462 m2).
http://All the study areas show a positive correlation between vertical relief and area, controlled by the angle of repose. However, the strength of this correlation and the ratio between these two morphometric variables varies from region to region (Figure 23). The pockmarks from the Barents Sea present the highest VR/A mean value; where the single pockmarks have and complex pockmarks. Nevertheless, even the complex pockmarks that tend be less deep than their single pockmark counterparts (i.e., with the same vertical relief), tend to have higher VR/A values than the pockmarks from the North Sea. The Malin Basin pockmarks present much lower VR/A values but, as mentioned earlier, their vertical relief is significantly affected by the smoothing applied to the dataset, leading to artificially lower VR/A values. The regional correlation coefficients calculated for the three study areas are, respectively, 0.72, 0.57, and 0.67 for the North Sea, the Barents Sea, and the Malin Basin (Figure 23). The correlation is even stronger if looking either to individual study areas within the Witch Ground Basin〞R * 0.85 for most survey areas, or individual type of pockmarks〞e.g., R = 0.94 for the single pockmarks within the Barents Sea〞the highest observed correlation coefficient in this study (Figure 24).
4. DISSUSSION
It has been widely shown that human-cognitive approaches, i.e., manual mapping, have a number of limitations such as scale bias, azimuth bias, and operator bias e.g., [33,34]. These limitations have encouraged new research into automated and semi-automated GIS-based mapping routines across many sub-disciplines of quantitative geomorphology [35]. In various fields of terrestrial geomorphology, pixel-based analysis techniques have been used with much success to discretize landform elements or the separable constituents of landforms, such as ridges or peaks [36,37]. However, integrating landform elements to characterize individual landforms has proven more problematic and requires subjective operator decision inputs (e.g., [38]). More recently, objectoriented approaches for automated mapping have become favoured in the terrestrial geomorphological community, whereby remote sensing imagery is segmented into meaningful objects, whose characteristics are assessed through spatial, spectral, and temporal scales [36每38].
As highlighted by [39], the availability of high-quality seabed DTMs and quantitative analyses of these data for delineation of seabed features is much more recent. We are aware of several attempts among the seabed mapping community to delineate individual pockmarks using pixel-based analysis of bathymetric data to produce terrain attributes that highlight the negative features (e.g., slope, curvature). However, there are few published studies, which may be due to the limited success of these approaches. A promising feature extraction method, based on kernel matching and machine learning, was developed by [40], but their approach, developed on synthetic data with limited testing on real-world data, does not seem to have made the crossover from computer science method development to further use in applied seabed mapping. Although other feature extraction methods such as [21] or [31] have been applied to other seabed geomorphic features, to our knowledge, they have not been applied to the delineation of pockmarks. The methods of [21] are among those tested here, but the application of the Geomorphon approach of [31] which is starting to gain attention for marine applications (e.g., [41,42]) has not yet been tested for pockmark delineation. Future applications of this method may benefit from the developments to the method reported by [42], especially where the pockmarks also have a characteristic MBES backscatter signature. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is currently gaining momentum in the seabed mapping community for seabed classification and delineation of features (e.g., [43每45]). The approach seems suitable for application to the delineation of features such as pockmarks, but we are not aware of any published studies.
These methods vary in complexity depending on the data available for the seabed classification and the approach used but are all much more complex than the approach presented here. The BGS Seabed Mapping Toolbox provides a simple extension to ArcGIS functionality that gives the user the possibility to extract morphologic information of a vast number of pockmarks from multiple surveys in a systematic and consistent way. All that is required from the user is the informed definition a limited number of thresholds. This is a significant advantage within the context of a national scale mapping programme, since it would be challenging for multiple interpreters to maintain consistent criteria throughout the laborious process of manual mapping. Such standardisation may also be difficult to achieve for pixel- or object-based classification, and none of the alternative methods identified so far address the need for morphological characterisation in addition to delineation. The BGS toolbox, although simpler than some potential alternative methods, provides both delineation and characterisation of the pockmarks. This appears to be well matched to the needs of national mapping programmes (see also Section 4.4).
Regardless of the mapping approach used for the delineation of the bedforms, it is crucial to understand how the resolution and data quality will influence morphometric studies of bedforms. Although this has been stressed in certain fields of terrestrial geomorphology that rely on the use of DTMs, relatively little attention has been paid to this to date in marine geomorphological studies. As a result, there is currently a lack of studies assessing how seabed mapping and morphometric characterisation are influenced by variations in the grid cell size or data quality. These types of studies could advise on the optimum resolution depending on the dimensions of the features studied, as well as establishing protocols for dealing with datasets where the fidelity of the DTM is sub-optimal.
4.1. Importance of Pockmarks Geomorphometric Characterization 
Although it is widely accepted that pockmarks are a superficial expression of fluid flow, their formation mechanism is still elusive. Quantitative morphological data can be an important source of information in addressing this question. As we have demonstrated, quantitative analysis of pockmark morphology can provide valuable insights into the factors that control their formation and development. Supported by the wider availability of high resolution bathymetry data and appropriate DTM-based methodologies for morphometric analysis, we hope that more studies linking morphological trends to geological processes will be forthcoming in the literature, such as the one in this Special Issue by [46]. We hope the results of such studies will also be carried forward in validating numerical models of the development of seabed features.
Further, we note that with better understanding the factors controlling the morphology and spatial distribution of pockmarks, their morphometric characteristics could be used as proxies to subsurface conditions, local hydrodynamics, or fluid flow regime. As mentioned in Section 2.1, [9] shows that in the Witch Ground Basin, the thickness of very soft late glacial sediments seems to control the number of pockmarks. In this area, pockmark density maps can be used to predict variation in the thickness of the Witch Ground Formation. However, in areas of the South Western Barents Sea, according to [17], pockmark distribution seems to be almost independent of the Quaternary sediment thickness, although the authors do report an inferred correlation between pockmark size and the thickness of fine-grained deposits. This reflects the complex development of these seabed features and the fact that morphometric characteristics of pockmarks extracted from bathymetry data as proxies to subsurface conditions or flow regimes are somewhat restricted to variations within a certain regional setting.
Even if the actual development of pockmarks is not yet totally understood, there is evidence that lateral collapse of the pockmarks sidewall is a key process for the widening of the pockmarks (e.g., [47]). Therefore, it is valid to conclude that the geotechnical characteristics of the sediments affected will have a crucial role in the ratio between vertical relief developed and area affected by the seepage. Areas with sediment packages comprised of stiffer material will sustain steeper slopes and show higher rations between vertical relief and area. Therefore, a gradual and systematic mapping of the pockmarks, complemented with data on the local geotechnical characteristics would be an invaluable resource that could facilitate the use of this morphometric ratio as an indicator of the sediment proprieties. 
Multibeam datasets can provide bathymetric data over vast areas of the seabed more economically than any sub-surface acoustic system. It would seem advantageous for both the scientific community and any commercial sector that requires seabed infrastructures to utilize the bathymetric data for many more quantitative analyses of seabed morphometry than are currently in common use.
4.2. Impact of Data Resolution and Quality 
Although the BGS semi-automated mapping approach provided robust results for most areas, it was affected by the resolution and quality of the bathymetric dataset used. This is particularly evident when comparing the results between the different datasets from the Witch Ground Basin. The results obtained for the Rob Roy survey are a good example of the impact of using a dataset with an insufficient resolution for morphological studies. The lower resolution of the data from the Rob Roy dataset, a 10 m grid, prevented both the correct identification and delineation of the pockmarks at the seabed. This is evident by comparing the pockmark density of the adjacent survey site, Ivanhoe, which has a pockmark density of 13.8 pockmarks per km2, with the pockmark density within the Rob Roy dataset, which is only 4.81 (Figure 9). As noted by [9], this apparent abrupt reduction of pockmark occurrence between these adjacent study areas does not appear to be controlled by: (1) marked changes in the underlying geology; (2) distinct fluid flow regime; or (3) variation in the nature of the seabed sediments. It can best be explained by the lower resolution of the Rob Roy bathymetric dataset. The lower resolution also affected the morphometric characterization of the pockmarks, in particular the measurements of vertical relief. The vertical relief mean value defined was merely 0.87 m, whereas the mean value for the adjacent area, Ivanhoe, is 1.22 m. The Rob Roy pockmarks are described as having significantly lower vertical relief values than any other study area within the North Sea. No significant changes in the morphometry of the pockmarks between the datasets with 1, 2, and 5 m resolution were evident.
This comparison suggests an optimum resolution (i.e., the coarsest resolution, providing efficiency for measurement, computing time and data storage, at which detail is not sacrificed) of at least 5 m for the dimensions of the pockmarks found in the North Sea. However, to accurately define the optimum resolution, multiple resolution datasets from the same area should be used to assess the effect of resolution on the morphometry measurement of pockmarks. That analysis goes beyond the scope of this work, but as seabed mapping continues to integrate morphometric analyses of bedforms based on digital data, it is crucial to understand how bathymetric data resolution influences morphometric variables related to bedforms.
The dataset from the Malin Deep provides a valuable insight into the potential impact of bathymetric data quality on the detection of pockmarks. Whilst reasonable results may be obtained by employing methods such as smoothing to reduce the effect of the artefacts, it is hard to overcome the inherent limitations of the dataset entirely and it should be acknowledged that there are quality issues affecting the results besides those related to data resolution. Lecours et al. [48] recently showed how heave, pitch, roll, and timing artefacts in MBES bathymetry impact habitat maps and species distribution models which utilise bathymetry data and derived terrain attributes as predictor variables. Their results show that artefacts can lead to misleading and counterintuitive results. For similar reasons to those given for data resolution, the assessment of data quality is equally important for the delineation and quantitative characterisation of bedforms.
4.3. Impact of Regional Morphology 
The Malin Basin dataset has demonstrated that the mapping output of the BGS Feature Delineation [Bathy] tool under represents small features located on slopes. These features are not distinguished using bathymetric data alone, and when identified, their vertical relief is frequently underestimated. For that type of setting, a semi-automated approach based on the BPI, as presented by [49], could be more effective. These features are not distinguished using bathymetric data alone, and when identified, their vertical relief is frequently underestimated. However, it should be noted that for statistical comparison, the mapping based on the BPI would not provide the same consistency of delineation criterion as it is based on a relative defined value depending on the surrounding neighbourhood.
4.4. Mapping Strategies at Multiple Scales 
The output of a quantitative tool like the BGS mapping toolbox is well suited to providing information on several levels of detail to suit the particular mapping purpose and scale of map product. The present study has only illustrated the implementation of the toolbox on relatively small datasets, but the method is suitable for application to larger datasets subject to computing resources and/or with tiling of the bathymetric data.
Whilst some investigations may require the delineation of individual pockmarks on detailed maps at a 1:20,000 scale or finer, others rather use this information as a basis for providing a summarized quantification of properties of the pockmarks. For example, in producing maps at a 1:100,000 scale or greater, the MAREANO programme is interested in mapping polygons indicating ※pockmark areas§ to provide information for management authorities on the location and extent of these terrain features, which may be linked to particular habitats. This is currently done by expert judgement, but the output of the BGS toolbox provides a quantitative indication of pockmark density that will be useful for defining objective criteria for defining the limits of a pockmark field. Further, summary statistics on the size and shape of the pockmarks can be attributed to such polygons.
Depending on the scale used, it can be impractical, or even pointless, to represent individual pockmarks in a map. In the context of regional mapping, the use of density contours is often the best approach to capture the number and spatial distribution of these seabed features. Figure 25 shows the type of pockmark density map that can be generated for the Barents Sea study area based on the outputs from the BGS Seabed Mapping Toolbox. This figure was generated using the point shapefile that represents the deepest point in each polygon. The density values range from 60 to almost 600 pockmarks per square kilometre, and the density shading highlights geographical trends in the distribution.
Even in a situation where the end-user does not require the pockmark density distribution displayed on the map and only the outline of pockmark field is needed, there are advantages to using a density contour line to outline the limits of a pockmark field. This approach increases the efficiency of pockmarks fields＊ delineation, improves the consistency of the mapping, and prevents any discrepancies between the mapping of adjacent areas. In addition, subjectivity issues related to manually defining the limits of a pockmark field are greatly reduced by using a more automatic approach.
5. CONCLUSIONS
This study explored the potential of a practical and effective semi-automatic approach for mapping pockmarks that is fully integrated within commonly used GIS software. A total of 39,533 pockmarks were mapped, across three different geological settings within the European Glaciated Margin, each of which can be considered a test case study for that setting. The results from the semi-automatic mapping exercise using the BGS Seabed Mapping Toolbox were compared to other mapping approaches, demonstrating that the semi-automatic mapping approach presented here is a valid and useful alternative. Our approach overcomes the subjectivity intrinsic to manual delineation of pockmarks, and is also considerably quicker. The results of this study indicate that this approach is more flexible than pixel-based delineation methods when dealing with pockmarks of varying sizes. Moreover, this approach incorporates the automatic extraction of the morphometric attributes of the pockmarks. This information facilitates an unprecedented statistical analysis of their morphology and the analysis of spatial trends within the pockmark fields, providing insights into the processes responsible for their development and the influence of local seabed conditions. Whilst the study has focussed on the delineation of individual pockmarks, we have also shown how our quantitative methodology, once applied to larger datasets, can provide a convenient and objective basis for summarizing pockmark distribution at broader map scales in a consistent way, increasing the relevance of the mapping results to multiple end users.
Shallow stratigraphic control on pockmark distribution in north temperate estuaries

ABSTRACT
Pockmark fields occur throughout northern North American temperate estuaries despite the absence of extensive thermogenic hydrocarbon deposits typically associated with pockmarks. In such settings, the origins of the gas and triggering mechanism(s) responsible for pockmark formation are not obvious. Nor is it known why pockmarks proliferate in this region but do not occur south of the glacial terminus in eastern North America. This paper tests two hypotheses addressing these knowledge gaps: 1) the region's unique sea-level history provided a terrestrial deposit that sourced the gas responsible for pockmark formation; and 2) the region's physiography controls pockmarks distribution. This study integrates over 2500 km of high-resolution swath bathymetry, Chirp seismic reflection profiles and vibracore data acquired in three estuarine pockmark fields in the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy. Vibracores sampled a hydric paleosol lacking the organic-rich upper horizons, indicating that an organic-rich terrestrial deposit was eroded prior to pockmark formation. This observation suggests that the gas, which is presumably responsible for the formation of the pockmarks, originated in Holocene estuarine sediments (loss on ignition 3.5每10%), not terrestrial deposits that were subsequently drowned and buried by mud. The 7470 pockmarks identified in this study are non-randomly clustered. Pockmark size and distribution relate to Holocene sediment thickness (r2=0.60), basin morphology and glacial deposits. The irregular underlying topography that dictates Holocene sediment thickness may ultimately play a more important role in temperate estuarine pockmark distribution than drowned terrestrial deposits. These results give insight into the conditions necessary for pockmark formation in nearshore coastal environments.

1.INTRODUCTION
Most often interpreted as fluid-escape features, pockmarks, or seafloor depressions, are well studied in areas with gas hydrates, abundant tectonic activity, deltas and petroleum resources (Judd and Hovland, 2007). However, large pockmarks also persist in environments lacking those characteristics (e.g., Kelley et al., 1994; Webb et al., 2009), and that presently exhibit minimal fluid venting (Ussler et al., 2003). Constrained to fine-grained substrates and typically associated with subsurface gas (Judd and Hovland, 2007), the factors that determine why pockmarks scar some gassy seafloors while other muddy embayments remain relatively flat are unknown. In eastern North America pockmark fields are not reported south of Long Island Sound (Fleisher et al., 2001; Poppe et al., 2006), despite the abundance of well-studied, gassy, muddy estuaries (e.g., Reeburgh, 1969; Schubel, 1974; Hagen and Vogt, 1998; Martens et al., 1998). The absence of pockmarks south of the glacial terminus suggests that local and regional heterogeneities, possibly related to glacial or sea-level history or bedrock geology, influence pockmark field distribution (e.g., Rogers et al., 2006). This paper focuses on three estuarine pockmark fields in the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy (Figs. 1每3; Table 1). Using densely gridded, high-resolution geophysical data combined with vibracore results we test the hypotheses that deposits formed during lower-than-present sea level source the gas responsible for pockmarks, and that regional physiography contributes to pockmark distribution in northern temperate estuaries. These results provide insights into origins of regional shallow gas, shallowfluidmigration pathways, and the set up conditions necessary for pockmark formation.
2.REGIONAL SETTING
Metamorphic and igneous bedrock, ranging from Precambrian to Paleozoic age, frame Maine's coast (Osberg et al., 1985), while igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary bedrock typify the Bay of Fundy (Cumming, 1967). Differential erosion of bedrock associated with glaciations, coupled with Holocene sea-level rise, formed an irregular coastal and inner shelf region characterized by numerous estuaries and bays (Kelley, 1987; Kelley et al., 1989), and littered by pockmarks (Rogers et al., 2006). In cross section, the coastal embayments are 10每 60 m deep bedrock-framed depressions filled with sediment termed ＆nearshore b layers would occur at the base of the Holocene in topographic lows
where it was protected from the erosive effects of the last transgression.asins＊ (Kelley and Belknap, 1991). As these topographic lows extend seaward they become scoured, seaward sloping troughs, termed ＆shelf valleys＊ (Kelley and Belknap, 1991; Barnhardt et al., 1996, 2009). The origin of underlying depressions is unknown, though they may reflect faulting (Osberg et al., 1985), fluvial erosion (Johnson, 1925), glacial scour (Shepard, 1931), some combination of the three mechanisms (Uchupi, 1968), or even subglacial meltwater pathways as inferred elsewhere (Boyd et al., 1988).
During deglaciation, approximately 15 ka (Dorion et al., 2001), sea level was ~75 m above the present coastline of Maine (Belknap et al., 1987). By 12.5 ka it had fallen to a lowstand position 60 mbelow present sea level (Kelley et al., 2010). Sea level then rose quickly from the lowstand until ~11 ka when the rate of rise slowed significantly until 7.5 ka. During that 'slowstand' period widespread erosion of glaciogenic deposits occurred and was accompanied by concurrent deposition of reworked sediment into beaches and coastal wetlands. These deposits were subsequently drowned during the rapid sea-level rise after 7.5 ka (Kelley et al., 2010).
Extensive geophysical surveys indicate thatmethane and pockmarks occur in Holocene sediments throughout Maine and New Brunswick's muddy estuaries (Scanlon and Knebel, 1989; Shipp, 1989; Fader, 1991; Barnhardt et al., 1996; Gontz, 2005; Rogers et al., 2006). Inconsistent evidence for venting (Kelley et al., 1994; Ussler et al., 2003), a dearth of methanotropes (Wildish et al., 2008), and nominal seafloor change (Brothers et al., 2011a) suggests these pockmark fields currently experience minimal fluid-escape activity. Geochemical sampling (Ussler et al., 2003) suggest that the region's methane is microbial in origin, although the stratigraphic source of the gas remains undetermined. Barnhardt et al. (1997), Gontz (2005) and Kelley et al. (2010) found micro-and macro-fossil evidence for drowned coastal wetlands in core sampling, and Rogers et al. (2006) proposed that such deposits provided a concentrated source of organic material that evolved into methane, and, by inference, formed regional pockmarks. They suggested such organic layers would occur at the base of the Holocene in topographic lows where it was protected from the erosive effects of the last transgression.
3.METHODS
3.1 Geophysical data
Over the last two decades four organizations collected swath bathymetry and dense grids of high-resolution seismic reflection data in the Belfast Bay, Blue Hill Bay, Maine, and Passamaquoddy Bay, New Brunswick (Table 2). Survey tracklines were spaced 100每200 m apart. Bathymetry data were collected and processed using techniques described in Andrews et al. (2010) and by the Ocean Mapping Group (2012a). Pockmark locations and sizewere extracted fromthe bathymetry data as point features, and the fields spatially examined, using methods presented by Andrews et al. (2010). Where seismic data were available, we generated isopach maps of the Holocene sediment by subtracting interpreted surfaces from each other (Fig. 4). Different seismic data were collected using different systems and frequencies that are described in Table 2. Sediment thickness in Blue Hill Bay could not be mapped due to the prevalence of acoustic turbidity in the upper sediment column that obscures lower units.
3.2 Vibracore samples
Since 2007, 37 Rossfelder vibracore samples (1每7 m in length) have been collected in the Belfast Bay pockmark field (Supplemental material for latitudes, and longitudes) (Fig. 5). Cores were collected with the methods described by Barnhardt et al. (1997), and were evaluated for sediment texture, color, water content, loss on ignition (LOI) by weight and the presence of macrofossils. Three logs of vibracore samples collected by Barnhardt (1994) are also used in this study.
4.RESULTS
4.1 Pockmark field stratigraphy
Seismic reflection profiles and core samples were used to define the stratigraphy of pockmark fields in all three estuaries. Interpretations of units follow those of Belknap and Shipp (1991), Barnhardt et al. (1997) and Belknap et al. (2002).
4.1.1 Unit BR-Bedrock
The basal reflector identified in seismic profiles has a high-intensity return, and a highly irregular surface with relief up to tens of meters over short horizontal distances (Fig. 6). The surface of this unit is shaped into basins that, generally, trend fromnortherly to southerly quadrants. Interpreted as bedrock, this facies is identified throughout all three study areas, but acoustic turbidity related to gas in the upper sediment column can obscure it (Fig. 7). The unit was not sampled by vibracores.
4.1.2 Unit T
Unit T has a strong surface reflector that overlies bedrock and is sometimes difficult to distinguish from bedrock where the unit is thin. Irregularly distributed in ridge-like deposits throughout the study areas, Unit T is interpreted as till. These deposits trend north每south in Belfast and Blue Hill Bay, and northwest每southeast in Passamaquoddy Bay. Large pebbles and cobbles (6-cm diameter) typify this unit in core samples.
4.1.3 Unit GM
With a moderate-intensity, continuous surface return, this unit is either acoustically massive or highly stratified. Filling bedrock basins,Unit GM occurs throughout all three estuaries. Where imaged, deeper deposits drape over bedrock, while shallower deposits exhibit ponded geometry (Fig. 6). GM deposits range from 0 m to >25 m in thickness. The surface of GM is often an unconformity and overlain by Holocene gravel, sand, or mud. Lithologically the unit consists of bluish-gray (5B 4/1, 5BG 4/1) stiff sediments with low organic contents (b5% LOI). Based on these acoustic and lithologic characteristics, we interpret Unit GM as Pleistocene-age glacial-marine sediments, which are well documented in the region (e.g., Belknap and Shipp, 1991; Fader, 1991).
In seven core samples the upper 0.1每0.7 m of Unit GM transitioned from blue-grey (5BG 4/1) to mottled red (10 YR 3/6) sandy mud, and contained indurated mud clasts and soft mud masses (Fig. 8). Mud clasts ranged from 1 to 7 cm in diameter and were rounded, angular pebbles or highly irregular, contorted, pipe-like fragments (Fig. 9). The hardest clasts were generally greenish brown (5G4/2, 5G 5/2, 5GY 6/1) and contained holes ranging from b0.1 cm to 1 cm in diameter. Other clasts had a soft blue-gray surface coating (5BG 5/1), but internally had yellow-red (10YR 3/6) bandings and iron nodules. Soft masses shared the same color patterns as clasts, but were amorphous and easily manipulated by hand. All features tested negative for calcium carbonate when treated with 10% hydrochloric acid, and x-ray diffraction analyses revealed no carbonates. These clasts and masses had LOI values of < 5%.
4.1.4 Basal unconformity (U) 
A high amplitude acoustic reflection on seismic profiles separates Pleistocene and Holocene deposits. This surface commonly truncates the internal reflections in the glacial-marine unit indicating that it is an erosional surface (Fig. 6). In core samples this surface is coarse-grained (Fig. 8).
4.1.5 Unit B
Unit B overlies the basal unconformity and has a maximum thickness of 6 m. Of the three estuaries examined, it was only imaged in Belfast Bay. The unit occurs in patches in the western and northern portion of Belfast Bay, with its most continuous expression as a wedge that thins from 6-m thickness closest to the present shoreline and diminishes in the field's interior (Figs. 5 and 6). The unit also occurs as isolated pools between bedrock, or till, subcrops. The unit lacks internal bedding, and was not sampled by vibracores.
4.1.6 Unit M 
The uppermost acoustic unit is transparent. Unit M occurs in all the examined fields, and locally may exceed 40 m in thickness (Fig. 4). Pockmarks occur solely within this unit. The bottoms of some pockmarks extend to the base of this unit and terminate at the basal unconformity. Unit M is interpreted as estuarine mud of Holocene age. In Belfast Bay the thickest deposits occur in the center of the embayment while Holocene sediment thins in shallow portions of the bay, and in the southern thalweg. In Passamaquoddy Bay, where seismic data were available, the thickest sediments occur along the strike of bedrock. In both fields, zones of minimal Holocene sediment thickness correspond to moraines, drumlins, and bedrock outcrops (Fig. 4). 
Of the 37 cores collected, 28 were entirely within Unit M, while the remaining 9 also sampled an older, deeper facies. Unit M generally has Munsell colors of reddish brown (2.5 Y 4/2 and 10YR 5/2) in the first 0.1 to 0.2 m, transitioning to dull olive gray (5Y 5/1 and 5Y 4/1) downcore. Texturally the unit consists of structureless mud to sandy mud, with minimal bedding. Thirteen cores contained clasts (Fig. 9) within the reddish brown mud matrix indicating proximity to Unit M's base. We found virtually no macrofossils and did not find any articulated fossils in life positions and therefore did not date any samples. Pore water content generally ranged from 60% to 25% from the surface to the bottom of the cores. LOI values ranged from 3.5% to 10%.
4.1.7 Natural gas (NG) 
Acoustically opaque wipe-out curtains occur throughout Holocene sediments in all three estuaries. This unit obscures deeper reflections and is interpreted to be due to gas in the sediments. Although gascharged sediments challenge resolution of deeper units, in Belfast Bay and Passamaquoddy Bay such acoustically opaque curtains are interspersedwith unblanked reflections (Fig. 7). Thesewindows of transmission, on the order of tens of meters, typically coincide with pockmarks, and allowed us tomap sediment thickness in these two estuaries.Within Belfast and Passamaquoddy Bays gas typically coincides with Holocene sediments >16 m in thickness (Fig. 5). Other indications of gas in sediments, such as acoustically disrupted columns, or ※chimneys§ (sensu Cathles et al., 2010), were not observed in any of the estuaries. 
While collecting core PBVC-08-11 we witnessed bubbling at the sea surface. This core sampled the center of a pockmark underlain by gas (Fig. 5 for location). The deepest segment of the core shows extensive cracking. We interpret the cracks as evidence of gas expansion following Barnhardt et al. (1997, their Figure 10), who describe similar habit in cores from Belfast Bay.
4.2 Pockmarks spatial distribution and subsurface characteristics 
Pockmarks in this study occur between ?10 and ?108 m water depths. Their frequency and size varied among embayments (Table 3). Because pockmarks in Belfast Bay have a consistent depth-to-diameter ratio (Andrews et al., 2010) we use the depth of a pockmark's base below the background seafloor as an indication of its size. In Passamaquoddy Bay pockmarks are the most numerous (4515), smallest (mean depth below seafloor=3.6 m), and vary the least in size (standard deviation ㊣2.6 m). Blue Hill Bay hosted the largest pockmarks (mean depth below seafloor=12 m) with the greatest standard deviation (㊣8 m). Belfast Bay has the greatest concentration of pockmarks per area (46.5 pm/km2), and has size characteristics in between the other two bays. In all three embayments pockmarks are circular close to shore, but become elongated farther offshore, or in thalwegs (Fig. 2b). In one example, the seafloor in southern Belfast Bay terminates in flute-like structures, 50每150 m wide, 2每4 km long and 15每60 m deep (Fig. 1). Nearest neighbor analysis, the ratio of where features are expected to occur relative to where they actually occur, indicates that pockmarks are non-randomly distributed in all three fields (Table 4). This means that the pockmark's spatial distribution departs significantly from complete spatial randomness, implying that pockmark occurrence depends upon some factor(s).
Where sediment thickness could be mapped, pockmarks were identified only in areas with Holocene sediment thickness >2 m. Holocene sediment thickness strongly relates to pockmark size (Fig. 10). Larger pockmarks occur in thicker deposits while smaller pockmarks are in thinner deposits. Point-density analysis reveals that in Belfast and Passamaquoddy Bays the densest clustering of pockmarks occurs in Holocene sediments b15 m thick. Pockmark chains in Belfast and Passamaquoddy Bays consisting of large pockmarks (>100 mdiameter) coincidewith abrupt changes in depth of the unconformity (Figs. 11 and 12). Chains of small pockmarks outline glacial deposits (Fig. 13).
5.DISCUSSION 
5.1 Depositional and Erosional History 
The study area's nearshore stratigraphy reflects the regional glacial and local sea-level history (Barnhardt et al., 1997; Belknap et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2010). Late Wisconsinan glacial retreat from the Maine coast, between 15 and 13 ka (Dorion et al., 2001), was accompanied by marine incursion. During retreat, glaciers left heterogeneous deposits of till and glacial outwash (Unit T) across the seafloor (Belknap and Shipp, 1991; Kelley and Belknap, 1991). Glacial-marine muddy sediments (Unit GM) then blanketed these coarse-grained deposits. By 12.5 cal. ka further ice retreat and associated isostatic uplift caused relative sea-level fall to the lowstand of approximately 60 m below present-day level (Barnhardt et al., 1995). After the lowstand, sea level rose at varying rates (Kelley et al., 2010) leaving an eroded surface (U) along most of the region (Shipp et al., 1991). Since submergence, estuarine mud has accumulated over the transgressive surface (Unit M).
Within this study we identified acoustic Unit B only in Belfast Bay. Further, the unit has not been identified elsewhere in regional seismic surveys. This could reflect the unit's origins, or, less likely, could relate to the different seismic sources used (Table 2). Unit B's placement above the unconformity indicates that the unit was deposited during the Holocene. The unit's occurrence in the periphery of Belfast Bay suggests that Unit B formed around the estuary during lower sea level, perhaps as a marsh or eroded bluff toe deposit (e.g., Belknap et al., 2002). Due to the unit's depth within the sediment column we were unable to sample it using vibracores. Unit B's patchy distribution along the edge of Belfast Bay and absence in Blue Hill and Passamaquoddy Bays suggest that it is not related to pockmarks.
5.2 Pockmark Field Paleogeography since the Late Pleistocene and Shallow gas origins 
Though mottled glacial-marine sediments were logged previously in the region (e.g., Ostericher, 1965; Shipp, 1989; Barnhardt, 1994; Gontz, 2005), their significancewas uncertain because of the paucity of samples. We consistently recoveredmottled features at the basal unconformity in Belfast Bay's periphery (Fig. 8). Based on color, composition and texture, we identify these induratedmudclasts and softmasses as redoximorphic features. Diagnostic of hydric (wetland) soils, the development of redoximorphic features requires saturation, respiring bacteria, and an adequate supply of decomposable organic carbon (Vepraskas, 2001). Redoximorphic features form by reduction, translocation, and oxidation of Fe and Mn oxides (Vepraskas, 1994; New England Hydric Soils Technical Committee (NEHSTC), 1998). Within a soil profile, redoximorphic features occur directly under the uppermost soil horizons, O or A, richest in organic material (NEHSTC, 1998) (Fig. 14). Our cores did not sample any organic-rich (>10% LOI) horizons.
The distribution of redoximorphic features confirms that wetlands occurred throughout Belfast Bay at a period of lower relative sea level. The features' coincidence with the Holocene/Pleistocene unconformity and the absence of the upper organic horizons in core samples strongly suggest that the upper organic horizons of the paleosol eroded during transgression (Fig. 14). The consequent unconformity was then buried with Holocene-age nearshore detrital sediments (Unit M).
Rogers et al. (2006) suggested that a buried, terrestrial, organic-rich layer, such as a peat (LOI ~60%), evolved into methane, and, by inference, formed regional pockmarks.We found no evidence for such a layer. Further, a concentrated organic deposit is not necessary to generatemethane in this setting. According to Rice (1992), total organic content (TOC) in excess of 0.5% is sufficient to induce methanogenesis in sediments. LOI values, an estimate of TOC, measured in Unit M are at least an order of magnitude greater than that threshold. Because there is no evidence for a buried, organic-rich Pleistocene-age deposit, and the organic content of UnitMis sufficient to fostermethane generation, we conclude that Holocene estuarine sediments are the stratigraphic source of shallow gas in Belfast Bay, and likely the other study sites.
5.3 Pockmarks' relation to stratigraphy 
Pockmarks occur solely in the Holocene sediment package, with the bases of pockmarks not extending below the Holocene/Pleistocene unconformity. We interpret this confinement as evidence that pockmarks formed during the Holocene from the expulsion of gas generated in estuarine sediments. Our spatial analysis indicates that variation in Holocene sediment thickness, reflecting the region's irregular underlying topography, influences pockmark size and distribution (Figs. 10 and 15). Deep pockmarks coincide with areas of thick Holocene sediment, while shallow pockmarks occur in areas of minimal Holocene sediment accumulation. Based on this relationship we hypothesize that size differences between pockmarks in the three embayments (Table 3) reflect Holocene sediment thickness (i.e., Blue Hill Bay has the thickest sediments and thus the largest pockmarks, Passamaquoddy Bay has the thinnest sediments and thus the smallest pockmarks). The absence of shallow pockmarks in thicker sediments may reflect the propensity for pockmark collapse, amalgamation, or erosion in thick deposits; or alternatively, such size sorting may indicate different consequences of fluid flow in thin and thick sediment packages, such as the development of more integrated pathways of gas flow in thicker units.
Chains of pockmarks also relate to the Holocene sediment package and are quasi-normal to the steepest gradient in Holocene sediment thickness. Variation in Holocene sediment thickness likely creates a pressure gradient, enabling gas migration from zones where the overburden pressure is greatest (thickest sediment) to zones of minimal overburden pressure (thin sediments). In Belfast Bay and Passamaquoddy Bay, pockmark chains occur at the abrupt thinning of Holocene sediment related to antecedent geology, glacial deposits and paleochannels. Hovland et al. (2002) noted that pockmark chains often nucleate along zones of weakness where fluid flow focuses. The tens of meters of relief over a relatively short horizontal difference (e.g., 200 m) that typifies the regions' underlying topography may set up conditions for focused fluid expulsion capable of forming pockmarks. Pinet et al. (2010), and Lavoie et al. (2010) have also noted a relationship between pockmarks and the underlying bedrock and topography of the St. Lawrence estuary.
We note that not all muddy, gassy estuaries underlain by irregular topography have pockmarks. For example, paleochannels similar in relief to the underlying topography of north temperate estuaries underlie Chesapeake Bay, yet the bay lacks pockmarks. Differences in seafloor morphology may result from the permeability of sediments that infill topographic lows. In Chesapeake Bay the lower channel-fill unit of each paleochannel is a fluvial deposit, typically made of coarse sand and fine gravel (Coleman et al., 1990). This is in stark contrast to the homogenous, cohesive fine-grained estuarine sediment that fills the nearshore basins in the north temperate pockmark fields. Coarser-grained channel fill could promote fluidmigration and diffusion along the channel, rather than vertical migration of fluids that occurs in fine-grained sediment (e.g., Jain and Juanes, 2009; Scandella et al., 2011), resulting in gas spatially coincident with paleochannels and minimal seafloor disturbance (Hill et al., 1992). 
Within the three temperate embayments, pockmarks do not persist seaward of the 70 meter isobath. In seaward portions of all three embayments pockmark morphology alters from circular to comet-like features terminating in elongate scours related to increased nearbed uni-directional flow (Fig. 2b) (e.g., Brothers et al., 2011b). In Belfast and Blue Hill Bays, nearbed currents within thalwegs are likely 1.2每1.7 times faster than the velocities in the upper bay, using continuity of water volume where Uc is channel velocity, Ub is basin velocity, Dc is channel depth, Db is basin depth, Wc is channel width, and Wb is basin width.
In semi-enclosed bodies of seawater, it is possible that the protection of bedrock, or till headlands, is required to preserve pockmark morphology. Enhanced offshore nearbed currents may limit the seaward extent of the estuarine pockmark field. In addition, the pockmarks may not continue offshore due to the diminution in Holocene sediment thickness, but more extensive seismic coverage is necessary to confirm this. The factors that appear to control pockmark distribution in the examined temperate estuaries may also explain pockmark distribution in other structurally-controlled coastal settings such as fjords, or Rias (Iglesias and Garcia-Gil, 2007;Webb et al., 2009).
6.CONCLUSION 
We conclude that a terrestrial deposit high in organic content is not the source for gas responsible for pockmarks. Instead, our data analysis suggests that sediments deposited in the last 11,000 years fostered the gas related to the pockmarks. Holocene sediment thickness, dictated by available accommodation space, exhibits control on pockmark size and distribution. Our findings indicate that variation in Holocene sediment thickness made possible by irregular underlying topography may ultimately play a more important role in temperate estuarine pockmark distribution than drowned terrestrial deposits.
