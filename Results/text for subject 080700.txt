electric simulations is given in the supplementary section of this
study. After validating the numerical model on the single TE
module, we extended the simulation for multiple modules based
on the geometry of an oil pan as described in the next section.
Bismuth telluride (Bi Te ) was selected as the TE material in the
2 3
simulations. The material properties (i.e. Seebeck coefﬁcient, elec-
trical conductivity and, thermal conductivity) were input as
boundary conditions and estimated at the average temperature of
hot and cold surfaces as shown inTable 1.
Poweroutputwascalculatedfrom(Eq.(6))fordifferentexternal

mined at temperature gradient for hot and cold surfaces. The
maximum power was achieved when the external resistance
became identical to the internal resistance of the thermoelectric
system between metal and a p-n type element.

3.3. Energy harvesting in larger sized oil pans
Oil pans of large duty heavy engines are also considered to
determine the effect of oil pan size onTE power generation in this
study. Increase of the surface area results in generating more
output power due to the larger number of TE modules that can be
ﬁttedintotheoil pan.Thesurfaceareaof theoilpanforlargeduty

nozzle setup where air can be forced through the nozzle channel
toward the bottom surface of the oil pan which increases the air

Increased air velocity results in reduction in the bottomwall tem-

power.

A numerical model for transport in ﬂat heat pipes considering wick microstructure effects

Abstract:
A transient, three-dimensional model for thermal transport in heat pipes and vapor chambers is developed. The Navier–Stokes equations along with the energy equation are solved numerically for the liquid and vapor ﬂows. A porous medium formulation is used for the wick region. Evaporation and condensation at the liquid–vapor interface are modeled using kinetic theory. The inﬂuence of the wick microstructure on evaporation and condensation mass ﬂuxes at the liquid–vapor interface is accounted for by integrating a microstructure-level evaporation model (micromodel) with the device-level model (macromodel). Meniscus curvature at every location along the wick is calculated as a result of this coupling. The model accounts for the change in interfacial area in the wick pore, thin-ﬁlm evaporation, and Marangoni convection effects during phase change at the liquid–vapor interface. The coupled model is used to predict the performance of a heat pipe with a screen-mesh wick, and the implications of the coupling employed are discussed.

1.Introduction:
Miniature heat pipes and vapor chambers effectively spread and carry heat from a heat-dissipating microelectronic chip to a remote location where air-cooling techniques may be deployed. These passive cooling devices transfer heat across a low temperature differential so that a safe working temperature for the chip can be maintained. As the size of electronic components continues to de-crease with a simultaneous increase in heat dissipation ﬂuxes, it is becoming increasingly necessary to optimize the shape and design of the heat spreaders for more efﬁcient thermal management. The maximum liquid feeding ﬂow rate that can be supported in a heat pipe wick due to capillary pressure (the capillary limit) restricts the maximum heat input that can be supported without causing dry-out. Improved heat pipe performance requires wick structures with superior wicking ability as well as enhanced thin-ﬁlm evaporation characteristics. In recent work, the authors [1,2] studied the wicking and evaporation characteristics of various microstructures to be used in heat pipes and concluded that sintered powder wicks have the best performance characteristics among those considered. However, models which predict the effects of various microstructures on the heat transfer performance of heat pipes have not, to our knowledge, been employed widely and are the focus of the present work.
Many numerical and analytical models have been developed to study the operation of heat pipes. Garimella and Sobhan [3] re-viewed the state of the art in the understanding and analysis of a large variety of heat pipes, and also identiﬁed the respective limitations. Modeling of heat pipes is complicated by the various mechanisms of heat, mass and momentum transport prevalent in the device, viz., the capillarity of the porous medium, evaporation/condensation in the wick structure, and conduction in the so-lid wall, among others. Models with approximate coupling between the various transport mechanisms have been developed and have led to fair predictions of heat pipe performance. In most of these cases, the wick structure has been assumed to be a continuous porous medium and the implications of micro-scale phenomena such as thin-ﬁlm evaporation and Marangoni convection in the wick pores have not been given much attention. As heat pipes and vapor chambers decrease in size, and surface-to-volume ratios increase, details of transport at the liquid–vapor interface may be-come increasingly important in determining heat pipe performance. Vadakkan et al. [4,5] developed a three-dimensional numerical model to study the performance of ﬂat heat pipes with multiple discrete heat sources. The effects of heat source strength and separation on steady as well as transient performance were studied. The wick–vapor interface was assumed to be ﬂat and local curvature effects were not considered. Ooijen and Hoogendoorn [6] presented a steady-state numerical analysis of the vapor core in a horizontal ﬂat heat pipe. Tournier and El-Genk [7] developed a two-dimensional model for the transient analysis of heat pipes. The analysis determined the radius of curvature of the liquid meniscus formed in the wick pores. Zhu and Vafai [8] studied the startup operating characteristics of asymmetrical ﬂat-plate and disk-shaped heat pipes using analytical models. Carbajal et al. [9] used a quasi-3D numerical analysis to obtain the temperature dis-tribution on the back side of a ﬂat heat pipe. They demonstrated that the ﬂat heat pipe led to a more uniform temperature distribution on the condenser side compared to a solid heat spreader. Koito et al. [10] developed a numerical model to solve the ﬂow and en-ergy equations in vapor chambers and estimated the capillary pressure head necessary to circulate the working ﬂuid inside the vapor chamber.
In a recent study, Do et al. [11] developed a mathematical mod-el for predicting the thermal performance of a ﬂat micro-heat pipe with a rectangular-grooved wick structure. They considered the effects of liquid–vapor interfacial shear stress and contact angle on device performance. Xiao and Faghri [12] developed a three-dimensional heat pipe model which accounted for heat conduction in the wall and ﬂuid ﬂow in the vapor core and porous wicks. Singh et al. [13] studied the effect of wick properties on the heat transfer characteristics of miniature loop heat pipes. Capillary structures with smaller pore size, high porosity, and high permeability showed better heat transfer characteristics in their experiments. Models [14–16] analyzing the performance of heat pipes with given wick structures have also been developed. Marangoni convection under large temperature differences was shown to have a signiﬁcant enhancement effect on heat transfer [17–19]. How-ever, the present authors [2] showed that Marangoni convection in the wick pores of heat pipes does not play a signiﬁcant role in enhancing the rate of evaporation heat transfer.
Most numerical models for predicting heat pipe performance do not consider the microstructure-scale ﬂow and heat transfer effects. Evaporation heat transfer from the thin liquid ﬁlm near the solid–liquid contact line of a liquid meniscus has been shown to account for more than 60% of the total heat transfer occurring from the meniscus [2,20]. In most conventional heat pipes and vapor chambers, the limiting thermal resistance is that of the wick, and the resistance due to the already efﬁcient evaporative heat transfer usually need not be considered. However, as device dimensions fall and wicks become thinner, liquid–vapor interface resistance may begin to play an increasingly important role in determining heat pipe performance. It is therefore important to develop heat pipe models which include the effects of microscale evaporation in wick pores on overall device performance.
Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic diagram of a ﬂat heat pipe. It consists of a solid copper wall, a porous wick structure (sintered powders in this case, and only present in this ﬁgure on the inside of the upper wall), and a vapor core. The evaporator and condenser regions are shown on the upper wall of heat pipe in this depiction. All other external surfaces are adiabatic. The liquid and vapor ﬂows shown in Fig. 1(a) complete the ﬂuid loop of heat pipe. Due to the high vapor pressure, a large capillary pressure is developed across the liquid–vapor interface in the wick pores of the evaporator section. The capillary pressure decreases towards the condenser section and the wet point condition (ﬂat interface) is reached at the end of the condenser section (with complete pressure recovery assumed in the vapor). The curvature of the liquid meniscus in the wick pores is determined by the interfacial capillary pressure. High capillary pressure in the evaporator section leads to higher interfacial curvature compared to the condenser region (as shown in the insets in Fig. 1(a)). The interface shape determines the extent of thin-ﬁlm meniscus formation in the wick pores, which in turn determines the interfacial resistance to heat transfer. In the present work, we have coupled a micro-scale wick-level model [21] with a macro-scale device-level model in order to capture the interface curvature effects in different microstructures. This will lead to a more accurate prediction of the effect of wick microstructure on the heat pipe performance.

2. Model description：
In the present work, a device-level numerical model (macro-model) is utilized to compute the ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds in a ﬂat heat pipe, also known as a vapor chamber. The macro-model solves for the continuity, momentum and energy equations in the solid wall, wick and vapor regions of the heat pipe. The wick-vapor interface is numerically modeled as a ﬂat interface while the wick structure is treated as a porous medium. The macro-model does not account for the curvature of the liquid meniscus formed inside the wick pores and thus ignores micro-scale details of thin-ﬁlm evaporation and Marangoni convection occurring during the evaporation process. To capture these micro-scale evaporation effects, a micro-model [21] which computes the evaporation of liquid in wick microstructures is coupled with the macro-model. Details of the two models and the algorithm used for coupling the two are now presented.

2.1. Device-level macro-model：
The device-level macro-model employed here is adapted from the work of Vadakkan et al. [4,5]. An equilibrium model for heat transfer and a Brinkman–Forchheimer extended Darcy model are employed for ﬂuid ﬂow in the wick. The transient change in vapor density due to pressurization is calculated using the ideal gas state equation. The vapor ﬂow is assumed to be laminar and incompressible. The phase-change mass ﬂow rate due to evaporation/condensation, and the temperature and pressure at the liquid–va-por interface are determined using an energy balance at the inter-face in conjunction with kinetic theory and the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. The energy balance at the interface includes convection and conduction on the liquid and vapor sides. The vapor ﬂow, and the temperature and hydrodynamic pressure ﬁelds are computed from coupled continuity/momentum and energy equations in the vapor and wick regions, and a conduction analysis in the wall. The model assumes that the wick is saturated with liquid throughout, which is required to prevent dryout.
To accommodate transient changes in the vapor and liquid mass under the assumption of a liquid-saturated wick, the volume-aver-aged density of the liquid is modiﬁed based on the mass balance. The model assumes all thermophysical properties to be constant except for the vapor density, which is found from the operating pressure Pop and the local temperature using the perfect gas law.

2.1.1. Governing equations and boundary conditions: macro-model：
Under the assumptions discussed above, the generalized governing equations for the wick and vapor regions may be written as shown below. The continuity equation for the wick and the va-por core is The above expression has been obtained with the assumption that the mean evaporation coefﬁcient is equal to the mean condensation coefﬁcient, where their variation with temperature and pressure may be assumed to be small [23]. The value of accommo-
dation coefﬁcient ^r in the above expression for evaporation mass transfer rate has been observed to vary over four orders of magni-tude, as described in [24]. A value of unity for the accommodation coefﬁcient has been widely used [25–27]. However, experimentally obtained accommodation coefﬁcients have been smaller due to contamination of the surface. The accommodation coefﬁcient has also been shown in experiments to depend on temperature [28,29] and vapor pressure [30]. Badam et al. [30] reported the accommodation coefﬁcient of water to be in the range of 0.028–0.15, which was deduced from evaporation experiments per-formed on water with the vapor pressure kept below 1200 Pa. Rose [31] reviewed the value of the accommodation coefﬁcient of water and suggested that its value lies in the range of 0.5–1. The value chosen for accommodation coefﬁcient determines the thermal resistance offered by the liquid–vapor interface in a vapor chamber, and it is critical that this value be determined carefully via experiments. Owing to the fact that the thermal performance of a vapor chamber may be greatly affected by the chosen value of
^r, we present our analysis for two values of ^r, viz., 0.03 and 1, to bracket the performance. The evaporated and condensed mass is assumed to ﬂow normal to the interface when accounting for transport due to evaporation/condensation.

2.1.2. Computation of operating pressure in vapor core：
Under the incompressible ﬂow assumption, hydrodynamic pressure differences are small as compared to the absolute operating pressure in the domain. To prevent round-off in the hydrodynamic pressure gradient computation, and to allow for system pressurization under the incompressible assumption, the pressure is split into two components: Additional details of the numerical method are available in [4,5]. The governing equations are solved in their transient form using the commercial CFD solver FLUENT [33]. A transient computation of the governing equations is necessary to set the level of pressure in the vapor domain. A steady, incompressible ﬂow calculation with all-velocity boundary conditions does not allow the pressure level to be determined uniquely since only the gradient of pressure appears in the governing equations. The pressure level is rendered unique by initial conditions; the speciﬁcation of the initial mass allows the pressure to be determined uniquely at each time step. It should be emphasized that this is not an artifact of the numerical scheme, but is a property of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. A detailed discussion of these issues can be found in previous work by the authors [4,5]. Suitable user-deﬁned functions (UDFs) have been developed to compute the evaporation/condensation mass ﬂow rates, temperature and pressure at the wick–vapor interface, as well as the liquid and vapor densities at every time step. The attainment of steady state is identiﬁed in this work as the time at which the heat transfer rate on the condenser side reaches within 2% of the value at the evaporator.

2.2. Wick-level micro-model：
The wick-level micro-model computes the evaporation heat transfer rate from the liquid meniscus formed in the pores of common wick structures used in heat pipes. The model considers only the top layer of wick pores, where the liquid meniscus is formed. Details of this model are available in Ranjan et al. [2,21]. An idealized two-dimensional representation of screen mesh wick struc-ture, viz., parallel horizontal wires for screen mesh wick, is used. The model assumes a static shape for the liquid meniscus formed inside wick pores. Static liquid meniscus shapes in the given wick geometries are obtained using the program Surface Evolver [34]. Surface Evolver computes the total surface energy of a given system and the equilibrium minimum energy conﬁguration is obtained by a gradient descent method. Details of this method can be found in [1]. With known curvature of the liquid meniscus in the wick pores, the capillary pressure generated by the wick structure (for a given wick porosity, length scale and solid–liquid con-tact angle) is also determined using the Young–Laplace equation. It should be noted that the meniscus level in the wick pore has been assumed to be equivalent to the radius of the wires in the present work. As presented in [1,2], this meniscus level leads to the highest capillary pressure generation in the wick pore; the evaporative heat transfer rate, on the other hand, was found to be unaffected by a change in the meniscus level. For future reference, this model is referred to as the static-meniscus micro-model.
Fig. 1(b) shows the equilibrium shape of a liquid meniscus formed between parallel horizontal wires (idealized representation for screen mesh wick; only top layer is shown here). The solid–li-quid contact angle is assumed to be 30, the porosity is 0.56, and the non-dimensional radius (radius taken as the length scale) of the wires is 1.The static liquid meniscus shapes thus computed are exported from Surface Evolver to GAMBIT [33] and the domain is discretized for ﬁnite volume computations in FLUENT [33]. It is noted that the assumption of a static meniscus shape under evaporative conditions would be valid for the very small Weber and Capillary numbers encountered in this work as is veriﬁed using simulations. The FLUENT model is used to compute ﬂow and heat transfer in the microstructure. This model is referred to as the wick-level micro-model. The mathematical formulation for modeling evaporation in wick structures is now presented.
2.2.1. Governing equations and boundary conditions: wick-level micro-model：
Fig. 1(c) shows the computational domain used for modeling evaporation from the liquid meniscus in wick microstructures. A unit cell representing the wick topology is modeled. Incompressible, laminar and steady ﬂow of water with constant properties is assumed in the liquid domain. The vapor is assumed to be saturated at a given temperature, as in an operating heat pipe. The wick-level micro-model is utilized only to correct the phase change mass ﬂow rates (Eq. (9)) at the wick–vapor interface in the macro-model. The vapor domain is not modeled since the absolute mass ﬂow rates in the heat pipe are not computed from the micro-model. The following continuity, momentum and energy equations are solved:
The boundary conditions for the case of a 2D meniscus between horizontal wires are shown in Fig. 1(c). The incoming liquid is assumed to be at a constant temperature, Tinlet, with a given pressure inlet boundary condition. A constant temperature boundary condition is applied at the bottom solid wall. A convective heat transfer boundary condition is imposed on the non-wetted portion of the so-lid particles exposed to vapor, labeled top wall in Fig. 1(c). The value of the natural convection coefﬁcient hnat from the surface of spheres and long wires is given by the Nusselt number correlation presented in [35]. The liquid–vapor interface is modeled as a ﬁxed interface with a convective boundary condition. To promote numerical stability, the heat transfer due to evaporation is implemented through an equivalent convective heat transfer coefﬁcient, hevap, which is obtained using the evaporative mass ﬂux expression (Eq. (9)), so that:
Evaporation from the liquid–vapor interface is modeled under the assumption of saturated vapor conditions, simulating heat pipe operation. The evaporative mass ﬂux at the interface is obtained according to Schrage [22] and is given by Eq. (9). Two values for
^r, 0.03 and 1.0 are used in the micro-model computations as mentioned earlier. Mass transport due to evaporation at the liquid–va-por interface is implemented by imposing mass sink terms in the liquid cells adjacent to the interface.
Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the temperature and ﬂow ﬁelds inside the wick pore for a meniscus between parallel horizontal wires, for
^r ¼ 0:03 and 1, respectively. The vapor is assumed to be saturated at 298 K. Standard thermophysical properties of water at 298 K are used in these simulations. The liquid–vapor interface is seen to be at the minimum temperature in the whole domain due to evapora-tion heat transfer. Non-uniformity in the meniscus thickness leads to differential evaporation rates, and consequently, a temperature gradient along the interface. This leads to the formation of two counter-rotating Marangoni vortices in the liquid domain. Evapo-rative mass ﬂux on the interface (Eq. (9)), from the solid–liquid contact line to the center of meniscus, is plotted in Fig. 2(c) for the two values of accommodation coefﬁcient. The evaporative mass ﬂux for ^r ¼ 0:03 is smaller than for ^r ¼ 1 by more than an order of magnitude. Also, for ^r ¼ 1, the evaporative mass ﬂux de-creases sharply to zero from the thin-ﬁlm region towards the central meniscus. From the detailed results in [2,21] obtained using ^r ¼ 1, thin-ﬁlm evaporation occurring near the solid–liquid contact line was found to account for more than 80% of the total evaporation from the interface. However, for ^r ¼ 0:03, it is seen
in Fig. 2(c) that the evaporative mass ﬂux decreases gradually from the contact line thin-ﬁlm region towards the central region. The contribution of the thin-ﬁlm region itself to the total evaporation from meniscus is insigniﬁcant for ^r ¼ 0:03. The authors previously
[2,21] showed that Marangoni convection is insigniﬁcant in enhancing evaporation in wick pores, and therefore, heat transfer at this scale is determined to ﬁrst order by thermal conduction.
The effects of changing the value of accommodation coefﬁcient on the rate of evaporation and the evaporation heat transfer coefﬁcient (as deﬁned in Eq. (26)) are considered further by simulating the evaporation of water from a liquid pool, using the wick-level micro-model. The domain for this problem is shown in Fig. 3(a), in which the vapor domain is assumed to be saturated at 298 K. Fig. 3(b) shows the variation of evaporation rate and evaporative
heat transfer coefﬁcient with ^r. With an increase in ^r from 0.18 to 1.6, the evaporative heat transfer coefﬁcient increases from 8.3 􀀁 104 W/m2 K to 3.32 􀀁 106 W/m2 K. However, the evaporation rate (ml) increases with an increase in ^r from 0.18 to 0.5, but be-comes independent of the value of ^r with further increases in ^r. This shows that for higher values of ^rð> 0:5Þ, the rate of evaporation is determined by the conduction heat transfer across the liquid pool (from inlet to the vapor domain) and the liquid–vapor inter-face resistance for heat transfer becomes negligible.

2.3. Coupling of macro- and micro-models：
The static-meniscus and wick-level micro-models described in the previous section are coupled with the device-level macro-mod-el in order to incorporate the effect of different microstructures on heat pipe performance. The macro-model does not account for the liquid–vapor interface shape in the wick pores, thin-ﬁlm evaporation or Marangoni convection. However, it has been noted [2,21] that thin-ﬁlm evaporation effects are critical for predicting the evaporative mass ﬂow rate correctly. Coupling the micro-models with the macro-model captures the micro-level aspects of evaporation from the liquid–vapor interface and examines the importance of the liquid–vapor interface in determining the device performance for given conditions. The algorithm for coupling the two types of models is now presented.
For a given heat input to the heat pipe, the local liquid–vapor interface shape is determined by the balance of surface tension The ratios of evaporative mass ﬂuxes in the wick pore for ^r ¼ 0:03 and 1.0 are obtained as a function of the solid–liquid con-
tact angle and wick porosity. The vapor temperature and solid wall superheat (see Tbot in Fig. 1(c)) are also varied to determine their effect on the mass ﬂux ratio. The mass ﬂux ratio changes by less than 5% for a 7 K variation in vapor temperature and a 15 K varia-tion in solid superheat, showing that the mass ﬂux ratio may be as-sumed to be unaffected by the vapor temperature and superheat. Variations of the mass ﬂux ratio with contact angle for various wick porosities are shown in Fig. 6(b) and (c) for ^r ¼ 0:03 and 1.0,
respectively. The mass ﬂux ratio is always greater than 1; this is due to the formation of a thin-ﬁlm meniscus at the solid–liquid contact line, and to a lesser extent, enhanced convection effects. The mass ﬂux ratio decreases with increasing contact angle and porosity. This is because the thin-ﬁlm area of the meniscus in a wick pore decreases with increase in contact angle and porosity. It can also be observed that the mass ﬂux correction ratios are
much greater for ^r ¼ 1 as compared to those for ^r ¼ 0:03. As it was discussed earlier (refer to the discussion regarding Fig. 2(c)), thin-ﬁlm evaporation effects near the solid–liquid contact line are more pronounced for ^r ¼ 1. This leads to higher mass ﬂux cor-rections for ^r ¼ 1 as compared to r^ ¼ 0:03. The following correla-tions are obtained for the mass ﬂux ratios as functions of contact angle (in degrees) for a porosity = 0.56 using the least-squares curve-ﬁt feature of MATLAB [36]:
Step 5: Correct the local evaporative mass ﬂow rate at the liquid–vapor interface in the macro-model using area and mass ﬂux ratios. Using the capillary pressure at the point of interest on the inter-face, the local contact angle h is ﬁrst computed using Eq. (30). Once h is known, the area and mass ﬂux corrections are computed from Eqs. (32)–(34), and the local evaporation mass ﬂow rates in the heat pipe macro-model are corrected using Eq. (31). The correc-tions are also employed in the calculation of interface temperature (Eq. (7)), and the computation of system pressure (Eq. (18)). This process is repeated during every iteration of the macro-model sim-ulation until convergence is obtained.

3. Results and discussion：
Simulation results for a 2D vapor chamber (as shown in Fig. 7(a)) using the device-level macro-model and coupled micro–macro models are presented in this section. The tempera-ture and ﬂow ﬁelds in the vapor chamber, as predicted by the macro-model, for given input heat ﬂux and condenser side condi-tions are discussed for two values of the accommodation coefﬁ-
cient, ^r ¼ 0:03 and 1. This is followed by the implications of using the micro–macro coupled model for the prediction of device performance under a given set of conditions. A smaller vapor chamber with a thinner wick structure and higher wick thermal conductivity, is discussed next in order to examine the role of the liquid–vapor interface on the performance of vapor chambers as they are miniaturized.

3.1. Description of vapor chamber under study：
A schematic diagram of a 2D ﬂat vapor chamber modeled in the present work is shown in Fig. 7(a). It incorporates a 5 mm wide evaporator region at the center of its top surface while the entire lower surface is the condenser region. A screen mesh is assumed for the wick. The vapor chamber has a height of 3 mm and a length of 30 mm. A solid wall thickness of 0.25 mm, a wick thickness of 0.2 mm and a vapor core thickness of 2.1 mm are chosen. All sur-faces other than the evaporator and condenser regions are mod-eled as adiabatic solid walls. The wall and wick are made of copper and the working ﬂuid is water. The porosity, permeability and thermal conductivity of the sintered screen mesh wick are 0.56, 2.97 􀀁 10􀀂11 m2, and 40 W/m K, respectively. Ergun’s coefﬁ-cient, CE, is taken to be 0.55. The radius of the wires in the screen mesh is assumed to be 100 lm. The wick is present on all sides of the vapor chamber. The heating and cooling boundary condi-tions are applied on opposite sides of the chamber. An input heat ﬂux of 10 W/cm2 is applied at the evaporator region of the heat pipe, leading to a heat input of 500 W/m. Standard thermophysical properties for water and copper at 298 K are utilized. The thermo-physical properties of the vapor chamber material and working ﬂuid are tabulated in Table 1. The coolant water temperature and the heat transfer coefﬁcient on the condenser are 298 K and 400 W/m2 K, respectively. The initial temperature of the heat pipe is 298 K and the vapor is assumed to be saturated.

3.2. Flow and temperature ﬁelds inside the vapor chamber：
Fig. 7(b)–(g) shows the temperature and ﬂow ﬁelds in the vapor chamber, predicted by the macro-model for ^r ¼ 1 and 0.03. The temperature drops across the vapor chamber for ^r ¼ 1 and 0.03 are 0.73 and 1.62 K, respectively. For the smaller value of the accommodation coefﬁcient, the thermal resistance of the liquid–vapor interface inside the vapor chamber is signiﬁcant, thus lead-ing to a higher thermal resistance of the vapor chamber. Fig. 7(b) and (c) shows the temperature contours in the vapor chamber. The working liquid evaporates at the liquid–vapor interface below the evaporator region of the vapor chamber and the vapor con-denses on the lower liquid–vapor interface. Fig. 7(d) and (e) shows Darcian approach appropriate in the wick medium. The liquid pres-
sure drops are found to be 323 and 320 Pa for ^r ¼ 1 and 0.03, respectively. The steady-state operating pressure of the heat pipe
is 31.9 and 32.1 kPa for ^r ¼ 1 and 0.03, respectively.
Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows the temperature values on the outer walls of the vapor chamber for the two values of accommodation coefﬁcient. The temperature is highest at the center of the evapo-rator region while that on the condenser side is uniform, as desired for a vapor chamber heat spreader. The predicted temperature drops show that the thermal resistance offered by the vapor cham-
ber is 1.46 􀀁 10􀀂3 K/W and 3.24 􀀁 10􀀂3 K/W for ^r ¼ 1 and 0.03, respectively. The evaporation/condensation mass ﬂuxes are plot-ted along the liquid–vapor interfaces on the evaporator and con-
denser sides of the vapor chamber in Fig. 8(c) and (d) for r^ ¼ 1 and 0.03, respectively. It is seen that the working ﬂuid evaporates from the upper liquid–vapor interface over a region approximately 1 cm long, which is twice the size of the evaporator heat input area. The vapor condenses uniformly over the liquid–vapor interface on the condenser side.

3.3. Effects of micro- and macro-model coupling：
Steady-state results from the micro–macro coupled heat pipe model are presented for the 2D vapor chamber in Fig. 7(a). The va-por chamber material, working ﬂuid properties and the thermal boundary conditions used are the same as those considered in the macromodel in the previous section. The thermal performance of the vapor chamber for both values of accommodation coefﬁcient is predicted with the coupled model and the results compared to the uncoupled macromodel.
The coupling of the micro–macro models is implemented by the means of correcting the interface mass ﬂow rates and the interfa-cial area based on the interfacial capillary pressure drop inside the vapor chamber. Fig. 9(a) and (b) presents the interfacial pressure drop and the local contact angle along the liquid–vapor interface in the vapor chamber for ^r ¼ 1 and 0.03, respectively. Points 1,
2, 3 and 4 correspond to different locations on the liquid–vapor interface in the vapor chamber, as marked in Fig. 7(a). The wet point is assumed to be at the center of the condenser region (at location 3) in the vapor chamber. The liquid pressure in the wick is highest at this location, as it would be at the end of the con-denser section in a cylindrical heat pipe. The interfacial capillary
pressure drop (318 Pa for ^r ¼ 1 and 317 Pa ^r ¼ 0:03) is highest at the center of the evaporator section, leading to the highest cur-
vature and smallest contact angle (69.9 for ^r ¼ 1 and 70 ^r ¼ 0:03) at this location. The contact angle increases from 69.9 in the evaporator section to 90 in the center of the condenser re-gion (i.e., at the wet point).
Fig. 9(c) and (d) shows the mass ﬂux correction, area correction and mass ﬂow rate correction ratios along the liquid–vapor inter-
face in the vapor chamber for ^r ¼ 1 and 0.03, respectively. The area correction ratio is predicted using Eq. (32) while the mass correc-tion ratios can be computed using Eqs. (33) and (34) for the two values of accommodation coefﬁcient. As can be observed from the ﬁgures, the corrections in interface area and mass ﬂow rate are highest at the point of highest curvature and lowest contact an-gle, i.e., the center of the evaporator region (point 1). The correc-tions become smaller as the condenser section is approached since the meniscus curvature in the wick pore decreases from the evaporator center towards the center of the condenser region. Mass ﬂux correction ratios are higher for ^r ¼ 1 as compared to those for ^r ¼ 0:03. The total correction ratio is the product of area and mass ﬂux correction ratios and it shows a similar variation as the mass ﬂux correction ratio along the liquid–vapor interface in
the vapor chamber. For ^r ¼ 1, the total correction ratio is greater than 1 leading to an enhancement in the evaporation/condensation
rates in the vapor chamber. For ^r ¼ 0:03, the total correction ratio is smaller than 1, thus reducing the rate of evaporation/condensa-tion inside the chamber. With a decrease in the phase change rates, it is expected that the thermal resistance of the vapor chamber will increase when a working ﬂuid with very small accommodation coefﬁcient is used in the vapor chamber.
A comparison between the non-coupled and coupled models is now presented. For ^r ¼ 1, as presented in Fig. 9(c), the mass ﬂow
rate correction ratios are greater than 1 (in the range of 1.4–1.6). This leads to an increase in the evaporation/condensation heat transfer coefﬁcient at the liquid–vapor interface, thus reducing the thermal resistance offered by the interface in the device. How-ever, as discussed at the end of Section 2.2.1, the rate of evapora-tion from a liquid meniscus will be only slightly affected if the
evaporation heat transfer coefﬁcient is enhanced when r^ > 0:5. A similar observation is made by comparing the temperature drops across the vapor chamber from the non-coupled and coupled mod-els. The non-coupled model predicts the temperature drop across the vapor chamber to be 0.72 K while the coupled model predicts it to be 0.7 K (􀀄3% decrease in the temperature drop). However,
for ^r ¼ 0:03, the temperature drop predicted by the coupled model is 1.92 K, while the non-coupled model predicts a temperature drop of 1.62 K. The temperature drop predicted by the coupled model is 􀀄16% higher than that from the non-coupled model. The increase in thermal resistance can be explained on the basis of the mass ﬂow rate correction ratios being smaller than 1 for ^r ¼ 0:03, as presented in Fig. 9(d). Hence, the coupled model incor-
porates the increase in the thermal resistance of the vapor cham-ber by accounting for the liquid–vapor interface thermal resistance in the vapor chamber. With the coupled model, the stea-dy-state operating pressure of the vapor chamber decreases from
31.9 kPa (non-coupled model) to 31.8 kPa for ^r ¼ 1. This is due to the decrease in the working temperature of the vapor chamber.
However, for ^r ¼ 0:03, the working temperature of the vapor
chamber increases as a result of coupling and so, the coupled mod-el predicts the operating pressure to be 32.2 kPa (32.1 kPa pre-dicted by the non-coupled model).
Fig. 10(a) and (b) shows the temperature contours in the vapor chamber and the temperature values on the outer surfaces of the vapor chamber, as predicted by the coupled model for ^r ¼ 0:03.
3.3.1. Vapor chamber with a thinner, higher-conductivity wick：
As discussed above, the coupling of the wick-level micro-model with the device-level macro-model leads to an accurate assessment of the role of the liquid–vapor interface inside the vapor chamber for determining its spreading behavior, i.e., the thermal perfor-mance. It is shown that the coupling is important for accurate predictions in the case of working ﬂuids with small accommodation coefﬁcients. From a ﬁrst-order approximation, it can be shown that the liquid–vapor interface thermal resistance (􀀄1/hevapAi) is equiv-alent to that offered by the wick structure itself (􀀄wick thickness/(kwickAi)) when the wick thickness is 40 lm (calculated with hevap =106 W/m2 K for r^ ¼ 1, kwick = 40 W/m K). hevap is much smal-ler (􀀄104 W/m2 K) for ^r ¼ 0:03 and so the interface thermal resis-tance becomes signiﬁcant in comparison to the wick resistance
for even thicker wicks (􀀄4 mm) when r^ ¼ 0:03. Also, the wick thermal resistance decreases when the wick thermal conductivity is increased and it is no longer the controlling thermal resistance in vapor chamber operation. An accurate determination of the interface thermal resistance becomes increasingly important for thinner wicks of high thermal conductivity. Novel wick structures containing metallic nanowires and carbon nanotubes [37], have been proposed recently. In this section, the numerical simulations are repeated for the same vapor chamber geometry described in the previous section except with a thinner wick (50 lm) and higher wick thermal conductivity (176.3 W/m K). The thermal conductiv-ity of the solid in the porous wick medium is set to be 400 W/m K. Some novel wick microstructures, such as carbon nanotubes and metallic nanowires, have been shown [38,39] to possess such high values of thermal conductivity. Also, the wick permeability is taken to be 2.97 􀀁 10􀀂10 m2. All other properties and boundary con-ditions for the vapor chamber are kept the same as discussed in the previous section.
Fig. 11(a) and (b) shows the temperature contours in the vapor chamber and velocity magnitude contours in the vapor core of the device. The temperature on the outer wall of the vapor chamber is plotted in Fig. 11(c). Results in Fig. 11 correspond to the coupled model and an accommodation coefﬁcient of 0.03. For this case, the liquid pressure drop inside the wick structure is 524 Pa while the steady-state operating pressure of the device is 29.4 kPa. dicted by the coupled and non-coupled models are 0.11 and 0.13 K, respectively. Hence, the non-coupled model over-predicts the tem-
perature drop by 􀀄15%. For ^r ¼ 0:03, the temperature drops across the vapor chamber as predicted by the coupled and non-coupled models are 1.49 and 1.18 K, respectively. This shows that the non-coupled model under-predicts the temperature drop across the vapor chamber by 􀀄26%. Fig. 12(a) presents the interfacial pressure drop and the local contact angle along the liquid–vapor
interface in the vapor chamber for r^ ¼ 0:03. The interfacial pres-sure drop (524 Pa) is highest at the center of the evaporator sec-tion, leading to the highest curvature and the smallest contact angle (55.7) at this location. Again, the contact angle increases from 55.7 in the evaporator section to 90 at the center of the con-denser region (i.e., at the wet point). Fig. 12(b) shows the mass ﬂux correction, area correction and mass ﬂow rate correction ratios along the liquid–vapor interface in the vapor chamber for
^r ¼ 0:03. The corrections in interface area and mass ﬂow rate are highest at the point of highest curvature and lowest contact angle, i.e., the center of the evaporator region (point 1). Again, the correc-tions become smaller as the condenser section is approached since the meniscus curvature in the wick pore decreases from the evap-oration center to the center of condenser region. 

4. Conclusions：
A three-dimensional numerical model for ﬂat heat pipes which accounts for the effect of wick structure in determining the evapo-ration rate at the liquid–vapor interface is developed. A device-le-vel macro-model is coupled with a wick-level micro-model. This coupling leads to corrections to the evaporative mass ﬂow rates at the liquid–vapor interface in the wick pore as well as to the interfacial area. These corrections are based on the local contact angle of liquid in the wick structure, and change along the location in the vapor chamber. Due to this coupling, thin-ﬁlm evaporation, meniscus curvature effects, and Marangoni convection effects on the heat transfer rate from the liquid–vapor interface are ac-counted for in the device-level macro-model. 
Flow and temperature ﬁelds in a two-dimensional ﬂat heat pipe/vapor chamber are computed using the original macro-model and the coupled macro-model. The simulations are performed for two different values of the accommodation coefﬁcient of the work-ing ﬂuid, viz., 0.03 and 1. From the results obtained using the cou-pled and non-coupled model, it is inferred that the thermal resistance offered by the liquid–vapor interface inside the vapor chamber may become signiﬁcant and affects the performance of the vapor chamber as the device is miniaturized, and as novel high-conductivity thin wicks become available. In these situations, the transport effects at the liquid–vapor interface must be cor-rectly incorporated in order to accurately predict the performance of the vapor chamber. The need for a coupled model becomes imperative when (a) the thickness of the wick structure is very small (in the order of 100 lm), (b) the thermal conductivity of wick structure is very high (>100 W/m K), or (c) when the accommoda-tion coefﬁcient of the working ﬂuid is very small (<0.1). The basic methodology developed in this work is applicable to other types of microstructures, operating conditions and device designs as well.Molecular dynamics simulation of thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires
ABSTRACT
We investigate the thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 
The simulated thermal conductivities of nanowires with square cross sections are found to be about two orders of magnitude smaller than those of bulk Si crystals in a wide range of temperatures (200–500K) for both rigid and free boundary conditions. 
A solution of the Boltzmann transport equation is used to explore the possibility of explaining the MD results based on boundary scattering.

1 Instroduction
Although a number of studies have been carried out on the thermal conductivity of thin films/superlattices, 
it is only recently that the investigation of heat conduction in one-dimensional structures such as nanowires has been initiated.
In two-dimensional structures, the effective thermal conductivity is a function of both boundary and internal phonon scattering. 
As a consequence of the boundary scattering, the thermal conductivity values may be reduced by one order of magnitude. 
The small cross section in nanowires implies a more significant reduction of the thermal conductivity than in thin films because of a higher surface to volume ratio. 
Furthermore, quantized thermal conductance has been predicted theoretically for the lowtemperature regime. 
Experimental work has thus focused exclusively on this temperature regime.
The thermal behavior of nanowires at moderate temperatures is little understood at this stage, both from an experimental and a theoretical point of view.
A study of the thermal conductivity in nanowires is reported here using the molecular dynamics ~MD! method. 
In a MD simulation, all the particle trajectories for a given system with a reasonably small number of atoms are calculated, which allows the derivation of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the system.
Direct MD simulation of infinite length nanowires is feasible because the boundaries of the wire provide realistic limitations on the phonon mean free path. 
Accordingly, we showed that the MD results are independent of the longitudinal wire size. 
Because of the surface reorganization, however, it is difficult to obtain convergent results for free boundary conditions. 
To overcome this difficulty, the computation is carried out such that the surfaces reorganize and stabilize before the commencement of the thermal conductivity calculation. 
The results show that the simulated thermal conductivity values of nanowires are about two orders of magnitude smaller than those of bulk crystals. 
Although there may be a number of reasons for this reduction, we explore the possibility of explaining the MD results with the Boltzmann transport equation ~BTE!, assuming a partly diffuse-scattering interface.

2 Method
Using the MD technique and the Stillinger–Weber interatomic potential model for Si, the trajectories, i.e., 
the time-dependent positions ri(t) and velocities vi(t) of the nanowire atoms, are computed. 
The temperature T can be readily calculated from the velocity vi of the atoms in the simulation domain since the Boltzmann distribution function allows the straightforward derivation of the mean kinetic energy ^Ec&
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, N the number of particles in the system, and M the atomic mass. However, Eq.
~1! holds only if the specific heat is not temperature dependent, which is true for temperatures above the Debye temperature. Between 200 and 500 K, if the simulated MD temperatures are compared to the Debye temperature u D
5645 K of Si, a quantum correction to both the MD temperature and the thermal conductivity must be carried out as described in previous publications.13 The heat flux expression is derived from the integration of the energy balance
equation combined with the definition of the total instantaneous heat flux in a statistical ensemble of constant energy. For the computed two- and three-body potentials, the heat flux can be calculated from
where Fi j and Fijk are the two- and three-body forces and V is the system volume. We perform the thermal conductivity simulations based on the equilibrium fluctuations of the heat flux q0(t)  since the Green–Kubo formula can be derived
from q0(t) according to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is the heat flux autocorrelation function and T0 is the equilibrium temperature.
To perform MD computations of the nanowire thermal conductivity, we construct the simulation domain from unit cells forming a face-centered cubic lattice with two Si atoms as basis. Systems with cross sections ranging from 434 to
10310 unit cells and 16 unit cells in the longitudinal direction are computed. These simulations correspond to atom
numbers ranging from 2048 to 12 800 since a diamond-like unit cell includes eight atoms. The silicon density is imposed by setting the lattice constant to 0.543 nm and periodic boundary conditions are applied in the longitudinal direction.
A 0.766 fs time step is taken in the integration of the equations of motion, which is a hundredth of the reference time scale tu50.0766 ps in Si. It is considered reasonable to extend the time of the simulation to one phonon mean relaxation time '20 ps.
The rigid transverse boundaries are first imposed by freezing surface atoms. The initial potential energy was applied to the system by placing atoms at the lattice nodes. A Gauss thermostat9 is used to fix the temperature and the final
results are checked to ensure that they are not modified by a change in the thermostat parameters. Once the temperature reaches the required value, the thermostat is removed and the heat flux calculation executed. We also check that the total
energy is well conserved throughout the thermal conductivity simulation. 
To verify that the longitudinal length Lx of the wire does not affect MD results, the sensitivity of the thermal conductivity to the simulated wire length is probed and representative results are illustrated in Fig. 1. The figure shows that the
thermal conductivity is not Lx dependent when Lx is larger than 16 lattice constants for wires with cross-sectional areas smaller than 28.62 nm2 . On the contrary, using the same approach in bulk Si crystals12 has led to thermal conductivity
values that increase with increasing simulation domain size, which confirms the hypothesis that the mean free path in nanowires is short and the Green–Kubo expression can be applied.
When systems with free transverse surfaces, i.e., free standing nanowires, are computed, surface atoms follow a rearrangement process so that a long relaxation takes place during which the kinetic energy increases while potential
energy fades to its minimal value. Due to the atomic diffusion, neighbor lists of each atom are frequently updated and the time step is reduced to t50.005tu in the computation instead of 0.01tu for rigid boundaries. For a
2.14 nm32.14 nm36.42 nm wire with 1536 atoms and rigid boundary conditions, the average computation time is 5 h using a HP9000-C180 workstation. For the same system with free boundaries, the computational time triples.

3 Results and discussion
In Fig. 2, the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity is plotted for different nanowire cross sections with free or rigid boundary conditions in the transverse directions. The difference between data from both types of
boundary conditions remains small, i.e., less than 10%. We observe that the thermal conductivity is slightly temperature dependent and increases with increasing cross-section area of the wires. Another striking feature is that thermal conductivity values are in the interval of 1–5 W/mK, which is one to
two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding data for bulk Si (lBulk5241 W/mK at 200 K and lBulk 581 W/mK at 500 K!.
There are several possible explanations for the reduction of the nanowire thermal conductivity found in the MD numerical experiments ~Fig. 2!: ~i! the change of phonon spectrum in 1D structures, which modifies the phonon group velocity and the scattering mechanisms,20,21 and ~ii! the
boundary inelastic scattering which increases diffuse reflections on the surfaces. Although a few studies have reported the effects of phonon group velocity reduction on the thermal conductivity of thin films,20 many experimental data can be
explained by classical size effects based on the Boltzmann transport equation.1,2,6 Here, we will explore the second point based on a general solution of the Boltzmann transport equation for phonon distribution function inside a thin wire
where g is the deviation of the phonon occupation number n from equilibrium g5n02n, LBulk is the average phonon mean free path and m is the cosine of the angle between the phonon group velocity and the longitudinal direction. In Eq.
~4!, the term inside the brackets includes ~i! the unity corresponding to the bulk material contribution and ~ii! a ratio representing the correction implied by the size effect. In this ratio, the phonon-phonon scattering of heat carriers starting
from boundary point rB and ending at the position r, along the direction defined by m, is included in the exponential terms. If Eq. ~4! is introduced into the expression of the heat flux perpendicular to the cross section S
where n is the frequency and D the phonon density of states, we find out the ratio of the thermal conductivity lnw of the nanowire to the bulk thermal conductivity lBulk where G(r) represents the ratio in Eq. ~4!.
Numerical results of Eq. ~3! are plotted as lines in Figs. 2 and 3. The latter shows the thermal conductivity as a function of the cross-sectional area. We note that the BTE and MD data are in good agreement when the interface specularity parameter p value is about 0.45. Figure 3 reveals that the
cross-sectional section dependency of the thermal conductivity follows a power law. Although the boundary scattering can explain the MD results, we should caution that other phenomena such as group velocity reduction may occur and
be responsible for the reduced thermal conductivity.

4 Conclusion
In conclusion, we have calculated the thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires using a MD technique based on the Green–Kubo formula. For nanowire cross sections ranging
from 2.58 to 28.62 nm2 , we computed the thermal conductivity for different longitudinal sizes and found that the thermal conductivity values become length independent when
the wire is longer than 8.56 nm, suggesting that the results approach those of infinite wires. The MD results reveal a one to two orders of magnitude reduction in the thermal conductivity of nanowires compared to those of corresponding bulk
Si crystals. We solved the Boltzmann transport equation to explore the possibility of diffuse boundary scattering causing the thermal conductivity drop as observed in the MD simulation. With an interface specularity parameter value of 0.45,
the MD results match the BTE solutions reasonably well. However, other mechanisms, such as the phonon group velocity and the scattering mechanism changes, may also be responsible for the thermal conductivity reduction.



Blocking Phonon Transport by Structural Resonances in Alloy-Based Nanophononic Metamaterials Leads to Ultralow Thermal Conductivity
ABSTRACT
Understanding the design rules to obtain materials that enable a tight control of phonon transport over a broad range of frequencies would aid major developments in thermoelectric energy harvesting, heat management in microelectronics, and information and communication technology. Using atomistic simulations we show that the metamaterials approach relying on localized resonances is very promising to engineer heat transport at the nanoscale. Combining designed resonant structures to alloying can lead to extremely low thermal conductivity in silicon nanowires. The hybridization between resonant phonons and propagating modes greatly reduces the group velocities and the phonon mean free paths in the low frequency acoustic range below 4 THz. Concurrently, alloy scattering hinders the propagation of high frequency thermal phonons. Our calculations establish a rationale between the size, shape, and period of the resonant structures, and the thermal conductivity of the nanowire, and demonstrate that this approach is even effective to block phonon transport in wavelengths much longer than the size and period of the surface resonant structures. A further consequence of using resonant structures is that they are not expected to scatter electrons, which is beneficial for thermoelectric applications.

1 Instruction
Controlling heat flow using nanophononic materials and devices is growing more and more appealing due to its broad applications in energy conversion and modern computations, including thermoelectrics, thermal cloaks, thermal logic gates, and thermal diodes [1–8]. For thermoelectric applications, one needs materials with a high electronic power factor, as in crystals, but a low thermal conductivity (TC) as in a glass [9]. Designing the TC of a crystalline system to approach or even be lower than the corresponding amorphous limit remains an open challenge both conceptually and technically [10]. The most common route to reduce TC is to exploit phonon scattering at interfaces in nanostructured composites or superlattices [11–14]. In general, only a limited range of phonon frequencies gets scattered efficiently, typically at a relatively high frequency, above 1–2 THz. Nevertheless, low frequency modes also have a significant contribution to the total TC due to their long mean free path (MFP) [15,16]. The best results along this line were obtained using hierarchical structures in heavy element materials, which introduce scatterers from the mesoscale to the atomic scale [17]. In silicon based materials this approach was followed by synthesizing SiGe nanocomposites [18], superlattices [13], and silicon nanomeshes [19,20]. However, in most cases grain boundaries, inclusions, and pores have a negative impact on electronic transport, thus hampering the thermoelectric performance.
As an alternative, the phonon resonant effect in metamaterials [21,22] has been recently proposed for TC design [23–25]. With a careful design of resonant structures, a set of resonant frequencies can be obtained, evidenced by a set of flat bands in the phonon dispersion. Because of the band anticrossing, the resonances interact with the propagating modes and reduce their phonon group velocities. This method allows for manipulating waves with wavelengths much larger than the structural features of the system [26]: low frequency resonances can be easily introduced with small resonant structures.
Branched nanowires (NWs) have been synthesized by the dislocation-driven mechanism [27] and the vapor-liquid-solid process [28–30]. Standing waves (resonances) can be generated inside the branches due to the total reflection of waves at the end of branches. As a result, branched NWs provide an ideal platform for phonon resonance studies and for low TC design. In this work, we report a systematic study on heat transport in Si based resonant structures. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that branched NWs can indeed produce numerous resonances in a broad frequency range. Those resonances interact with phonons in the main NW and reduce their group velocities. The heat flow in the main NW can be manipulated through the design of adequate resonators. We propose a promising methodology to block phonon transport at both low and high frequencies: an extremely low TC of 
0.9W/m⋅K in SiGe alloy crystalline NWs has been achieved with a combination of the phonon resonant and scattering effects.
We first created NWs in the ⟨100⟩ orientation with a periodic set of branches outside the NWs. The cross section of the main NW is a square with an edge length Le=4.34nm. The branches also have a squared cross section with an edge length 
Lbs=1.09nm and the height of the branches is set to Lh=1.63nm. To investigate the effect of the number of branches on thermal transport, we designed a set of NWs with branches on one side, two sides, and four sides of the main NW. Sketches of a two-side branched NW are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Simulations are carried out with the lammps code [31]. The atomistic 3D models of the NWs and simulation details can be found in Ref

2 Method
We calculated the TCs from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The TC of the one-side, two-side, and four-side branched NWs as a function of the period length is depicted in Fig. 1(d). For reference, the TC of the pristine NW computed with the same approach is 
19.8W/mK. This value is comparable to those obtained in former simulations of a square-section Si NW with a similar small diameter [40]. Experimental estimates for so thin NWs are currently not available, and it is worth stressing that our pristine reference model exhibits perfect flat surfaces, which may not be attainable in experiments [41,42] (see the discussions in Ref. [32]). The TC of branched NWs is much smaller than that of the pristine NW, especially at short period lengths. With the increase of the period length, the TC increases gradually for all cases. Besides, the TC is also reduced when more sides of the NW are branched due to the increased hybridization, which further reduces the group velocity as will be discussed later.
Since more branches produce stronger hybridization, we extend the branched structure to square wall surrounded structures [hereafter referred as “surrounded NWs,” see Fig. 1(c) and Fig. S1 [32] ], to further promote the TC reduction. The thickness of the walls is 1.09 nm while their height is 1.63 nm, i.e., the same dimensions as the studied branches. This structure can be fabricated by the vapor-liquid-solid method with the catalysis diffusion technique [43]. As expected, the TC is further reduced at all periods when compared to all other cases [Fig. 1(d)]. The TC reduction can reach up to 67% at the period of 2.17 nm compared to the one of the pristine NW. The increased anharmonicity at high temperature will reduce the relative TC reduction in resonant NWs. However, due to the strong hindering of low frequency phonons, the relative TC reduction in the surrounded Si NWs with respect to the value of the pristine Si NW can still be 50% at 800 K (Fig. S5 [32]). It is worth noting that the shape of the resonant nanostructures does not affect the TC significantly: the same TC is found in the square and circle wall surrounded Si NWs (Fig. S4 [32]). The TC reduction achieved solely by introducing the resonant structures is comparable to the one achieved in surface engineered NWs
To more deeply understand the origin of the phonon resonant effect, we calculated the phonon dispersion relations and the group velocities 
vg of different structures based on harmonic lattice dynamics [44,45]. The comparison of phonon dispersion relations between the pristine structure and the two-side branched structures with 
Lp=2.17nm is illustrated in Figs. 2(a)–2(c), where Lh in Fig. 2(c) is twice Lh in Fig. 2(b). With the addition of periodic branches on the main NW surfaces, a series of resonant flat bands crossing the entire Brillouin zone is generated. The resonant modes hybridize with the modes of the main wire due to the band anticrossing effect, which occurs when two modes with the same polarization located on different objects are coupled at the same frequency. Specifically, in our case, if a resonant mode from the pillars has the same polarization as a propagating mode in the main NW, they will hybridize and form two new modes (up and down branches) when their frequencies converge. This mechanism leads to the formation of mini band gaps, the widths of which depend on the coupling or hybridization strength as observed both in theoretical models [46–49], and experimentally [50,51] in acoustic metamaterials.
To provide a picture of how propagating modes hybridize with the resonant modes, we have visualized the modes indicated by the symbols in Fig. 2(b). The hybridization effect between the longitudinal acoustic (LA) mode and the lowest resonance is examined by the eigenvectors. Starting from the mode far away from the resonant frequency (circle), a pure LA mode can be identified from Fig. 2(e): all atoms vibrate along the phonon transport direction 
z with the same amplitude, following the feature of the LA mode. For the mode on the resonant flat band (triangle, a bending mode), it only distributes on the resonant branches; no atoms in the main NW participate in the vibration [Fig. 2(g)]. A hybridized mode resulting from the coupling between the LA mode and the resonant phonon can be identified near to the resonant frequency [square, Fig. 2(f)], where the mismatch in the vibrational amplitudes in the main NW and in the resonator results in a reduced 
vg. The effect on the upper side of the resonance is similar to that on the lower side but the atom vibrations in the main NW and on the branches are in opposite phase [Fig. 2(h)]. The enhanced hybridization effect produced by increasing the number of branches is evidenced by the reduced 
vg when more surfaces are branched [Fig. 2(d)]. A stronger hybridization enlarges the resonant minigaps as can be seen from the group velocities by polarization in Fig. S3
The proposed resonant structures offer several advantages in manipulating phonon transport. First, the resonators can produce numerous resonant frequencies in almost the entire frequency range. As a result, the phonon group velocity can be dramatically suppressed at both superwavelength and subwavelength frequencies [Fig. 2(d)]. Second, the resonant frequency can be tuned by altering the branch size and material. The comparison between Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) provides a clear picture of the size effect: when the branch height doubled from 1.63 nm to 3.26 nm, the lowest resonant frequency shifts from 0.2 to 0.06 THz. The increased size of the resonators will also increase the number of resonances. One can therefore adjust the number and the frequency of the resonances by modifying the size of the resonant structures. Consequently, the TC can be easily designed and the heat flow in the main wire can be controlled in a more accurate way. Another important feature of this structure is that the low frequencies can be easily manipulated with small branches, which yields the third advantage of the structure. As discussed above, the lowest resonant frequency can reach down to 0.2 THz with a branch height 
Lh=1.63nm and even to 0.06 THz with Lh=3.26nm. The ability to manipulate such low frequencies with small branches is the key advantage of the resonant mechanism over the scattering mechanism, where the size of scattering sources has to be larger than or comparable to the phonon wavelength. Generally, the phonon scattering mechanism provides an efficient way to block the high frequency phonons while it remains challenging in dealing with phonons with, for example, 
f≤2THz in Si NWs [53] and carbon nanotubes [54]. In contrast with scattering strategies, where the scattering source is located inside the material, the resonant mechanism applies the wave nature of phonons and is produced from a position outside from the main structure. As a result, the resonators are not supposed to scatter electrons. Although there is a substantial modification of the phonon band structure by the resonances, first principles calculations on core-shell NWs [55,56] and elastic theory studies on superlattices [57] have shown that phonon band modifications also have a minor effect on the electrical conductivity.
To achieve the most effective reduction of the TC, one should design a material in which contributions from both the high and low frequency modes are reduced. Since the scattering mechanism is efficient to block high frequency modes and resonances can stop low frequency phonons promisingly, the combination of both effects provides the possibility to block phonons in the full frequency range. Alloying is one of the most efficient ways to scatter high frequency phonons. As a consequence, we have designed a set of surrounded 
Si1−xGex NWs with Ge concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.

3 Results and discussion
Figure 1(e) reveals the Ge concentration dependent TCs for the pristine and surrounded NWs. The TC of the amorphous Si NW of the same size ( 1.7W/m⋅K) calculated at 300 K with the same method is shown as the dashed line for comparison. The TC of pure Si/Ge can be extensively reduced down to 2.5 W/m⋅K with a Ge concentration in the range of 0.3–0.7. Although extremely low TCs have already been obtained via alloy scattering, those values can still be reduced by a factor of 2 with the introduction of surrounded walls 1.63 nm in height. The simulated surrounded alloy NWs have TCs below the amorphous Si NW limit except in the case with 
x=0.1. This indicates that adding resonant structures could be crucial for improving the thermoelectric performance of SiGe alloys. Since the height of the walls can modify the resonant frequency, we also simulated the surrounded SiGe NWs with a doubled wall height. Because of the modification of the low frequency resonances, the TC is further reduced and a value of 
0.9W/m⋅K is obtained. This extremely low value is about half the corresponding amorphous Si NW TC and 36% of the SiGe alloy NW minimum. In other words, the combination of phonon resonant and scattering mechanisms produces a 22-fold decrease of the pristine Si NW TC.
To quantitatively clarify the respective role of phonon scattering and resonant effects on the TC reduction, we calculated the length dependent phonon transmission functions (Fig. 3) from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics [58,59] (details in Ref. [32]). The ballistic transmission, which is essentially the number of modes in the leads, is shown in all cases to facilitate the comparisons. Because of the anharmonic effect, the transmission of the high frequency phonons in the pristine Si NW decreases when the sample length increases [Fig. 3(a)]. However, ballistic transport can be clearly observed below 1 THz, where the transmission is only slightly decreased even for the NW length of 
1μm. In the surrounded Si NW [Fig. 3(b)], the most noticeable difference with the pristine Si NW case is that the transmissions at frequencies smaller than 4.5 THz are significantly suppressed. This phenomenon demonstrates the importance of the resonant effect at low frequencies, where the number of phonon branches is small but the group velocities are large. Contrary to the features in surrounded Si NWs, the transmission in the 
Si0.5Ge0.5 NW is dramatically reduced at high frequencies even at a very short length [Fig. 3(c)]. However, similar to the pristine Si NW case, ballistic transport is preserved below 1 THz. The strong transmission reductions at low frequencies caused by the resonant effect and at high frequencies due to the scattering effect finally result in reduced transmissions in the whole frequency range in the surrounded 
Si0.5Ge0.5 NWs [Fig. 3(d)]. Note that in the alloyed cases (both pristine and surrounded), the modes at high frequencies (typically above 10 THz) are not propagating modes due to the introduction of heavy Ge atoms. This is evidenced by the extremely low transmission even with a sample length of only 3.8 nm.
From the length dependent transmission functions, we evaluated the frequency resolved phonon MFPs [54,59] using Eq. S4 [32]. As revealed in Fig. 4, the MFP of the pristine Si NW increases rapidly as the frequency shifts below 4 THz. When adding the resonant structure on the surface of the Si NWs, the MFP above 4 THz is reduced roughly by one half. The MFPs of the low frequency phonons are even more reduced by orders of magnitude. Instead, if the scattering sources (Ge atoms) are embedded in the Si NW, the MFP is greatly reduced above 2 THz, while it is not significantly affected below 2 THz. The comparisons among the three samples provide additional evidence that the scattering and resonant mechanisms appear as an ideal combination to design extremely low TCs. This statement is supported by the MFP of surrounded 
Si0.5Ge0.5 NWs, where the MFP in the entire frequency range is reduced by orders of magnitude. The frequency response of the MFPs on resonances and alloys is also revealed by the TC cumulative functions [60] (Fig. S6 [32]).

4 Conclusion
In conclusion, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations on the TC of Si based resonant NW structures, i.e., branched and wall surrounded NWs. The results reveal that phonon resonance is a powerful TC reduction mechanism. Differing from the commonly adopted scattering method, low frequency phonons can be easily manipulated with small resonators. Both the resonant frequency and strength can be tuned by changing the resonator size, offering the freedom in controlling the heat flow more accurately. The combination of phonon resonant and scattering mechanisms yields a TC of 
0.9 W/m⋅K, which is only 53% of the corresponding Si NW amorphous TC limit and 4.5% of the value of the pristine Si NW. This achievement relies on the hindering of phonon transport in the whole frequency range. The extremely low TC here obtained also supports the potential impact of resonator based structures on thermoelectric conversion.

Interface diffusion-induced phonon localization in two-dimensional lateral heterostructures
ABSTRUCT
We report that the interface composition diffusion, which often  occurs  in the synthesis of  two- dimensional lateral heterostructures, can significantly suppress the thermal transport property. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the thermal conductivity of graphene/h-BN lateral heterostructures can be largely tuned by varying the interface composition diffusion length. The under- ling mechanism is explained by Anderson localization of phonons, which is corroborated by the exponen- tial decay of the phonon transmission with composition gradient length. Phase breaking interactions are shown to delocalize the modes at elevated temperatures. The findings in this work suggest that compo- sition graded interfaces can be used to tune the thermal transport of heterostructures via phonon local- ization, which is important for their applications in electronics, thermoelectrics and thermal insulators

1 Instruction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitrides (h-BN), and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, e.g., MoS2) have intrigued experimental and theoretical workers for their exceptional electrical, thermal, and optical properties. These different 2D materials can be integrated into lateral 2D heterostruc- ture. The resulting artificial 2D structures provide access to new properties and applications beyond their component 2D atomic crystals and therefore, they are emerging as a new exciting field of research [1].
The synthesis of 2D lateral heterostructures has achieved signif- icant progress in recent years [2–15]. The composition diffusion at the interface, which can cause nonabrupt, graded boundaries, is a key issue of interface formation in conventional heterostructures as well as their monolayer analogs [4]. Notably, compositional transition is often reported at the interface of these 2D heterostruc- tures, which is typically in the range of 1 35 nm. Liu et al. [5] demonstrated the creation of graphene and h-BN (Gr/h-BN) in- plane heterostructures by using lithography patterning and sequential chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth steps. The
sharpness of lateral interface between the h-BN and graphene layers was observed to be within 1 nm. Levendorf et al. reported the synthesis of Gr/h-BN lateral heterostructures with a patterned regrowth technique [6]. The obtained heterojunction has a compo- sitional transition width of no more than 10 nm. Sutter et al. [4] report that high-temperature growth leads to intermixing near the interface of Gr/h-BN lateral heterostructures, similar to interfa- cial alloying in conventional heterostructures. Duan et al. [7] designed a thermal CVD process to synthesis WS2-WSe2 lateral heterostructures. The junction shows a transition from WS2 to WSe2 phases over a length scale of 35 nm. Slight inter-diffusion of transition-metal elements is also often observed along the arm- chair interfaces of WS2 and MoS2 lateral heterostructures, typically over a width of 1–3 unit cells
There are several factors that lead to the composition-graded interface, including the temperature of the growth [4], the switch- ing rate of the vapour-phase reactants and (or) ion diffusion across the interface [7], and the edge stability during the epitaxial growth [8], etc. The Gr/h-BN interface can even be tuned from compara- tively sharp to graded by controlling the duration of a preheating period of the BN source [10]. While clean and sharp interfaces of  2D heterostructures are essential for preserving their optoelec- tronic properties [8], composition graded interface may have significant impact on the heat transport of 2D heterostructures. Unfortunately, little is known about the thermal property of 2D heterostructures with composition-graded interfaces, which is urgently needed for evaluating their potentials in the applications of electronics and thermoelectrics.
In this work, we report that the interface composition diffusion, even with a width of several nanometers, can significantly hinder the thermal transport property of Gr/h-BN lateral heterostructures. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the thermal conductivity j of Gr/h-BN heterostructures can be largely tuned
by the interface composition diffusion length. Phonon localization is identified to be the cause of heat transfer suppressing in such structures at room temperature. The findings in this work suggest that introducing nonabrupt, graded interface to materials can be beneficial for their applications in thermoelectrics and thermal insulators, where low thermal conductivity is desired.

2 Method
We started from a 4.2  111.2 nm Gr/h-BN lateral heterostructure with an abrupt interface. The interface was built with C-B zigzag linking edges in our models, since the zigzag edges were reported to be more preferably formed than the armchair counterparts
[9]. The CAC, CAB, and BAN bond lengths were all set as 1.42 Å in the simulation with a lattice mismatch of  2:1% for h-BN, which has negligible effects on its thermal properties. The structures with composition-graded interfaces were
then generated by randomly switching the C (B/N) atoms by their B/N (C) counterparts across the interface. Within a distance L, the number of atoms ratio for C:B/N gradually decreases from 90%:10% to 10%:90%, as shown in Fig. 1(a). We studied the systems
where L equals 8 nm, 16 nm and 24 nm, respectively. Here we define L as the compositional transition width. At the same composition proportion, the heterogeneous atoms (for example, carbon atoms in h-BN matrix) can appear individually, alternatively, several C atoms can aggregate and form a ‘‘particle”. Thus in our study, models with four different sizes of the heterogeneous particles in
the composition grading were built, each respectively consists of one, two, six and ten atoms (Fig. 1(b)).
Models shown in Fig. 1 were used in the non-equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations, for the phonon transmission spectra calculations.
Because of the non-linear temperature gradient in the composition graded structures, it is difficult to obtain the thermal conductivity (j) from the direct method in NEMD. We thus resort to equilibrium MD (EMD) simulations and the Green–Kubo method.
The initial structures shown in Fig. 2 were relaxed using a conjugate gradient energy minimization algorithm. 
Periodic boundary conditions were used in all directions. To mimic the free-stand structures, a vacuum of 20 nm is used in the direction perpendicular to the sheets. The MD time step was set to 0.5 fs. An MD run of
200 ps in the canonical ensemble (NVT) was performed to impose a temperature of 300 K. Then, the microcanonical ensemble (NVE) was applied for another 200 ps to achieve thermal equilibrium.
Finally, the instantaneous heat fluxes along the armchair axis jAðtÞ were collected from MD runs with lengths equal to 2 ns. The Green–Kubo formula [24] was used to evaluate the thermal conductivity (jA) along the armchair direction:
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, and V the system volume. The angular brackets denote the ensemble average, performed here over twenty independent MD simulations
To quantitatively clarify the respective role of phonon scattering mechanisms, we calculated the composition transition width (L) dependent phonon transmission functions (T(x)) from NEMD.
T(x) was calculated based on the method developed by K.Saaskilahti et al. [25,26]. The frequency resolved heat flux between any atom iand jcan be expressed as:
where tsimu and x are the simulation time and the frequency, respectively. ^vai ðxÞ and ^vbj ðxÞ are the Fourier transformed atomic velocities of atom i in direction a and atom j in direction b, respectively. For calculating the flux spectra, the force constant
matrix is calculated with the finite displacement method by LAMMPS, i.e., after relaxing the structures to the potential minimum, atom i is moved in the directions x;y; and  z with a small
value (D = 0.01 Å). After each displacement, the forces F of each atoms are calculated. As a result, the element of the force constant matrix can be evaluated as:
Here Fb j and Fbþ j denote the force on atom j in b direction when atom i is displace to -a and +a directions, respectively.
The heat current across any interface separating adjacent atom sets L and R can be obtained by summing over atoms in each set:
The phonon transmission function can thus be defined according to the spectral heat current as
where DT is the temperature difference of the two thermal baths in NEMD simulations. The atoms at the two ends of the structures shown in Fig. 1 are
fixed. The atoms located within the distance Lbath = 30 nm from left and right adjacent to fixed areas are coupled to hot and cold Langevin heat baths at temperatures L þ DT=2 and L  DT=2, respectively.
The MD time step was set to 0.5 fs, and the coupling time constant of the Langevin thermostat was chosen as stime = 1 ps.
The mean thermal bath temperature was fixed as T = 300 K, and DT was set as 60 K.

3 Results and discussion
Fig. 3 shows the calculated thermal conductivity of Gr/h-BN
with different composition diffusion lengths and different sizes
of heterogeneous particles. The j of Gr/h-BN with abrupt interfaces
is calculated as 324 W/mK, and the structures with composition
graded interfaces clearly possess much lower j. In general, j
decreases against L for all the models, indicating that the composition
transition width is an influential factor in tuning the thermal
transport property. This result can be understood as that when
the spatial extent of the composition diffusion is larger, phonon
scattering will occur in a broader spatial range along the structure
and results in a shorter phonon mean free path, which is corroborated
in the next section. Similar phenomenon was observed in
SiGe superlattice nanowires with composition graded interfaces
[27]. Note that j of the BNC hexagonal structures with random
composition distributions is calculated as 58 W/mK, indicating the
lower limit of j in Gr/h-BN lateral heterostructures.
At L = 8 nm, the size of the heterogeneous particle has obvious
impact on j: smaller particles lead to lower j. It can be seen from
Fig. 1(b) that at the same position along the structure, smaller
heterogeneous particles are more scattered, which leads to a
greater chance for phonon scattering. Indeed, the phonon mean
free path of graphene with h-BN domains was reported to decrease
with decreasing domain size [28]. As L increases, the particle size
impacts j less because L predominates the j reduction.
Fig. 4 depicts the composition transition width-dependent phonon
transmission spectra at 300 K. Here we focus on the systems
with heterogeneous particles consist of one atom and six atoms
(Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively). For a comparison, the system with
uniform interface intermixing (no composition grading) is also
studied. In general, the investigated systems exhibit similar behavior:
the phonon transmission decreases with L for most of the frequencies.
A lower phonon transmission indicates more hindrance
in thermal transport, which is in accordance with the
L-dependent thermal conductivity shown in Fig. 3. The ballistic
transport can be observed below 1 THz for the composition
graded structures, where the transmission is insensitive to L.
For higher frequencies, the crossover from the ballistic to the
diffusive regime is expected to occur, where a power law decay
with composition grading length (T(x)/ L1) should be observed
[29]. As L increases, the heterogeneous particles-induced backscattering
effects may become increasingly important, and the localization
regime can be established, featured by the exponential
decay of phonon transmission [30] as T(x)/ eL=n. Here n denotes
the phonon localization length, which indicates the typical length
needed for the occurrence of phonon localization in disordered systems.
Phonon localization has been previously observed in
graphene-based systems such as amorphous graphene [31], disordered
graphene phononic crystals [32] and graphene nanomesh
[33], etc. It was also found in silicon nanowires [34,35]. To identify
the phonon suppressing mechanism in our systems, we fit T(x)
with both power law decay (Eq. (6)) and exponential decay ((Eq.
(7)) with different L for each frequency:
where A is a fitting parameter, and T0ðxÞ is the phonon transmission
coefficient of the structure with abrupt interface. We used
the coefficient of determination, R2, to evaluate the goodness of
the fit [36]. An R2 of 1 indicates that the model perfectly fits the
data.
Interestingly, fitting TðxÞ to Eq. (6) gives low values of R2
(below 0.7) over the whole frequency range of the three structures,
suggesting that the diffusive regime in our structures is not distinct
and phonon mean free paths (lmfp) and n are not well-separated. In
contrast, fitting TðxÞ to Eq. (7) can give very high values of R2,
depending on the frequency, which provides the evidence of
Anderson localization for the modes of these frequencies. From
the well-fitted curves (R2 P0.96), we can obtain the frequency
dependent phonon localization length, as plotted in Fig. 5(a). It
can be clearly seen that more phonon modes (especially with frequencies
below 10 THz) are localized in the models with
composition-graded interfaces, with respect to the one with uniform
intermixing section. It also shows that larger scatter size (larger
heterogeneous particle) traps more phonons due to Anderson
localization.
Anderson localization for a certain phonon frequency will happen
only if incoherent effects are weak. At higher temperatures
where the anharmonic relaxation length (l/) is comparable to or
smaller than the localization length (i.e. l/ 6 n), the localization
effects will not take place. In other words, the anharmonicity will
destroy phonon localization at elevated temperatures [37,38]. To
gain more insights, we calculated n at higher temperatures
(500 K and 800 K), and the results are shown in Fig. 5(b), (c) and
(d). Indeed, for all the three models, the population of localized
modes obviously decreases with temperature, over the whole frequency
range.
From the L-dependent phonon transmission spectra, we evaluated
the frequency resolved lmfp [39] from the relationship
TðxÞ ¼ NðxÞ 1 þ L lmfp 1, where NðxÞ is the number of phonon
modes at a given frequency in pure graphene. The calculated lmfp
for the model with 6-atom heterogeneous particles and the one
with abrupt interface are plotted in Fig. 6(a). Also plotted is the
anharmonic relaxation length (l/) in graphite materials, which is
roughly estimated [40] from l/ ¼ BT1x2; B ¼ 3:35  1023 mKs2.
As revealed in Fig. 6(a), lmfp of Gr/h-BN lateral heterostructure
decreases with composition diffusion width, which complies with
our thermal conductivity calculations. l/ is estimated to be orders
of magnitude larger than lmfp in Gr/h-BN lateral heterostructures,
which confirms that the incoherent effects are weak in our systems
at 300 K.
In addition, we calculated the Thouless length [41,42]
n0 ¼ NðxÞlmfp, which is a crude estimation of the localization length.
According to Fig. 6(b), n0 is larger than n, suggesting that the Thouless
relation does not hold in our case. There are two possible reasons
for this discrepancy: firstly, the Thouless relation is under the
assumptions of weak disorder and isotropic scattering. Our systems
with interface diffusion has an anisotropic feature in composition
through the graded interface, which may cause anisotropic
scattering. Secondly, the Thouless relation requires the diffusive
and localized regimes are clearly separated [43]. However, the failure
of fitting TðxÞ to Eq. (6) (R2 60.7) indicates that the diffusive
regime in our particular system is indistinct, thus the separation
of transport regimes is not so clear-cut. The relatively small number
of transport channels (NðxÞ  20) also verifies this argument
for the occurrence of phonon localization in the systems under
investigation remains in the length scale of tens of nanometers,
which is not quite affected by the phonon frequency.
The interface roughness is reported to slightly increase the
interface thermal conductance by changing the contact area [44–
46]. It is interesting to note that the interface diffusion introduces
disorders over large spatial extent (to tens of nanometers) around
the interface rather than local topography change, which severelly
scatters phonons over the whole disordered structure.

4 Conclusion
In summary, we report that the thermal conductivity of
graphene/h-BN lateral heterostructures is largely dependent on
the structure of the interfaces. Our molecular dynamics simulations
show that the length of the interface composition diffusion
can be used to tune the thermal conductivity of the heterostructures.
The analyses of phonon transmission function prove the
existence of the localized phonons, which is identified to be the
primary cause of the phonon suppressing. Phase breaking interactions
are shown to delocalize the modes at elevated temperatures
due to the increased anharmonicities. This work suggests that the
interface formation of 2D lateral heterostructures has significant
impact on the thermal transport, and nonabrupt, graded interface
can be beneficial for their applications in thermoelectrics and thermal
insulators, where low thermal conductivity is desired.Co-designing electronics with microfluidics for more sustainable cooling

Abstract:
Thermal management is one of the main challenges for the future of electronics1–5. With the ever-increasing rate of data generation and communication, as well as the constant push to reduce the size and costs of industrial converter systems, the power density of electronics has risen6. Consequently, cooling, with its enormous energy and water consumption, has an increasingly large environmental impact7,8, and  new technologies are needed to extract the heat in a more sustainable way—that is, requiring less water and energy9. Embedding liquid cooling directly inside the chip is a promising approach for more efficient thermal management5,10,11. However, even in state-of-the-art approaches, the electronics and cooling are treated separately, leaving the full energy-saving potential of embedded cooling untapped. Here we show that by co-designing microfluidics and electronics within the same semiconductor substrate we can produce a monolithically integrated manifold microchannel cooling structure with efficiency 
beyond what is currently available. Our results show that heat fluxes exceeding 1.7 kilowatts per square centimetre can be extracted using only 0.57 watts per square centimetre of pumping power. We observed an unprecedented coefficient of performance (exceeding 10,000) for single-phase water-cooling of heat fluxes exceeding 1 kilowatt per square centimetre, corresponding to a 50-fold increase compared to straight microchannels, as well as a very high average Nusselt number  of 16. The proposed cooling technology should enable further miniaturization of electronics, potentially extending Moore’s law and greatly reducing the energy consumption in cooling of electronics. Furthermore, by removing the need for large external heat sinks, this approach should enable the realization of very compact power converters integrated on a single chip.

1.Introduction:
In the USA alone, data centres consume 24 TWh of electricity and 100 billion litres of water to satisfy their cooling demands8, correspond-ing to the residential needs of a city of the size of Philadelphia12–14. The environmental impact of this information technology infrastructure is expected to increase dramatically9, for example, accounting for up to 31% of Ireland’s electricity demand by 2027 (ref. 15), in large part due to the power consumption of cooling systems. This development is accompanied by the constant push to shrink the size of semiconductor devices, which results in higher heat fluxes that become increasingly challenging to extract and require new cooling solutions. A similar need is observed in power electronics, as the electrification of our society demands more powerful, more efficient and smaller energy conver-sion systems. Wide-bandgap semiconductors, such as gallium nitride (GaN), are promising candidates for this purpose16. These materials enable much smaller dies than those of traditional semiconductors as well as the monolithic integration of power devices, supporting the miniaturization of complete power converters into a single chip17. However, to unlock the full potential of GaN, strategies for sustainable cooling of high-heat-flux applications are required.
Substantial research efforts have focused on improving the thermal path between the hotspot and the coolant. However, heat extraction capability is fundamentally limited by the thermal resistance between the semiconductor die and packaging. Furthermore, relying on large heat sinks reduces the power density and hinders integration, since devices cannot be densely packed. Bringing the coolant in direct contact with the device may be a way to overcome this limiting factor, for exam-ple, by impinging coolant on a bare die18 or by etching micrometre-sized channels directly inside the device to turn the substrate into a heat sink. The latter technique demonstrated state-of-the-art cooling per-formance due to the highly efficient heat transfer at the microscale19–21. The high pressure drop and large temperature gradients associated with these straight, parallel microchannels (SPMCs) were overcome by splitting the flow into multiple parallel sections, and distributing the coolant over these channels using manifolds22Early investigations23–26 and systematic numerical studies27–30 of manifold microchannel (MMC) heat sinks showed a large reduction in pumping power requirements and thermal resistance compared to SPMCs. Excellent heat extraction has been demonstrated with copper MMCs31, compact micro-fabricated multilayer silicon structures32–35 and by using additive manufactur-ing36,37. However, in all these approaches, the heat sink and electronic structure and fabrication process are considered separately, either by integrating a simple resistive heater functioning as the heat source, or by bonding the MMC structure to a commercial device38. This leaves the large potential of MMCs untapped. Improving the thermal coupling between the heat source and cooling has been investigated for hotspot mitigation39–41, but has remained unexplored in a complete device structure. Furthermore, despite much MMC heat sink research, the increasing complexity and associated reliability concerns caused by  the multiple bonded layers required for coolant delivery have pre-vented the adoption of MMCs in commercial devices.
In this work, we address these concerns by combining cooling and device design, using an approach in which a MMC heat sink is designed and fabricated in conjunction with the electronics. We present a mono-lithically integrated manifold microchannel (mMMC) heat sink in a single-crystalline silicon substrate with an epilayer, produced without the need for cumbersome bonding steps. Here the device design and heat-sink fabrication are combined within the same process, with bur-ied cooling channels embedded directly below the active area of the chip. Coolant thus impinging directly on the heat sources provides local and efficient heat extraction (Fig. 1a). On the back of this same substrate, manifold channels spread the liquid over the die (Fig. 1c) to obtain high temperature uniformity and low pressure drop, lead-ing to a very low pumping-power consumption and vastly improved cooling performance. Since the electronics and microfluidics are fully coupled and aligned (Fig. 1b), we call this approach microflu-idic–electronic co-design. We demonstrated microfluidic–electronic co-design on GaN-on-Si, a low-cost platform that is promising for real-izing high-power converters on a chip, comprising a GaN epilayer a few micrometres thick on a low-cost silicon substrate. The passive silicon substrate typically lacks functionality, but by turning it into an active cooling layer, it has the potential to extract extreme heat fluxes,  without requiring the added cost of high-thermal-conductivity  substrates. Our results show that considering cooling as an integral part of device design can result in orders-of-magnitude improvements in cooling performance. We use this embedded-cooling approach  to demonstrate a super-compact GaN-on-silicon integrated  alternating–direct current (a.c.–d.c.) converter, containing four  power devices on the same microfluidic-cooled chip, and yielding a power density of 25 kW dm−3. A simple multi-layered printed cir-cuit board (PCB) was designed to direct the coolant flow into the  semiconductor device

2.Co-design concept and fabrication:
Our co-design approach, in which each heat source is coupled to an individual buried cooling-channel serving as a local heat sink, is particularly of interest in GaN power electronic applications with a lateral high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) structure. Typi-cal source–drain spacing for HEMTs in >1-kV applications matches  the optimum dimensions for microchannel cooling of about 20 µm (refs. 19,42–44). Therefore, we investigated a GaN-on-Si device structure in which liquid impinges directly onto the epilayer below each contact, ensuring minimum thermal resistance between the hotspot and cool-ant. In this structure (Fig. 1a), the GaN epilayer provides the power electronics (Fig. 1b), and the silicon functions as a microchannel cooling and fluid-distribution network in a three-dimensional arrangement(Fig. 1c). Figure 1d illustrates the corresponding fabrication method.  A staggered pattern of slits was formed in the Si by anisotropic deep etching through narrow incisions in the AlGaN/GaN epilayer to achieve the desired microchannel depth. This pattern provided better struc-tural integrity of the epilayer during fabrication compared to con-tinuous slits. During the subsequent isotropic gas-etch, the channels widened and coalesced in the silicon substrate, while being monitored through the transparent GaN epilayer using an in situ optical etch-rate tracking. This two-step etching process provides independent control over channel width and depth, making it suitable to a wide range of contact pitches. The incisions were finally hermetically sealed during the device metallization step. The Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1 explain the fabrication procedure in detail. Figure 1e shows a scan-ning electron microscope (SEM) image of the device after the metal-lization step with sealed channels. Because of the narrow incisions in the epilayer, the contacts do not require substantial oversizing. The microchannels are in direct contact with the active area of the chip, thus providing excellent thermal coupling between the hotspot and the cooling channel (Fig. 1f). Through micrometre-sized openings in the epilayer, 125-µm-deep and 20-µm-wide channels were created in the silicon substrate (Fig. 1g, h).
A series of devices was fabricated with SPMCs with equal width and spacing of 100 µm, 50 µm and 25 µm, and a channel depth of 250 µm in GaN-on-Si power devices, functioning as reference heat sinks (Fig. 2a) for evaluating the performance of the co-designed electronic-microfluidic mMMC devices. Three mMMC chips with 2, 4 and 10 inlet and outlet manifold channels and identical 20 × 125 µm microchannels were fab-ricated, referred to as the 2×-, 4×- and 10×-manifold chips (Fig. 2b). Figure 2c shows a picture of the mMMC device with the 10×-manifold, including a schematic (Fig. 2d) to illustrate the flow path with coolant impinging directly onto the bottom of the GaN epilayer.
Thermo-hydraulic evaluation:
A thermo-hydraulic analysis, using de-ionized water as a coolant, was performed on the cooling structures (Fig. 2a, b) to assess the cool-ing performance by measuring the thermal resistance, pressure drop and the resulting cooling coefficient of performance (COP), which indicates the energy efficiency of the heat sink. Figure 3a shows the total thermal resistance (Rtotal) between the surface temperature rise and the inlet temperature for the evaluated structures. By reducing the SPMC channel dimensions from 100 µm to 25 µm at identical flow rates, Rtotal reduces, which can be attributed to the increased surface area for heat transfer. However, the 4×- and 10×-manifold heat sinks show an additional substantial reduction in Rtotal compared to the 25-µm SPMC, approaching the limit of single-phase water-cooling (defined by its heat capacity). Rtotal was separated into three components: the contribution due to the heating of the water based on its heat capacity (Rheat), the contribution due to convective heat transfer in the micro-channels (Rconv), and the contribution due to conduction (Rcond). The full data reduction procedure to obtain these values is explained in the Methods and in Extended Data Fig. 3. A breakdown of Rtotal is shown in Fig. 3b, revealing a strong relation between Rconv and microchannel size, where smaller channels reduce Rconv. A large decrease in Rconv was achieved with the 10×-manifold, resulting in an 85% and 76% reduc-tion compared to the 50-µm and 100-µm-wide SPMCs, respectively. In combination with a very low Rcond for the co-designed manifolds, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml s−1, a thermal resistance of 0.43 K W−1 was achieved. The 10×-manifold design thus allows heat fluxes up to 1,723 W cm−2 for a maximum temperature rise of 60 K, which is more than twice that of a 25-µm-wide SPMC.
Narrow channels, however, require a higher pressure to achieve equal flow rate (Fig. 3c). For a flow rate of 0.5 ml s−1, SPMC widths of 100 µm, 50 µm and 25 µm require pressures of 160 mbar, 260 mbar and 810 mbar, respectively. The manifold structure substantially low-ers the pressure drop by reducing the length of the flow path through the microchannel. When splitting the flow into smaller sections with the 10×-manifold, the pressure drop reduced to just 210 mbar. This highlights the benefit of the MMC structure: a lower thermal resistance than SPMCs can be obtained at a reduced pumping power consumption. However, although the manifold structure can reduce the pressure drop, the additional contractions and turns of the fluid can hinder this reduction. For example, 20-µm-wide microchannels in a 4×-manifold require a higher pressure of 1,300 mbar compared to the 25-µm-wide SPMC, which in part can also be attributed to the higher fluid veloc-ity given that the mMMC channels (125 µm) are not as deep as in the SPMC (250 µm). These findings demonstrate the need for a carefully optimized geometry of the microchannel and manifold.
Figure 3d shows a clear trend for SPMCs of increased effective base-area-averaged heat-transfer coefficient (heff) for smaller micro-channels. This is due to the combined effect of the increased sur-face area and local heat-transfer coefficient in the fully developed laminar-flow regime. The co-designed 4×-mMMC structures matches this trend with heff = 3.1 × 105 W m−2 K−1, but a large deviation from this pattern is observed when the effective length through which the cool-ant flows in the microchannel is reduced. For the 10×-manifold, heff more than doubles to 7.3 × 105 W m−2 K−1, a rise that can be attributed to the high Nusselt number owing to the developing flow in the MMC structure27,45. This effect becomes more pronounced when consider-ing the wall-area-averaged heat-transfer coefficient (hwall) (Fig. 3e), which eliminates the contribution of the increased surface area from the heat-transfer coefficient, as well as accounts for the limited fin efficiency of the channels. Over a threefold increase in hwall is observed between 25-µm-wide straight microchannels and the 10×-manifold heat sinks, up to 2.4 × 105 W m−2 K−1. This value corresponds to a very high Nusselt number of 16, generally only achieved in larger-scale systems, or in more complex two-phase cooling systems, highlighting the superior thermal performance of this structure.
The combination of improved heat transfer and reduced pressure drop leads to much lower pumping power requirements. The cooling COP is defined as the ratio of extracted power to the pumping power required to provide such a level of cooling, while maintaining a max-imum surface temperature rise of 60 K. Higher heat fluxes require higher flow rates, reducing the COP owing to the larger pumping power required. Figure 3f benchmarks the evaluated devices, along with other technologies found in the literature. For SPMC, channel widths of 100 µm, 50 µm and 25 µm show a consecutively higher COP for higher heat fluxes, with a COP in the range between 102 and 104 and heat fluxes between 350 W cm−2 and 800 W cm−2. The 10×-manifold device vastly outperforms these SPMCs. At an identical COP of 5.0 × 103, the 10×-manifold can sustain heat fluxes up to 1.7 kW cm−2 at 1.0 ml s−1, compared to 400 W cm−2, 450 W cm−2 and 550 W cm−2 for the 100-µm, 50-µm and 25-µm SPMCs, respectively. Furthermore, at a heat flux of 780 W cm−2, the 10×-manifold provides a 50-fold increase in COP with respect to 25-µm SPMCs. Compared to MMC heat sinks presented in the literature, the proposed mMMC device outperforms the current state of the art, and demonstrates a large potential for energy-efficient cooling by having a thermal-centred approach in the device design 

3.Power integrated circuit with embedded cooling:
The lateral nature of AlGaN/GaN electronics enables the monolithic integration of multiple power devices onto a single substrate. This opens up opportunities for power electronics, whereby an entire con-verter can be integrated on a small chip, with large potential for energy, cost and space savings. However, the resulting high heat fluxes limit the maximum output power of the chip. To demonstrate the potential of embedded cooling in a semiconductor device, we monolithically integrated a full-bridge rectifier onto a single GaN-on-Si die. Rectifi-cation was provided using four high-performance tri-anode Schottky barrier diodes with a breakdown voltage of 1.2 kV and high-frequency capability up to 5 MHz (ref. 46). 50-µm-wide cooling channels were integrated on the silicon substrate (Fig. 4a). To fully benefit from the compactness of high-performance microchannel cooling, a three-layer PCB with embedded coolant delivery channels was developed and used to guide the coolant to the device (Fig. 4b). The full fabrication of this monolithically integrated power device and the PCB is described in the Methods and shown in Extended Data Fig. 8. The device was finally fluidically connected to the PCB using laser-cut liquid- and solvent-resistant double-sided adhesive, providing a leak-proof con-nection. This method is low-cost and easy-to-prototype, and translates well to conventional solder bonding. Figure 4c, d shows the converter implemented, with a very compact form factor, rectifying an a.c. signal with peak voltage and current of 150 V and 1.2 A, respectively (Fig. 4e). Integrated liquid cooling led to a small temperature rise of 0.34 K per watt of output power. For a maximum temperature rise of 60 K, this single die can thus produce an output power of 176 W at a flow rate of only 0.8 ml s−1. Furthermore, the reduced operating temperature led to an increased conversion efficiency (Fig. 4f) by eliminating self-heating degradation from the electrical performance. The a.c.–d.c. converter was experimentally evaluated up to 120 W of output power, while the temperature rise stayed below 50 K (Fig. 4g). Considering the small converter volume (4.8 cm3), this corresponds to a high power density of 25 kW dm−3. Moreover, since all cooling occurs within its footprint, multiple devices can be densely packed onto the same PCB to increase the output power. This is a clear benefit over conventional heat sinks relying on heat spreading to large areas. These results show that the proposed high-performance cooling approach can enable the realiza-tion of high-power (kilowatt range) converters of the size of USB sticks in the foreseeable future.

4.Discussion and outlook:
We present an approach for co-designing microfluidics and electronics for energy-efficient cooling, and demonstrate it on GaN-on-Si power devices by turning the passive silicon substrate from a low-cost carrier into a high-performance heat sink. COP values above 10,000 for heat fluxes surpassing 1 kW cm−2 could be obtained by focusing on cooling in an early stage of the device design. As a practical implication, the average added-energy expenditure of more than 30% for cooling in data centres could potentially drop below 0.01% by adopting this design approach. The entire mMMC cooling structure can be monolithically integrated within the substrate, requiring only conventional fabrica-tion procedures, thus making this economically viable. To realize this concept, solutions for the packaging and interconnects are required. The PCB-based fluid delivery presented provides an example of a way to use these co-designed chips, based on components familiar to the electronics designer. This means that, in order to provide maximum energy savings, cooling should be an integral step in the entire elec-tronic design chain, from the device to the PCB design, and not merely an afterthought. If these practicalities can be addressed, we anticipate that the co-design of microfluidic and electronics will be appropri-ate for energy-efficient thermally-aware electronics design. This may aid in solving critical challenges in electronics applications, as well as enabling future integrated power converters on a chip to support the electrification of our society in a sustainable manner.ABSTRACT
An interconnected energy hubs (EHs) framework aims to enhance the efficiency of the multicarrier
energy system through realizing optimal coordination among existing players. In this paper, EH concept
is studied in networked microgrids (MGs) structure to exploit the potential capabilities of microgrids in
satisfying various types of energy demands. In the proposed model, MGs and distribution network are
independent entities which have their local scheduling problem. To coordinate the operation of entities,
a distributed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is exploited to
resolve the conflict of exchanged power between multi-MGs and distribution network. Considering the
uncertainties, a distributed robust model is employed to precisely analyze the performance of multi-
carrier energy networked MGs in different robustness levels. The efficiency of the ADMM model on
integrated energy systems is tested on a networked MGs. The achieved results can ensure the light
computational burden and convergence of proposed distributed algorithm. The proposed EH optimiza-
tion problem is solved via Gurobi optimizer packages. According to the results, the ADMM converges to
the final solution after 5 iterations, and with increasing the robustness level, the operation costs of EHs
increases. The obtained results by Gurobi is more optimal than heuristic algorithms.
1. Introduction
1.1. Motivation and significance
The development of dispatchable and non-dispatchable
renewable energy sources has affected the energy networks and
introduced brand new energy concepts. The energy hub (EH)
concept is one of the important consequences of renewable energy
utilization. The energy hub is a concept by which the energy con-
version, storage and generation can be realized in a higher effi-
ciency. The EH integrates a wide range of energy sources aiming at
increasing a network efficiency and decreasing the energy wasting.
Besides, deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) can
lead a system towards an economical, environmentally friendlyand
flexible network [1]. According to the energy hub concept, various
energy carriers are exploited to satisfy a range of energy demands
at any given time slot [2]. Today’s energy hubs take advantage of
modern technologies such as storage systems, and optimal control
centers for energy management and energy trading purposes.
Considering this capability, the size of EHs can include a wide range
of the energy system depending on demands, infrastructures and
financial budget [3].
The necessity of energy hubs is realized when the optimal
operation of integrated energy systems leads the network toward
efficient utilization of existing energy sources to satisfy different
demands with minimum economic and emission costs [4]. To
achieve optimal operation of multiple EHs, different methods have
been already proposed. In Ref. [5], a mixed integer nonlinear pro-
gramming (MINLP) model is applied for the sake of direct inter-
plant heat integration to make the controllability of energy hubs
flexible when accidentally shutdowns happen; however, the coor-
dination between EHs is not discussed and guaranteed for the large
networks. In Ref. [6], three different schemes are discussed. In the
first one, energy hubs operate independently without any energy
sharing with other entities. In the second scheme, EHs can share
energy with each other through pool-market concept, while the
impact of aggregator can be observed in last scheme in which the
game-theoretic approach based on Stackelberg game is proposed to
solve the energy hub problem in a bilevel scheme. The conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) algorithm is employed in Ref. [7] to ensure the
optimal operation of smart EHs when it comes to a potential risk in
energy hub dailyscheduling. To simplifya complicated EH, Liu et al.
[8] have divided the complicated model to several simple EHs, and
then an approach based on virtual nodes insertion is employed to
solve the EH problem. To ensure the optimal costs of energy hubs, a
probabilistic approach based on Monte Carlo method is used totake
variations of renewable sources into account [9]. Benders decom-
position (BD) algorithm is employed to address the environmental
and social objectives of EHs and decrease the computational
burdenof EH problem [10]. In Ref. [11], the uncertainty dealing with
plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) is modeled using
information gap decision theory (IGDT) to exactly determine the
risk-averse and risk-seeking strategies of the EH. To model the
optimal bidding strategy of energy hub, a stochastic optimization
model is adopted in Ref. [12] to handle the uncertainties associated
with market price and wind energy.
Smart grid technology specifically microgrids (MGs) concept has
changed the reconfiguration of distribution networks and made the
power system sustainable, reliable, and economical [13]. The U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) clearly defines the microgrid as a key
component of smart grid aiming at enhancing reliability, resiliency,
energy efficiency, and quality [14]. Although microgrids have many
technical benefits, they may have some environmental issues,
which should be considered. In Refs. [15], the authors have dis-
cussed the fuel-based and renewables microgrid in Canada.
Nowadays, in Canada, the experts and organizations try to consider
social and environmental benefits of microgrids along with
economical aspects. Besides, the authors in Ref. [16] have consid-
ered the environmental aspects of islanded microgrids by propos-
ing an optimal planning model aiming at decreasing the
environmental issues of microgrids. The concept of the micro en-
ergy grid is employed in Ref. [17] to realize the main goals of EHs
considering the optimal coordination between energy carriers. It
should be mentioned that MGs were previously utilized as a
framework for satisfying the electrical power scheduling in distri-
bution networks. The most important objectives of electrical MGs
are to minimize the operation cost of small-scale energy zones [18],
enhance the resiliency of the grid in case of natural disasters [19],
and increase the reliability [20]. Moreover, in Ref. [21], the stability
issue of microgrids in both interconnected and islanding mode is
improved using large-signal-based control topology for distributed
generator (DG) power converter. The power quality is another
important issue in power systems, which is improved in inter-
connected DC microgrids [22]. In Ref. [23], the authors have used a
two-stage stochastic optimization problem to solve optimal oper-
ation of energy hubs. The proposed solution ensures the optimal
scheduling of energy resources and reserve capacity. Moreover, the
authors have assumed that the limits for energy flows, voltage
magnitudes, and nodal natural gas pressures are in acceptable
range so that the security of the network is guaranteed. In Ref. [24],
EH takes advantage of the generation-storage framework of a
microgrid to ensure the optimal scheduling of multi-energy car-
riers; however, the proposed structure of the MG and EH formu-
lation is simple and the proposed model can face with significant
challenges in larger and multiple interconnected energy entities. In
Ref. [25], AC/DC microgrid is employed to increase the energy
trading between energy providers and consumers through
ensuring efficient energy conversion using a two-stage chance-
constrained bidding scheme. Interconnected MGs are used in
Ref. [26] aiming to optimally coordinate the energy performance of
entities, and a distributed stochastic method is used to solve the
daily scheduling problem which requires a minimum range of in-
formation; however, the performance of proposed method is not
precisely discussed the optimal coordination between MGs in en-
ergy interaction.
1.2. Related works
Several studies have been carried out so far to address the co-
ordinated operation of multiple MGs in which microgrids have
energy interactions with each other through the distribution
network [27]. In Ref. [28], a decent study has been reported on
various energy management systems (EMS) applicable to multi-
MGs, and a new structure based on nested energy management is
presented to ensure the security of each entity and fix the existing
drawbacks of conventional EMSs. In centralized energy manage-
ment system of MGs, EMS aims to optimize the existing objective
function for the entire network [29]. In this type of management
system, all available entities should send their local and private
data and information to the central EMS operator or distribution
network operator (DNO), and then the operation cost of each MG is
optimized by external decision-maker. Therefore, the centralized
energy management system not only cannot guarantee the security
of the entities but also cannot ensure the optimal coordination
between MGs. On the other hand, decentralized energy manage-
ment system of MGs is offered to fix the drawbacks of centralized
EMS when it comes to interconnected operation of networked MGs
[30]. To solve the optimization problem in decentralized mode of
networked MGs, distributed algorithms are needed. In Ref. [31], a
model predictive control (MPC) is employed to optimally manage
the interaction of power among microgrids. Nevertheless, this
technique strongly needs to identify the system model. Besides, the
alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is employed
in Ref. [32] to satisfy optimal power trading between MGs and
distribution network. In Ref. [33], Lagrangian relaxation is used for
decentralizing the isolated MGs so that power exchanging is real-
ized. A non-cooperative game-theoretic approach is employed in
Ref. [34] to guarantee the optimal coordinating control among
multi-MGs. Nevertheless, a few studies have been carried out in
multiple energy carriers networked MGs. The existing studies have
tremendously focused on electrical energy in networked MGs and
paid less attention to other types of energy carriers.
In [35], the authors have utilized an iterative algorithm to
optimally manage the existing DERs. In the proposed algorithm, the
main input data consist of prices, efficiencies, forecasted power
generation of distributed energy resources and load. In other
words, the local controllers should keep the main controller of the
network informed of all data of existing local control centers to
minimize the operation cost of the system. Therefore, the proposed
structure is centralized. In Refs. [23], the authors have taken
advantage of a two-stage stochastic optimization to address the
operation planning of multi-carrier energy systems. In the pro-
posed architecture, a simple microgrid structure without consid-
ering the complicated function of control centers is used in
coordinating the microgrid and main grid. In Ref. [36], an isolated
MG providing the electricity and heating demands is considered.
The proposed structure cannot guarantee the efficiency of the
isolated microgrid in case of lack of electrical and heating energies.
Moreover, meta-heuristics algorithms are employed to optimize
the operation cost of the energy hub. Therefore, the optimal solu-
tion obtained by heuristic algorithms can be doubtful due to local
answers. Similarly, in Ref. [37], a single MG architecture is deployed
to provide the electrical and heating loads of the network. The
proposed energy management system is centralized, which means
that the microgrid operator has access to all data of network loads
and generation level of generators. Therefore, this type of frame-
work can be challenging even after a simple cyberattack, in which
some communication signals can be manipulated to mislead the
optimal scheduling of the microgrid. It should be noted that the
proposed heuristic algorithm may not be able to guarantee the
global minimum for the problem. In Ref. [3], there exists an energy
sharing between energy hubs. The proposed EMS is based on
centralized operation mode. Besides, the authors have utilized a
numerical method, called interior-point to overcome the conver-
gence of the proposed heuristic algorithm to a local minimum.
1.3. Contributions
In this paper, the energy hub concept is realized in a networked
MGs environment. As it was mentioned in the related works, all
studies have been carried out in a centralized operation mode of
energy management system. In other words, the EMS should have
access to data and information of all entities to fulfill an optimal
scheduling of the network. Therefore, the privacy of the entities are
not important in centralized EMS. Besides, the most works in en-
ergy hubs are studied either in regular distribution network
without presence of microgrids or a single microgrid structure in
islanded mode, while in this paper, a networked microgrids
structure is presented, inwhich all MGs are interconnected and can
share energy in a secure and safe environment with least data and
information sharing with distribution network operator.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy reports, microgrids
are the future of smart distribution grids. Additionally, according to
IEEE 1547 Standard, the interconnection and coordination of
distributed resources is critical to create the networked microgrids
structure [38]. Hence, the necessity of power systems studies in
networked microgrids is inevitable. In this paper, multiple energy
carriers networked microgrids is studied to satisfy various energy
demands of the customers. The interdependence of different en-
ergy infrastructures is an inevitable part of modern power systems.
In this regard, networked microgrids can provide a secure, efficient,
reliable, and resilient opportunity to various energy infrastructures
to satisfy the energy demands. Besides, the secured optimal coor-
dination between existing entities can guarantee the energy
preparation at any given time. Due to conventional structure of
distribution grids, providing energy is much more expensive than
networked microgrids framework. In networked microgrids, each
entity can connect to other entities to supply its energy re-
quirements in a distributed operation mode to guarantee the pri-
vacy and optimal energy trading, while in centralized mode or
conventional structures, the main network supervisor has to collect
all data from all existing entities and then optimize the energy
scheduling without considering the privacy of them. To sum up, the
networked microgrids as the future generation of distribution grids
can lead the power systems toward efficient and resilient energy
management, and in this regard, energy hubs concept can be
realized in this architecture considering the optimal operation of
natural gas and electricity infrastructures.
As the power and gas networks are interdependent, the optimal
energy trading between microgrids are inevitable. Compared to the
previous works in interconnected energy hubs, this paper proposes
a distributed method to manage the energy demands in a decen-
tralized operation mode. Therefore, the energy trading will flow
safely between entities, while in centralized mode the control
center of microgrids share all information and data with distribu-
tion network operator. To clarify the main contributions of this
paper, Table 1 is provided to list the most recent published papers
in the energy hub field, and compare the contributions with the
proposed paper.
In the proposed architecture, each MG has its objective function
including electricity, heating, and cooling demands, and each MG
coordinates its operation with the distribution network and other
MGs. Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is
employed to decentralize the daily operation of networked MGs
using a robust optimization method. Therefore, the main contri-
butions of this paper can be categorized as the following:
In this paper, networked microgrids are considered as multi-
energy hubs to satisfy various energy demands. The micro-
grids operate in an interconnected mode to realize the optimal
energy interaction among existing entities. Therefore, this study
exploits the multi-energy interconnection through a decen-
tralized operation mode of MGs, whereas previous studies have
focused more on electrical power interaction among MGs.
A new model is proposed to consider the energy interactions
among microgrids and distribution network. In this regard, a
decentralized energy management system is exploited to opti-
mally respect the ownership of all entities, while the private
information and security of them are realized.
The ADMM is introduced to ensure the privacy and indepen-
dence of the entities. The ADMM-based decentralized solution is
applied to interconnected operation mode of MGs and distri-
bution network to take the various energy interaction among
entities into account. According to the previous studies, the
ADMM model has been employed in those networks in which
only electricity is assumed to be provided.
A distributed robust model is applied to networked MGs
embedded energy hubs. The proposed robust ADMM model
tremendously decreases the computational burden and enjoys
higher convergence.
1.4. Organization
In section 2, the networked MGs structure for interconnected
energy hubs is presented. In section 3, the problem description is
described. In section 4, the distributed robust model of ADMM is
discussed. Finally, in section 5, the simulation results are depicted.
2. Networked microgrids description embedded energy hubs
In the proposed model, there exist two different decision-
makers. The first decision-maker has to do with distribution
network (DN). In this stage, distribution network operator mini-
mizes the cost of the system including generation cost, power
trading cost with the wholesale market, exchanging power cost
with microgrids, energy storage systems, and load interruption
costs considering wholesale market price and distributed energy
resources. The second decision makers are microgrids, in which
each microgrid is informed of the exchanging power of distribution
network with the MG through the existing communication links.
Then, each MG gathers data from the local controllers to optimize
its costs, and finally, the MG informs the distribution network of the
exchanging power between MG and distribution grid. Here, it will
be conflicts between MGs and distribution network in the amount
of exchanging power between the two identities, which this issue is
resolved by ADMM method. The structure of MGs and DN is
depicted as Fig. 1:
In this paper, a multi-carriers energy microgrids are considered
to satisfy the electricity and thermal loads. The proposed energy
hub model enables the sharing of different types of energy between
MGs and distribution network. In the presented model, there are
two entities: multi-microgrids and distribution network. The en-
tities in addition to generating energy through various energy
sources, can share different types of energy with each other to
address the energy demands of costumers. In Fig. 2, a typical
scheme of an EH can be shown.
3. Problem formulation
In this section, the deterministic-based objective function of
each entity is discussed separately.
3.1. Distribution network
As it is shown in Fig. 2, each entity includes two energy inputs to
address the different energy demands of the costumers. The
objective function of distribution network includes two different
parts: electricity, and heating costs. Therefore, the following
objective function can be utilized for distribution grid operation
cost:
The electricity part of distribution network objective function is
affected by electricity input of the energy hub. To supply the elec-
tricity demand of the EH, the objective function consists of elec-
tricity interaction of DN with MGs and wholesale (WS) market, and
charging/discharging state of batteries. Therefore, the electricity
interaction and charging/discharging, load interruption costs along
with the cost of provided electricity for electric chiller are included
in the objective function as following:
In aforementioned equations, the cost dealing with electricity
transaction is mentioned in (3), in which distribution network can
exchange electricity with wholesale market and microgrids. The
purchasing power increases the economic costs of the entity, while
distribution network can get profit through selling surplus elec-
tricity to the MGs and wholesale market. Similarly, battery bank
cost comprises the charging and discharging costs in (4). The
interruption cost is described in (5).
The electrical constraints of the problem for DNare as following:
In (6) and (7), the range of transacted electricity between dis-
tribution network and wholesale market is determined. Similarly,
the electricity interaction limit between distribution network and
each MG is specified in (8) and (9). The charging and discharging
constraints are described in (10) and (11).The constraints dealing
with generation units can be seen in (12)-(15). Finally, constraint
(16) describes the supply-demand balance of distribution network,
which should be guaranteed at any time slot.
It is worthwhile to be mentioned that the energy level of battery
storage system at any given time can be described as follows:
The second term of the proposed objective function for distri-
bution network has to do with gas-related cost. In addition to
electricity, existing EHs have gas input, in which the thermal and
cooling demands are supplied by gas network. Gas input provides
electricity, heating and cooling energies to the EHs. The output of
micro turbines, fuel cells, and diesel generator is electricity while
theyare supplied bygas network input. Besides, combined heat and
power (CHP) units canproduce heating energyas well as electricity,
and the input energy for CHP units is gas as well. Moreover, there
are several gas boilers inside each entity to supply the heating for
the thermal demands. According to the presented energy hub
structure, cooling demands of the entities can be supplied by both
electric chillers which has electricity input, and absorption chiller
which the input energy is gas. Therefore, the objective function
associated with gas energy input can be formulated as below:
In (18), all terms of objective function are shown. As micro
turbines (MTs), fuel cells (FCs), and CHPs are supplied by gas
network, the generation cost of these units is considered in gas
objective function. In this paper, it is assumed that all outputs of
MTs and FCs are electricity. In other words, according to (20) and
(21), the input gas energy is entirely converted to electricity. There
is a diesel generator in distribution network which its generation
cost is described by a quadratic function in (23). The cost dealing
with heating storage systems is shown in (24). In each EH, gas
boilers play an important role in supplying the thermal loads, and
the generated heat cost by gas boilers is formulated as (25). Each
energy hub can interact heating energy with gas network to
guarantee the supply-demand balance. The cost of the heating
transaction is formulated in (26). The heating interruption is
considered in case of lack of enough heating energy, which has the
cost as (27). On the other hand, CHP units have two energy outputs,
electrical energy and heating energy. Therefore, each output of the
CHP can be obtained as follows:
In (28), the electrical contribution of CHP is the value of total
energy output of the unit, while the heating portion of CHP is of the
total output energy in (29).
The heating-related inequality constraints of the problem for
distribution network are similar to electrical part. The inequality
constraints of heating section includes the generation limits of gas
boilers, charging and discharging state of heating storage, heating
energy trading of the entity with the external gas network, and
absorption chiller limits.
The supply-demand balance of heating hub is shown by (30).
3.2. Multi-microgrids
In this paper, each microgrid is considered as an EH which tries
to supply different type of energy demands in any given time.
Similar to distribution network, MGs can address the electricityand
thermal demands using local energy sources, energy storage sys-
tems, and energy interaction with upper level supplier. Microgrids
and distribution network are operating in decentralized mode
meaning that each entity optimizes its objective function without
interference of other entity. So, this operation mode greatly helps
the entities to protect the important data and information and
guarantee the security of them. Likewise, the distribution network,
MGs have to address the electricity and thermal loads at any time
slot.
The electricity part of each MG objective function is influenced
by electricity input of the energy hub. To supply the electricity
demand of each MG, dispatchable and dispatchable generation
units, electrical energy storage systems, and power transaction
between entities are considered. On the other hand, other output of
electricity hub is provided energy for electric chillers. The electrical
objective function of MGs is exactly like distribution network as
mentioned in (2). The costs dealing with electricity transaction,
electrical energy storage, and interruption are formulated like
distribution network (3-5). However, in case of transaction elec-
trical power of each MG, it should be noted that each MG has only
energy interaction with distribution network. Therefore, the elec-
trical power transaction of each MG can be defined as below:
Similar to distribution network inequality constraints, each MG
has the same constraints as (6)-(15). The equality balance of each
MG can be written as below:
The heating-related objective function of each MG is similar to
distribution network mentioned in (18)e(27).The equality heating
balance of each MG can be written as follows:
4. Distributed robust model based on ADMM
4.1. Robust approach
In this paper, the uncertainty dealing with wholesale market
price is modeled using robust optimization. The proposed objective
function can be described as follows:
The proposed objective function considering the robust model
can be formulated as below:
4.2. ADMM model
The prevalent form of objective function and constraint set
which is optimized by ADMM algorithm is as follows:
The augmented Lagrangian function associated with proposed
ADMM algorithm is as below:
As ADMM method is iterative approach, the corresponding it-
erations can be denoted as following:
As it is seen both x and z variables are separately minimized in
an iterative procedure. Therefore, according to (49) and (50), it can
be concluded that ADMM method is appropriate for decentralized
optimization problems. Due to iterative instinct of ADMM, the
approach should be stopped when the following convergence
criteria is fixed:
4.3. ADMM model for networked MGs embedded energy hubs
In this paper, microgrids and distribution network are consid-
ered as separate entities which are willing to interact with each
other from energy standpoint. It should be mentioned that variable
x consists of distribution network variables at any given time spot
as follows:
Similarly, the variable z includes the following variables for each
MG at any given time spot:
In this regard, the augmented Lagrangian function can be
formulated as (54):
As it was mentioned, microgrids and distribution network can
operate in decentralized mode, which means that the operation
cost can be minimized by each entity considering the energy in-
teractions. Considering the decentralized operation of entities,
ADMM is utilized to fix the conflicts of transacted electricity be-
tween each MG and distribution network. The steps of ADMM are
denoted as follows:
In Fig. 3, the flowchart of proposed decentralized model using
ADMM is depicted.
5. Numerical results
The ADMM method is tested in a distribution grid including
networkedmicrogrids with three MGs shownin Fig.1. Each MG and
distribution network operate as an EH which is shown in Fig. 2.
In Table 2 and Table 3, the performance parameters of devices
are listed. The hourly electrical, heating, and cooling demand of all
entities are depicted in Fig. 4.
In the distribution network, diesel generator, MT, FC, CHP,
photovoltaic panel (PV), and wind turbine (WT) are responsible to
provide electrical energy to the entity, while PV, WT, and CHP are
suppliers of electrical power for MG1, and MT, CHP, WT are in
charge of producing electricity for MG2. Besides, PV and CHP are
utilized in MG3 to supply the electricity. In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the
contribution of each power generation unit is shown. In Fig. 5, the
generation level of distribution network and MG1 is depicted. As it
can be observed the diesel generator is utilized when either the
generation level of wind turbine and PV panel is lower or the
electrical demand is higher especially in peak hours. Moreover, in
both distribution network and microgrids entities, the non-
dispatchable generation units including wind turbine and PV
panel have priority in power production. Then, the dispatchable
units are contributed to supply the required power. In other words,
the priorities for power generation are non-dispatchable, dis-
patchable, and diesel generators due to generation costs.
In addition to electrical sector, there exist different units which
are responsible to supply heating for consumers. Gas boilers and
CHP units are considered in heating generation process. The
contribution of gas boilers, CHP, and solar thermal units can be
observed in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 for the entities. It should be mentioned
that MG1 and MG3 can take advantage of solar thermal, as well.
Similar to electrical part, for the heating production, the solar
thermal units are the first priority of entities.
In Fig. 9, the contributions of cooling generation units can be
seen. Absorption chillers (AC) and electric chillers (EC) which are
supplied by gas and electricity, respectively, are utilized to supply
the cooling demand of MGs and distribution network.
Fig. 10 shows the transacted power between MGs and distri-
bution network. As it was mentioned in previous sections, the
ADMM approach is used to coordinate the electrical power inter-
action between entities in a decentralized operation mode. The
optimal results are achieved after 5 iteration which shows the fast
convergence of ADMM.
According to Fig. 10, it can be seen that MGs are willing to
purchase power from distribution network instead selling power to
that entity. It is due to this fact that the internal power generation
units are not able to supply electrical power to their customers.
Also, the Fig.10 describes that the MG2 provides more powers from
energy trading with distribution network compared to other
microgrids due to higher electrical demand of this microgrid. On
the other hand, it is seen that MG1 sells the surplus power to the
distribution network at hour 6 because of surplus generated power.
Totally, the cost of energy trading of MG2 should be more than
other entities.
In Fig.11, the optimal results of distribution network is depicted
for both electrical and heating sectors. Similarly, the optimal out-
puts of microgrids are shownin Figs.12e14. It should be mentioned
that the negative value for exchanged power describes that the
entity is willing to sell power to other entity.
In Fig. 11, In case of electrical operation, the generation level in
distribution network is depicted along with electrical demand. The
amount of energy trading of distribution network with wholesale
market, as well as other microgrids are depicted. In this regard, the
negative amount of energy trading with MGs describes the amount
energy selling to those entities. It is observed that the distribution
network is willing to sell more power to MG2 compared to other
microgrids. Besides, the charging and discharging level of batteries
are shown. From heating point of view, the heating energy gener-
ation using gas network is shown along with heating demand. In
Fig. 11, considering the heating demand, the distribution network
has to connect to external gas company to provide the required
heating energy to the clients. The negative amount of exchanged
heating means that the entity sells heating energy to the gas
company, while the amount of purchased heating energy is
described by positive numbers. It should be mentioned that in peak
hours, the entity requires to purchase energy rather than selling to
gas company. Also, the charging and discharging level of heating
storage systems are shown. Similarly, in Figs.12e14, the generation
level, energy trading, and state of charging are described for elec-
trical and heating purposes of all microgrids.
In Fig. 15, the optimal results for cooling goal of entities are
depicted.
As it is seen in Fig. 15, cooling load interruption can occur in
some hours, which is due to lack of input energy for both electric
chiller and absorption chiller. It is observed that the cooling load
shedding is prevalent in peak hours. It should be noted that cooling
interruption is directly depends on heating and electricity sections.
As an example, there is no cooling load interruption in MG3, which
means that either the load profile is lower or is there enough
electricity and heat in electric and heating hubs.
To analyze the operation cost of entities, Fig. 16 shows the total
operation cost of entities, which is the sum of electricity and gas
inputs. In this figure, the total operation cost is shown for robust-
ness level G 0 ¼ 12. It is seen that the operation cost of distribution
network is more than each microgrid because of higher electrical
and heating demands compared to other entities.
In Table 4, the total operation cost of distribution network is
described considering different robustness level.
As it was estimated, the operation cost increases with increasing
the robustness level. In other words, the system is more conser-
vative once the robustness level goes up. Therefore, when the
robustness level is getting twice, the operation cost of distribution
network increases by 19% which is a significant cost. Besides, to
compare the obtained results by the commercial package, a heu-
ristic algorithm, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) is
employed to validate the optimal solution of proposed method. In
this paper, the obtained results are achieved and optimized by
commercial package (Gurobi optimizer package) and then
compared with PSO in centralized and distributed operation
modes. The achieved operation cost by Gurobi optimizer package is
reliable and optimal compared to PSO. The reason is that the
heuristic algorithms obtain local optimal solutions rather than
global answers.
To show the performance of ADMM, the operation cost of dis-
tribution network is depicted in Fig. 17 for each iteration at
robustness level 12.
According to Fig. 17, the fast convergence of ADMM can be seen
for the operation cost of distribution network. ADMM can reach to
the optimal cost after 5 iterations. Besides, In Fig. 18, the residual
value of problem which is described as step 4 of ADMM in (57) is
depicted. The rapid convergence of the method can be clearly seen.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, optimal operation of networked MGs embedded
interconnected energy hubs was discussed. A distributed robust
model was proposed to optimally coordinate the power trading
between microgrids and distribution network. A robust optimiza-
tion method is employed to analyze the impact of uncertainty
associated with wholesale market price. In this study, networked
MGs and distribution network were assumed to be independent
entities aiming at minimizing their own operation cost while the
privacy and security of entities are realized. To coordinate the
exchanged energy between MGs and distribution network, ADMM
is exploited to settle the conflicts of entities. The main goal of this
study was applying ADMM model to interconnected energy hubs to
show the strength of this distributed algorithm in coordinating the
existing conflict between entities. The achieved results proved this
fact that the convergence of ADMM model is significant and can
rapidly reach the optimal results in less iterations. Comparing the
obtained result by the proposed distributed algorithm with
centralized model shows the accuracy of the presented method.
Also, the optimality of proposed optimization method solved by
Gurobi solver is compared with a heuristic algorithm tovalidate the
accuracy. In the proposed problem, the obtained results by Gurobi
solver is better than heuristic algorithm. Distributionally robust
optimization model based on ADMM considering demand response
programs can be considered for optimal operation analysis of net-
worked MGs embedded EHs in future works.Heat pipe dryout and temperature hysteresis in response to transient heat pulses exceeding the capillary limit

Abstract:
The balance between the capillary pressure provided by the wick in a heat pipe or vapor chamber and the ﬂow resistance to liquid resupply at the evaporator determines the maximum heat load that can be sustained at steady state. This maximum heat load is termed as the capillary limit; operation at steady heat loads above the capillary limit will result in dryout at the evaporator wick. However, different user
needs and device workloads can lead to highly transient heat loads in applications ranging from con- sumer electronic devices to server processors. In these instances, the operation of heat pipes must be assessed in response to brief transient heat loads which could be higher than the notional capillary limit that governs dryout at steady state. In the current study, experiments are performed to characterize the
transient thermal response of a heat pipe subjected to heat input pulses of varying duration that ex- ceed the capillary limit. Transient dryout events due to a wick pressure drop exceeding the maximum available capillary pressure can be detected from an analysis of the measured temperature signatures. It is demonstrated that under such transient heating conditions, a heat pipe can sustain heat loads higher than the steady-state capillary limit for brief periods of time without experiencing dryout. If the heating
pulse is suﬃciently long as to induce transient dryout, the heat pipe may experience an elevated steady- state temperature even after the heat load is reduced back to a level lower than the capillary limit. The steady-state heat load must then be reduced to a level much below the capillary limit to fully recover the original thermal resistance of the heat pipe. This characteristic temperature hysteresis following tran- sient dryout has signiﬁcant implications for the use of heat pipes for pulsed power dissipation. Further experiments are performed to bound the range of heat loads over which the temperature hysteresis is present following a transient dryout event.

1.Introduction:
Heat pipes and vapor chambers utilize the latent heat of phase change of an internal working ﬂuid to passively transport heat over long distances at a small temperature gradient. Heat pipes ﬁnd use in thermal management of electronic devices in both low- and high-power applications owing to their eﬃcient heat transport [1–3].  
The hollow metal case of a heat pipe is lined on the inside by a porous wick that is saturated with liquid; the interior core of the heat pipe supports vapor ﬂow [4].  A local heat source is applied to the evaporator region of the heat pipe, and the surface dedicated for heat rejection to the ambient is called the condenser. Application of a heat input causes the liquid to evaporate at the wick and ﬂow through the vapor core. The vapor condenses on the wick that lines the condenser surface and is passively drawn back to the evaporator via capillary forces generated in the wick. An increase in the heat input increases the rate of evaporation from the wick, and induces a higher ﬂuid ﬂow rate and pressure drop in the heat pipe. The maximum heat load that a heat pipe can sustain at steady state while maintaining liquid resupply to the evaporator is governed by the capillary pressure of the wick. Any heat load inducing a ﬂuid pressure drop higher than the capillary pressure head will result in dryout at the evaporator wick; this threshold heat load is commonly known as the capillary limit. 
The capillary limit, which governs the maximum steady-state heat load, is primarily dependent on the heat pipe geometry, working ﬂuid properties, and wick properties. Working ﬂuids are typically chosen based on thermophysical liquid properties that would yield the maximum capillary limit [5,6].  Recent studies have explored the use of ﬂuid additives [7,8] to increase the maximum 
heat transport rate in heat pipes. A number of studies have inves- tigated the capillary limit-induced dryout phenomenon in porous wick structures in heat pipes. Hanlon and Ma [9] characterized the dependence of dryout heat ﬂux in sintered particle structures on wick thickness, particle size, and porosity. Chun [10] studied the dryout of screen wicks pumping vertically against gravity, and developed a model to predict the dryout heat load as a function of the wicking length. For screen mesh wicks, Brautsch and Kew [11] showed that the heat ﬂux required for dryout increases with an increasing number of mesh layers. A model for steady-state temperature and pressure drop in a ﬂat heat pipe developed by Lefevere and Lallemand [12] was used to show that the maximum heat ﬂux of a grooved heat pipe increases with an increase in the groove width [13]. 
Rather than considering the individual effects of the working ﬂuid and wick on performance, several studies have characterized the coupling between the capillary behavior and different gov- 
erning parameters of vapor chambers and heat pipes. Rice and Faghri [14] numerically simulated the temperature and pressure ﬁelds in sintered wick heat pipes, accounting for changes in menis- cus shape due to evaporation as a function of applied heat load and location of the heat source. The parametric dependence of heat 
pipe performance on wick properties (thickness, radius of curva- ture, porosity) and heater diameter was investigated by Pruzan et  al. [15];  the physical insights from the study were used to de- 
sign wicks capable of dissipating high heat loads. Other physical mechanisms, such as the effect of viscous drag along the wick substrate on liquid ﬂow in a wick [16] and heat spreading in the 
wall/wick from localized heat sources [17] can also have a promi- nent effect on the capillary limit of a heat pipe. Fluid loading in the wick also affects the capillary limit. Kempers et al. [18] showed that capillary limit was unaffected by over-ﬁlling the wick, but greatly diminished due to under-ﬁlling. In another study, Lips et al. [19] showed that a thinner vapor core improves the thermal resistance but reduces the capillary limit for an over-ﬁlled wick, and hence the vapor core thickness and ﬁlling ratio need to be carefully optimized. In our recent work [20],  we concluded that 
the choice of wick and working ﬂuid should Lips et al. [19] showed that a thinner vapor core improves the thermal resistance but reduces the capillary limit for an over-ﬁlled wick, and hence the vapor core thickness and ﬁlling ratio need to be carefully optimized. In our recent work [20],  we concluded that 
the choice of wick and working ﬂuid should be made simulta- neously to obtain the optimal thermal performance while utiliz- ing the maximum capillary pressure available, as the total thermal 
resistance is coupled to both the wick and working ﬂuid proper- ties. 
understand dryout mechanisms at steady-state operating condi- tions. However, electronic devices are rarely operated in a steady manner in practice, but rather, the operation is highly transient. For instance, in smartphones, the typical user behavior consisting of short periods of device interaction is well recognized in the literature [21] and is often referred to as ‘bursty’ or micro-usage [22,23].  These micro-usage device interaction patterns are also common in other applications, such as user activity on the internet [24] or while streaming media content [25].  For both low- and high-power applications, thermal design and thermally-limited performance throttling is increasingly dictated by such transient use-cases, often including short power spikes [26,27].  Hence, it is important to study the dryout behavior of heat pipes in response to a brief power pulse that exceeds the conventional capillary limit value at steady state.
A number of studies have investigated the thermal and hydro- dynamic response of vapor chambers and heat pipes under tran- sient operating conditions. A seminal example by Tournier and El-Genk [28] is a two-dimensional transient model of a heat pipe that predicted the effective radii of curvature of the liquid menisci 
along the liquid-vapor interface, in response to step-function heat- ing and cooling. Wang and Vafai [29] experimentally investigated the thermal performance of a ﬂat-plate heat pipe and proposed a heat pipe time constant. A model was developed [30] which indicated that the thermal penetration time is dependent on the effective thermal diffusivity along the heat pipe; the time to steady state is strongly dependent on the heat transfer coeﬃcient to the ambient. Several studies have also benchmarked the transient performance of ﬂat heat pipes against solid metal heat spreaders. Harmand et al. [31] compared vapor chambers against solid heat spreaders in terms of total thermal resistance using a transient numerical model, and found solid heat spreaders to have lower temperature gradients than vapor chambers for short transient thermal cycles. Recently, Patankar et al. [32] investigated the physical mechanisms governing vapor chamber performance under transient operating conditions, using an experimentally validated time-stepping analytical model [33].  The maximum temperature in a solid heat spreader was found to be lower than the vapor chamber for short periods of time just after start-up owing to the low relative thermal capacity of the vapor chamber. At later times, the vapor chamber performed better than the solid spreader as the operating temperature and effective vapor core conductance increased. Other factors such as wick ﬁlling ratio, gravity, heat ﬂux, and convective cooling can also affect the transient performance 
of a heat pipe [34].  However, these prior studies have only charac- terized the transient operating characteristics; to the knowledge of the authors, none have focused on the transient thermal behavior up to the point of dryout or above the steady-state capillary limit. 
In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that a heat pipe can brieﬂy operate, without the occurrence of dryout, at heat loads higher than the value corresponding to the steady-state capillary limit. Furthermore, the response of the heat pipe to a pulsed heat load above this notional capillary limit is characterized to assess the thermal signatures of the dryout phenomenon under such transient conditions. A threshold time-to-dryout corresponding to the applied heating pulse power is identiﬁed; pulse durations exceeding time-to-dryout are shown to cause dryout. Hysteresis in the heat pipe temperature is observed following dryout. That is, if dryout occurs, the heat load must be reduced to a level signiﬁcantly lower than the capillary limit in order to fully recover the original performance. 

2. Experimental setup：
A schematic diagram of the experimental facility used to characterize the heat pipe transient thermal behavior is shown in 
Fig. 1.  The setup was designed to isolate the heat pipe from exter- nal components or materials (such as insulation) that would add thermal capacity and affect the transient thermal response in an experiment. The heat pipe sample used in this study was 150 mm long, 9 mm wide, and 0.62 mm thick (Novark Technologies). The two ends of the heat pipe have a solid copper cross section, such that the effective length of the heat pipe having a vapor 
core is 120 mm. The heat pipe was suspended in air by hang- 
ing from long, thin steel wires to minimize heat losses through this pathway. The left end of the heat pipe was covered with a layer of polyimide tape over a length of 8 mm, and a sheathed Nichrome wire wrapped on top to form a heater. Thermal grease (OMEGATHERM 201) was applied between the heater wire and polyimide surface. Power input to the heater was controlled using a programmable power supply (Korad KA3005P) to induce Joule heating. The supply current was calculated by measuring the voltage drop across a shunt resistor (0.01 􀀁); the voltage drop across the Nichrome wires was measured directly. 
Temperatures were measured along the length of the heat pipe using T-type thermocouples at the locations shown in Fig. 1.  The thermocouple beads labeled B were attached to the outer surface of the heat pipe using small pieces of copper tape. To measure 
the temperature at the evaporator, thermocouple A1 was sand- 
wiched between the polyimide tape and heat pipe surface. The thermocouples were all calibrated in a dry block calibrator (Jupiter Isotech 4852) using the same procedure that was previously demonstrated to yield an uncertainty of ±0.3 K [35].  The reference temperature for the thermocouples during the calibration and the experiment was maintained near 0° C using an ice-point reference (OMEGA CL122). The temperatures of the ice-point junction and the ambient were measured using RTDs. The temperature measurements were acquired using a data ac- quisition chassis (National Instruments (NI) cDAQ–9178) equipped 
with thermocouple (NI–9214) and RTD (NI–9217) modules. Volt- ages were measured using a separate data acquisition unit (NI USB–6255). Data were recorded using a LabVIEW interface at 4 Hz. 
Heat dissipation to the ambient was facilitated by placement of two fans that blow ambient air over the heat pipe, with the air ﬂow direction as indicated in Fig. 1.  The heat transfer coeﬃcient via forced convection cooling was estimated by performing an analogous experiment with a solid copper ﬁn of length 150 mm, width 8.6 mm, and thickness 2.4 mm, and ﬁtting the measured temperature readings to an analytical solution. The heat transfer coeﬃcient was found to be in the range of 85–110 W/m 2 -K for input powers from 1 W to 7 W. This analog experiment also enabled estimation of the net heat input to the ﬁn, which was found to be in agreement with the measured electrical heat input, showing that the heat loss from the heater was small. Speciﬁcally, the difference between electrical input and measured heat load dissipated from the ﬁn was ~9% at lower powers (1 W to 2 W), and ~5% at higher powers. Heat losses are therefore neglected during testing of the heat pipe. 

3. Results and discussion：
The following subsections discuss a series of experiments that were performed to identify the response of a heat pipe subjected 
to transient heat loads exceeding the capillary limit. Each subsec- 
tion brieﬂy presents the experimental test procedure, followed by a detailed discussion of the results. 
Prior to investigating the transient thermal response of the heat pipe sample, the steady-state thermal performance is benchmarked and compared to that of a solid copper ﬁn 
(150 mm × 8.6 mm × 1.6 mm) under identical boundary con- ditions. A given heat load is applied to the sample (heat pipe or copper ﬁn), and the system is allowed to reach steady state. Steady state is deﬁned as when the standard deviation in the time-averaged temperature of all thermocouple measurements over 37.5 s is less than ~0.05° C. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of steady-state temperature proﬁles along the length of the heat pipe and copper ﬁn for two different power levels (2 W and 5 W).The heat source extends from 0 to 8 mm, as indicated by the shaded region in the ﬁgure. The temperatures are obtained from point A1 within the heated region and from B1 to B6 along the exposed length. At both power levels, the maximum temperature in the heated region (A1) is lower for the heat pipe as compared to the copper ﬁn, and the temperature proﬁle (B1-B6) is more uniform. This temperature uniformity over the heat pipe surface is a result of effective heat transport through the vapor core at a small temperature gradient [36].  
The steady-state capillary limit is found by measuring the temperatures along the heat pipe at increasing heat loads from 1 W to 5.2 W. The heat load is increased in small increments, and the heat pipe is allowed to reach a steady state at each heat input. When the heat load is increased from 5.1 W to 5.2 W, a sharp increase in the evaporator temperature and a momentary decrease in condenser temperature is observed, indicating that a dryout has occurred. Hence, 5.1 W is identiﬁed as the maximum heat load that can be supplied at steady state to the heat pipe sample under the test boundary conditions without the occurrence of dryout (i.e., it is the steady-state capillary limit of the heat pipe). 

3.1. Transient dryout in response to a power pulse exceeding the steady-state capillary limit ：
The thermal response of the heat pipe to a power pulse input is shown in Fig. 3.  The heat pipe is initially operated at a steady- state power of 3 W, as shown in the temporal heat load proﬁle of Fig. 3 (a). At t = 0 s, the power input to the heat pipe is suddenly increased to 10 W, which is higher than the measured steady-state capillary limit (5.1 W). The power input is maintained at 10 W for approximately 10 s, after which it is reduced to 3 W. 
Fig. 3 (b) shows the corresponding temporal variation in the evaporator temperature at location A1 in response to this transient power pulse. The temperature is initially steady at 48.5° C when the power input is 3 W. At t = 0 s, the evaporator experiences a sharp temperature rise due to the increase in power input to 10 W. The evaporator temperature increases monotonically throughout the 10 s long pulse, during which an inﬂection is observed at t = 5.25 s. Appearance of this inﬂection in the temperature at the evaporator indicates that a dryout event has occurred due to insuﬃcient liquid supply by capillary action. A more distinct temperature signature is observed in Fig. 3 (c), which shows the variation of the condenser temperature with time. At the start of the power pulse (t  = 0 s), the condenser temperature increases 
monotonically until t = 5.25 s. At this point in time, the temper- 
ature proﬁle begins to ﬂatten out and a plateau is observed. The temperature dips momentarily, and then starts to increase again. This occurrence of a plateau in the temperature response at the condenser also indicates the occurrence of dryout. Dryout at the evaporator is immediately reﬂected in the condenser temperature response because of the very short time scales associated with diffusion in the vapor core. 
The occurrence of an inﬂection point in the evaporator tem- perature at the point of dryout, along with the plateau in the condenser proﬁle, is attributed to a transition in the primary heat transfer pathway before and after dryout, as discussed further in Ref. [37].  Heat transfer before dryout is primarily due to phase change at the evaporator, while heat conduction in the wall is the primary heat transfer pathway after dryout. The time at which dryout occurs, termed here as the time-to-dryout, is 5.25 s from the time the power input is increased. 
At the end of the power pulse, the power input is dropped back to 3 W and the heat pipe is allowed to reach steady state. The new steady-state evaporator temperature attained by the heat pipe after the power pulse has ended is a further indication that dryout has occurred during the pulse. It is observed from Fig. 3 (b) that the steady-state evaporator temperature after the power pulse (t  > ~80 s) is ~12° C higher than the initial temperature at the same steady power input of 3 W before the pulse input (t  < 0 s). We attribute the presence of this temperature hysteresis to the characteristic hysteresis in the rewetting process of the wick after a dry patch has formed [38–40].  Thus, we infer that the temperature hysteresis observed before and after the power pulse ( Fig. 3 (b)) is due to the occurrence of transient dryout of the heat pipe at t = 5.25 s. 

3.2. Temperature hysteresis after the occurrence of transient dryout ：
Hysteresis in the evaporator temperature after a power pulse indicates that a transient dryout event has occurred in the heat pipe. The dryout occurs due to wick pressure drop exceeding the 
available capillary pressure during the power pulse at the time-to- dryout. In this section, the duration of the power pulse is varied to determine its effect on the hysteresis behavior. Fig. 4 shows the thermal response of a heat pipe operated under heating pulse durations of 4 s, 10 s, 14 s, and 16 s. The heat pipe is initialized at a power of 3 W (t  < 0), pulsed above the capillary limit to 7 W for the different durations, and reduced back to 3 W, as shown in the load proﬁles in Fig. 4 (a). The evaporator temperature proﬁles corresponding to each of these four different pulse durations is plotted in Fig. 4 (b). 
For the shortest 7 W pulse duration of 4 s, no inﬂection is observed in the evaporator temperature during the power pulse (blue curve; Fig. 4 (b)). Moreover, the evaporator temperature does not exhibit any observable temperature hysteresis after the pulsed loading ends; the steady-state evaporator temperature measured after the pulse ends and the heat input reverts to 3 W (t  > ~40 s) is the same as it was before the pulse (t  < 0). The absence of an inﬂection in the evaporator temperature during the pulse or of any temperature hysteresis indicates that the heat pipe did not undergo dryout. 
It is noted that the heat pipe operated without the occurrence of dryout or any hysteresis for a brief period of time at a heat load (7 W) that is higher than the notional steady-state capillary limit (5.1 W). The ability of the heat pipe to operate above the capillary limit without experiencing dryout results from the lag 
between the thermal/hydrodynamic response and the heat in- crease. Based on the mechanisms governing transient performance of a heat pipe [32],  the effective in-plane diffusivity governs the time required for the temperature proﬁle to develop at the start of the transient load. A higher in-plane diffusivity would lead to a quicker thermal and hydrodynamic proﬁle development, and thus, a shorter time-to-dryout in response to a pulse load input. time-to-dryout, the heat pipe undergoes dryout and exhibits tem- perature hysteresis at the evaporator upon a return to the lower steady-state heat input. From Fig. 4 (b), it is observed that the hysteresis in the evaporator temperature increases in magnitude with an increase in pulse duration longer than the time-to-dryout. The difference in temperature at the 3 W input before and after the power pulse is 4° C for a pulse duration of 10 s, and increases  to 10° C for a pulse duration of 14 s. However, as the pulse duration further increases, the temperature hysteresis asymptotes towards a maximum value. With an increase in pulse duration from 14 s and 16 s, the magnitude of temperature hysteresis remains at ~10° C, and does not increase any further with longer pulses. 
For a heating pulse from a 3 W base to 7 W, evaporator temperature hysteresis was found to occur after transient dryout. However, the occurrence of a transient dryout is not necessarily accompanied by hysteresis after the power pulse ends; instead the occurrence of hysteresis depends on the characteristics of the power pulse. For example, the cases in Fig. 5 (a) explore a different power pulse proﬁle initialized at a lower steady-state power input of 2 W (t  < 0), and pulsed to the same increased load of 7 W for durations of 14 s, 16 s, 18 s, and 20 s. All of these pulse durations 
are longer than the time-to-dryout, as Fig. 5 (b) reveals an inﬂec- tion in the evaporator temperature response at t = 9.75 s, the time at which dryout occurs for all cases. Interestingly, with the lower baseline (steady-state) power of 2 W, the evaporator recovers to 
the same temperature after the pulse, without any observable hys- teresis in temperature, even though the pulse duration exceeded the time-to-dryout and transient dryout occurred. The presence of temperature hysteresis at the baseline load of 3 W, and its absence at 2 W, suggests that the steady-state operating power governs the 
recovery of the heat pipe after the dryout. Therefore, the next sec- tion investigates the temperature hysteresis under steady state op- eration, to probe whether the steady state performance character- istics can be used to explain the recovery after a transient dryout. 

3.3. Post-dryout temperature hysteresis envelope under steady operation ：
To investigate the steady-state temperature hysteresis behavior of a heat pipe after dryout at the capillary limit, the heat pipe sample is ﬁrst subjected to increasing steady power inputs until dryout occurs. During this powering-up procedure, the heat load is incremented by small, ﬁnite amounts; the increment is 0.5 W at low heat loads (1 W to 4 W) and is reduced to 0.1 W as the heat load approaches the capillary limit of 5.1 W. At each input heat load, the heat pipe is allowed to reach a steady state. After reaching the capillary limit, the temperature is allowed to reach steady state in the dried-out condition, and the power is further 
increased to 5.4 W by a small amount to complete the powering- up procedure. From this dried-out condition above the capillary limit, the heat load to the heat pipe is then decreased from 5.4 W following a powering-down procedure during which the power is reduced in small decrements back to the initial condition, again allowing steady state to be reached at each power. Fig. 6 traces the variation of the steady-state evaporator temperature (location A1) with increasing and deceasing input heat load along these powering-up (black) and powering-down (gray) pathways. 
During the powering-up procedure, the evaporator temperature increases with an increase in heat load (1 W to 5.1 W) as expected. When the heat load is incremented from 5.1 W to 5.2 W, a sharp increase in evaporator temperature is observed. The steady-state evaporator temperature rises from 58° C at 5.1 W to 83° C at 5.2 W. This sharp rise is due to an increase in total thermal resistance of the heat pipe after the dryout, and indicates that the heat pipe has reached its capillary limit. The hysteresis in the steady-state evaporator temperature after dryout is clearly evident from Fig. 6.  During the powering-down trace from 5.4 W, the evaporator has a markedly higher temperature than measured at the same heat loads during the powering-up trace. This temperature discrepancy (i.e., severity of the temperature hysteresis) gradually reduces as the heat load is decreased, until there is ultimately no observable temperature difference at a power of 2 W. 

3.4. Discussion ：
In Section 3.2,  we demonstrated that there is signiﬁcant tem- perature hysteresis before and after a transient dryout event when the heat pipe is pulsed from 3 W to a heat load of 7 W (exceeding the capillary limit of 5.1 W), and then returned to 3 W. However, when pulsing to the same 7 W pulse but initialized from a lower 
baseline power of 2 W, there is no observable temperature hystere- sis after transient dryout. In Section 3.3,  the temperature hysteresis 
after dryout is characterized under steady-state operating condi- 
tions by decreasing the power after the heat pipe has reached its capillary limit. These experiments revealed that the temperature hysteresis is observed only for heat loads above 2 W. The absence of temperature hysteresis at 2 W –both in cases of dryout caused by a transient power pulse ( Fig. 5)  and when reached by steadily powering down from above the capillary limit – indicates that 
the envelope of temperature hysteresis under steady-state condi- tions ( Fig. 6)  may serve to bound the input power range in which 
hysteresis would be observed after the occurrence of dryout. In ad- 
dition, the severity of the temperature hysteresis at a given power appears to be bounded by the steady-state operation of the heat pipe after the capillary limit has been reached, as illustrated by the 
magnitude of temperature hysteresis at 3 W. In Fig. 6,  the mag- nitude of temperature difference between the powering-up and powering-down traces at 3 W is ~14° C. This temperature difference is comparable to the upper limit of temperature hysteresis (~10° C) observed after transient dryout when pulsing from 3 W to a heat load above the capillary limit and returning back to 3 W ( Fig. 4 ).  Based on these observations, we speculate that the temperature hysteresis range and severity (magnitude) in Fig. 6,  measured at steady-state by incrementally powering down the head load, is a  bounding envelope. Moreover, the maximum heat load for which no hysteresis is observed after steady-state dryout (~2 W for the present case) represents a critical threshold below which the heat pipe must be operated in order to recover its original performance, if an unintended transient dryout event were to occur. 

4. Conclusions：
In this study, we explored the transient response of a heat pipe to pulsed heat load inputs above the notional capillary limit. From the series of experiments, we conclude that: 
1 A heat pipe can operate for brief periods of time at heat loads higher than its capillary limit at steady state, without the occurrence of dryout. 
2 In response to a power pulse exceeding the steady-state cap- illary limit, we measured a time-to-dryout at which the heat pipe experiences dryout. 
3 Operation longer than the time-to-dryout for a power pulse higher than the capillary limit may lead to hysteresis in temperature at the evaporator (i.e., the temperature will not recover back to its original magnitude even after the power is reduced back to the pre-pulse level). 
4 The magnitude of temperature hysteresis observed by allowing a heat pipe to reach steady state after the capillary limit has been exceeded serves as the limiting (maximum) severity for the temperature hysteresis observed after transient dryout in response to a power pulse. 
5 A threshold heat load exists below which the heat pipe does not exhibit any temperature hysteresis after dryout; this may represent a critical power that the heat pipe must drop below in order to fully recover performance after a dryout event. 

Mathematical modelling of a diesel common-rail system
In diesel common-rail systems, the exact knowledge of the injection pressure is important to accurately control the injected diesel mass and thus the combustion process. This paper focuses on the mathematical modelling of the hydraulic and mechanical components of a common-rail system in order to describe the dynamics of the diesel rail pressure. Based on this model, an average model is derived to reduce the model complexity and to allow for a fast calculation of the mass flow into the rail for different crank shaft revolution speeds and openings of the fuel metering unit. The main purpose of this average model is to serve as a basis for a model-based (non-linear) controller design. The stationary accuracy of the models is validated by means of measurement data.

1. Introduction
Common-rail injection technology is typically used in modern diesel engines. The major advantage compared to prior injection systems, e.g. in-line injection pumps, is that the process of injection and high-pressure generation is decoupled. This enables injections with arbitrary timing and quantity, even so-called multiple injections, which can significantly increase the efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions of the engine [[ 1]].
Figure 1 depicts a schematic diagram of the considered common-rail injection system. The central component of the system is a rail volume filled with highly pressurized diesel, which delivers diesel to the injectors. By opening and closing the injectors, the desired amount of diesel can be injected into the combustion chambers of the engine. The high pressure in the rail is generated by a radial piston pump, which is actuated by one or more eccentrics at the camshaft of the engine. The amount of diesel flow into the radial piston pump can be controlled by an electromagnetically actuated variable displacement valve (fuel metering unit, FMU). The FMU is supplied by a constant pressure, which is generated by a gear pump and an overflow valve. Due to leakages in the FMU, it is necessary to install a zero delivery throttle, which enables zero volume flows of the radial piston pump. In many configurations, a pressure control valve (PCV) is installed in the rail to transport diesel from the rail to the tank and thus to actively reduce the rail pressure.
Accurately controlling the rail pressure is an important prerequisite to achieve the desired quantity of fuel injected. Mathematical models provide the basis for the analysis of the dynamical behaviour and the design of control strategies. Stationary characteristic maps are frequently used to describe the system behaviour. These models must be calibrated by measurements and do not account for the dynamical behaviour. These models are thus not directly applicable for the controller design. First-principle models are more suitable for this purpose.
Graph: Figure 1. Schematic diagram of a common-rail system.
The authors of [[ 2]] developed a model of a diesel injection system, where the focus was set on the injection process itself. The models developed in [[ 3]] concentrate on a detailed description of the rail and the injection process as well. In [[ 4]], models of common-rail systems are presented which were primarily intended for the control design. These models are characterized by a low dimension and are based on a number of simplifications, which neglect some important effects, e.g. of the dynamics of the radial piston pump. Moreover, [[ 2], [ 4]] do not consider an FMU such that the models are not suitable for the considered common-rail system. The authors of [[ 6]] include the FMU in their model but do not consider a physics-based model of the radial piston pump. A more detailed model is given in [[ 8]] where a hybrid model for the common-rail system is developed. Although an approach for the description of cavitation in the radial piston pump is presented, a measured curve is utilized to describe the flow rate of the radial piston pump as a function of the current of the FMU.
Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop a mathematical model of the common-rail system which ( 1) allows for a fast and yet accurate simulation of the dynamical behaviour and ( 2) which can be easily parameterized by means of construction parameters of the system. Section 2 summarizes the mathematical equations of this model and gives some simulation results. A comparison with measurements shows that the model is capable of accurately reproducing the real system behaviour. Due to its complexity, this model is, however, not directly applicable to design a controller. Thus, a reduced model of the system is developed in Section 3, which is based on averaging the system variables over one cycle of the piston motion of the radial piston pump. Simulation results show that the reduced model still exhibits a high accuracy and captures the essential dynamical behaviour of the system.
2. Detailed model
In this section, a detailed mathematical model of the common-rail system is derived. This model is based on the following assumptions and simplifications:

The pressure at the high-pressure side of the FMU is kept almost constant by means of the overflow valve. Thus, models of the gear pump and the overflow valve are not required. Instead, a constant pressure is presumed.

The effect of zero diesel flow for closed FMU, which is achieved by the zero delivery throttle in the real system, is approximated by an idealized FMU without leakage flow.

In this paper, a common-rail system without PCV is considered. This is a common configuration in cost-sensitive applications. The control of the rail pressure is thus only achieved by means of the FMU.
The exact time evolution of the injected diesel flow into the cylinders of the internal combustion engine strongly depends on the actual load of the engine. The model presented in this paper is primary developed for the design of a controller for the rail pressure. As will be seen later, it is not possible to influence the fast pressure fluctuations in the rail caused by the injection process. Therefore, a simplified model will be given, which, however, captures the main effects of the injection process.
2.1. Isentropic fluid model
Diesel pressure in a common-rail system varies from lower than atmospheric pressure (e.g. in the cylinders of the radial piston pump) to very high pressures in the rail. At pressures lower than vapour pressure, the fluid starts to vaporize. Moreover, the compressibility of diesel considerably decreases for high pressures. As these effects cause significant changes in the fluid properties, a model that describes the fluid for both cavitation and high-pressure cases is strived for, see also [[ 9]].
The subsequent model is based on an isentropic fluid, where the mass density and the bulk modulus (both depending on the pressure p) meet the relation
( 1)
Graph
To characterize diesel depending on its pressure p, three cases are distinguished:

Diesel at pressures higher than the upper vapour pressure , , is liquid.

In the pressure range diesel starts to vaporize, i.e. there is some liquid and some vapour part.

At pressures lower than the lower vapour pressure , , all diesel mass is vaporized.

The next sections deal with these three cases in detail and provide equations for and .
2.1.1. Case 1: p ≥ p vap,u
When describing fluids at moderate pressures, a constant bulk modulus can be used, see, e.g. [[11]]. However, for diesel pressures in a common-rail system, which can increase beyond 2000 bar, an increasing bulk modulus is observed in measurements, see Figure 2.[ 1] The bulk modulus is described as

In this case, the fluid is considered to be partly liquid and partly vaporized. Given the overall mass m, let us consider that a mass fraction is vaporized, while the mass fraction is still liquid. It is assumed that all fluid is liquid at , i.e. , and all fluid is vaporized at , i.e. . In general, the vaporized fraction is a non-linear function of the pressure p. In this work, it is supposed that increases linearly with decreasing pressure, see, e.g. [[ 9], [11]],

The variable area is given as a function of the position of the valve spool. Since the opening area exhibits a triangular shape, increases quadratically with , see Figure 5. The movement of the valve spool is controlled by a solenoid, generating the (positive) magnetic force . The restoring force is due to a preloaded spring with stiffness . The mechanical system of the FMU can be described by

The preload of the spring is chosen as the position which corresponds to the maximum mass flow. The position is limited within the mechanical stops .

and outside these stops, the motion is governed by Equation (15).
The magnetic force is generated by a solenoid, where the force is a function of both the position and the current applied to the electromagnet of the FMU. The current is controlled by a subordinate current controller such that the setpoint of the current serves as the control input to the system. An analytic model of the overall dynamics of the solenoid, including the current controller, is not meaningful due to the resulting complexity. Instead, the dynamics of the current-controlled solenoid is approximated by a first-order lag element with the time constant in the form

2.3. Gallery volume
The mass flow of the FMU, Equation (13), is delivered into the small gallery volume between FMU and radial piston pump. The diesel mass flow out of is the sum of all flows into the cylinders of the radial piston pump. Therefore, the pressure is given by the balance of mass

2.4. Radial piston pump
The radial piston pump delivers diesel into the rail by a periodic motion of the pistons. Starting at the top dead centre (TDC), the cylinder volume is increased due to the downward motion of the piston and the diesel in the cylinder is expanded until the inlet (suction) valve, SV in Figure 1, opens. Then, diesel flows from the gallery volume into the cylinder until the inlet valve closes again, which is the case when the cylinder pressure is higher than the gallery pressure. With the upward motion, the diesel is compressed until the outlet (high pressure) valve, HV in Figure 1, into the rail opens and diesel flows into the rail.
The radial piston pump is driven by the combustion engine such that its shaft rotates with the angular velocity of the crank shaft. During one revolution of the shaft, the cylinders are moving times up and down due to the eccentricities of the shaft. Moreover, the cylinders are mounted with a relative angle to each other, see Figure 1, and the motion of the cylinders is sinusoidal. Thus, the volume of the i-th cylinder reads as

The areas of the spring loaded inlet valves depend on the difference in pressure . If the pressure difference is lower than , then the valve is closed, i.e. . For pressures higher than , the valve is completely opened, i.e. , with the maximum area of the suction valve. For pressures between these two levels, the area is assumed to increase linearly with the pressure drop. This results in the mathematical model of the form
(21)
Graph
The mass flow through the inlet valve is then given by
2.5. Rail
The rail is used as storage for pressurized diesel. It is connected to the radial piston pump, which supplies the mass flow , and the injectors, which inject the mass flow into the combustion chambers of the engine. The diesel pressure in the (constant) rail volume is formulated as
(25)
Graph
with the bulk modulus and the density of diesel in the rail according to Section 2.1. The overall injector leakage mass flow is modelled in the form of a laminar flow into the tank (pressure ), i.e.

Graph
with the leakage coefficient .
As already mentioned at the beginning of this section, the injection process is rather complex and therefore an accurate description of the injector mass flows , , with the number of injectors (equal to the number of cylinders of the combustion engine), is beyond the scope of this paper. A simplified description is meaningful, since the exact time evolution of the injector mass flow is irrelevant for the design of a control strategy for the rail pressure. Instead, a model is proposed, which covers the following essential characteristics:
The periodic injection of diesel yields fluctuations in the rail pressure with the frequency . These variations in the rail pressure should be included approximately in the mathematical model.

Of course, the average mass flow of the injectors of one injection cycle must be accurately described by the model.
Based on these considerations, a sawtooth characteristic of the form
2.6. Simulation results
In this section, simulation results are shown to analyse the behaviour of the modelled system, and the stationary mass flow is compared with measurements to validate the model.
Figure 8 depicts simulation results of the cylinder pressures and the gallery pressure , as well as the mass flows and for a constant FMU position 0.85, a crank revolution speed and a constant rail pressure Taking a closer look at cylinder 1 first, the pressure decreases during the downward stroke of the piston until the cylinder pressure is lower than the gallery pressure and the inlet valve opens. Since the FMU is rather widely opened, the increasing cylinder volume can be completely filled by the diesel flowing through the inlet valve, i.e. . After some time, however, the cylinder volume increases faster than it can be filled with diesel such that the diesel in the cylinder starts to cavitate. Then, the cylinder pressure is almost constant and thus also the mass flow into the cylinder remains almost constant. The cylinder pressure begins to rise again when the cylinder is completely filled with fluid. If this happens before the bottom dead centre (BDC) (as it is the case in Figure 8), the cylinder is completely filled at the BDC and the mass flow of the radial piston pump is solely determined by the geometrical displacement and the angular velocity of the pump. Moreover, in this case, the two cylinders do not influence each other since the inlet valve of cylinder 1 closes before the inlet valve of cylinder 2 opens.
In contrast to this, the FMU opening is smaller () in the simulation scenario depicted in Figure 9. This brings along that the cavitation in the cylinder immediately starts after the inlet valve opens and the cylinder is not completely filled when passing the BDC. Thus, in this case, the mass flow of the radial piston pump is also influenced by the opening of the FMU. Time intervals do occur where the inlet valves of both cylinders are opened and thus both cylinders draw diesel from the gallery.
Measurements of the cylinder pressures and mass flows are not available for a validation of the model. Thus, the average mass flow of the radial piston pump for various FMU positions and crank shaft revolution speeds are used to validate the stationary accuracy of the model. The results in Figure 10 show a comparison of the measurement data (cross symbols) with simulation results (solid lines). It can be seen that for small openings of the FMU, the mass flow is basically determined by the FMU opening and is almost independent of the angular velocity of the crank shaft. For higher openings, the mass flow is, however, determined by the geometrical displacement of the pump. A comparison of the measurement data with simulation results of the model shows that the maximum errors are well below 10%, which is a very good result since the model has been parameterized by the nominal geometrical parameters of the system only.
inally, in Figure 11, the dynamics of the modelled system is discussed. Here, the current is switched from 0 to 1 at and back to at . Due to the preload of the spring, this implies that the FMU is entirely opened for at the beginning and the end of the simulation and closed in between. The average injected diesel mass flow is set to . Since the injected mass flow is lower than the mass flow delivered by the radial piston pump from the beginning until and after , the rail pressure is increasing. During , the FMU is closed and no diesel is delivered to the rail. Thus, the rail pressure decreases in this time interval. When the current in the solenoid is switched at , the magnetic force leads the valve spool to move and close the FMU, see the time evolution of . Note that the rail pressure is still increasing a short time after the FMU is closed. This is due to the fact that one cylinder is still filled with diesel which is delivered into the rail. The same effect occurs when the FMU is opening. The cylinders have to be filled and the diesel compressed, before diesel is delivered to the rail. This results in some kind of dead time in the system, which is a function of the angular velocity of the crank shaft, see also [[ 8]].
3. Average model
As the ripples in the rail pressure due to the piston strokes of the pump and the injection process cannot be affected by the FMU, only the average value of the rail pressure during one stroke is relevant for the control strategy.[ 2] Typically, control strategies for the rail pressure are based on a stationary (measured) characteristic map of the mass flow of the pump as a function of the FMU position and the rotational speed of the pump . This approach, however, has two basic drawbacks:

In the controller design, handling of characteristic maps might be difficult, since higher derivatives of these maps are frequently required, e.g. in a flatness-based controller. The numerical calculation of these derivatives might become cumbersome.

It is difficult to analyse the influence of parameter variations or different installation sizes by means of maps obtained from measurements.
Thus, an average model based on the detailed model of the previous section is strived for. In order to derive an average model, only a single cylinder of the pump is considered in the first step. The influence of the second piston is taken into account in a second step.
3.1. Single cylinder
Figures 12 and 13 show the pressure and the mass flows and of one cylinder for one piston stroke, a constant FMU position (approximately 50% opening in Figure 12 and approximately 30% in Figure 13), and a constant rail pressure. The piston stroke can be divided into the subsequent phases:
The high-pressure valve is closed at the TDC and the pressure in the cylinder is equal to the rail pressure at . During phase I, both valves are closed such that the diesel mass in the cylinder is constant and the pressure decreases as the volume increases.

The inlet valve is opened at when the cylinder pressure is equal to the gallery pressure . In this phase, the mass flow through the inlet valve is high enough to completely fill the increasing volume of the cylinder.

If the pressure in the cylinder further drops beyond the vapour pressure , the diesel starts to vaporize. However, below the lower vapour pressure , all diesel is vaporized and the cylinder pressure is basically constant. In order to simplify the treatment of cavitation, is set in the average model. This is reasonable, since is small and thus errors connected to this simplification are negligible.

In this phase, the volume of the cylinder can again be filled completely before the piston reaches its BDC. Note that this phase is not present in Figure 13, where the FMU is opened only approximately 30% of its maximum value. Figure 12 showing the results for a wider opened FMU of 50% of its maximum value contains such a phase.

When the pressure rises above at , the inlet valve is closed and the diesel is compressed until the pressure reaches at .

In this phase, the outlet valve is open and diesel is delivered into the rail.
It can be seen that the mass of diesel delivered into the rail during one cycle of the piston stroke is given by the difference of the maximum diesel mass in the cylinder before the inlet valve closes and the mass at , i.e. the time when the inlet valve opens, . This directly gives the average mass flow in the form
4. Conclusions
In this paper, a detailed mathematical model of a common-rail diesel system was derived. A special focus was laid on the accurate modelling of the radial piston pump in combination with the FMU, where it was shown that cavitation occurs in the cylinders of the pump. This effect is typically not taken into account analytically in mathematical models of the system but has a significant influence on the system's behaviour. Based on this detailed model, an average model of considerably reduced complexity was derived. The stationary accuracy of both models was proven by means of measurement results of a real common-rail system.
One major advantage of the proposed model is that it can be easily parameterized by means of the geometric parameters of the system, not requiring extensive measurements. Thus, it is also possible to simulate different designs of the system (e.g. different size and number of pistons) and to estimate their performance without relying on extensive measurements. The average model also features these benefits and is, due to the reduced complexity, very well suited for a (non-linear) controller design.
Current research is dealing with new model-based control strategies based on the average model, where already first promising results have been obtained. These control strategies are currently further investigated by our project partner Robert Bosch GmbH.

Since the average and the peak pressure are directly coupled, controlling the peak pressure is equivalent to controlling the average pressure. Thus, subsequently only this case is considered.

ABSTRACT The selection and tuning of the Fuel Injection System (FIS) are among the most critical tasks for the automotive diesel engine design engineers. In fact, the injection strongly affects the combustion phenomena through which controlling a wide range of related issues such as pollutant emissions, combustion noise and fuel efficiency becomes feasible. In the scope of the engine design optimization, the simulation is an efficient tool in order to both predict the key performance parameters of the FIS, and to reduce the amount of experiments needed to reach the final product configuration.
In this work a complete characterization of a solenoid ballistic injector for a Light-Duty Common Rail system was therefore implemented in a commercially available one-dimensional computational software called GT-SUITE. The main phenomena governing the injector operation were simulated by means of three sub-models (electro-magnetic, hydraulic and mechanical).
The model was validated using experimental data obtained by a Zeuch’s method injection analyzer. To this end, the experimental injection rate profiles and injected volumes along with rail pressure profiles were acquired in several multi-event injector operation strategies pertaining to different engine operating conditions, typical of the NEDC operation. The use of different Energizing Time (ET) and Dwell Time (DT) values allowed the evaluation of the injector potential in applying advanced actuation strategies and the assessment of the model capability to simulate the injection system operation in challenging operating conditions such as close injection events.
INTRODUCTION The fuel injection apparatus is a key sub-system for direct-injected internal combustion engines as its operation controls to a large extent both the mixture formation and the combustion processes. In particular, in compression ignition engines the fuel metering accuracy, the required injection rate time-profile and the uniform fuel spray spreading in the combustion chamber are strictly governed by the injection system behavior. The achievement of these complex tasks is mandatory in order to fulfill the current automotive market design targets in terms of fuel conversion efficiency, combustion noise control and pollutant emissions level. [1], [2], [3], [4].
In the last years the injection systems design has been continuously developed in order to allow the application of complex, multi-event injection strategies so as to gain a better control of the fuel injection rate time-profile, which is the most effective approach to control the 
combustion process development in Diesel engines. The application of injection strategies based on reduced dwell-time, multi events and/ or on the modulation of the fuel discharge rate in the single event enabled significant improvements in the combustion control capabilities with respect to first-generation, common rail injection systems. The injection system ability to actuate complex strategies is largely based on an improved injector dynamic response, which in turn allows lower dwell-times; obviously, the injector dynamic characteristics are realistically exploitable only if the system shot-to-shot repeatability in terms of fuel metering and injection rate is preserved, along with the prescribed jet-tojet evolution uniformity. [5].
In this scenario, the introduction of ballistic common-rail injectors, in which the needle lift is not limited by a mechanical stop but it is determined by the system hydraulics and the needle inertia, is a significant step in the development of fast-response systems. Given the improved capabilities of this last generation common-rail systems, the need of both experimental and numerical tools assisting the injection system tuning process is even higher than in the recent past. [6]. The huge amount of potentially interesting injection and combustion strategies requires validated and robust numerical tools simulating both the injection and combustion systems operation, possibly in a coupled numerical environment, in order to reduce the number of experimental tests at the hydraulic and engine test benches.
In the frame of a medium term research program aiming at the development of a comprehensive numerical tool to simulate both the injection system and the engine operation, a numerical 1-D model of a solenoid, ballistic injector was built and validated in the GT-SUITE environment. The injector model was validated by means of experimental data acquired by a Zeuch’s Method-based Injection Analyzer. [7], [8], [9].
As the present research final goal is developing a design tool for the Fuel Injection System (FIS) operating in part load conditions typical of the NEDC cycle, the injection system 1-D model was developed and tuned focusing on complex injection strategies. As a matter of fact, although several papers are present in literature concerning the development of 1-D models for Diesel injectors, unfortunately only partial validations of such models are generally presented: the reported validations are often carried out for relatively long injection events, which are only moderately interesting for the implementation of advanced, multi-event injection strategies currently used for automotive applications.
The injection system was operated in several multi-injection strategies, at different rail pressure values The results obtained at the hydraulic bench (injection rate profiles and rail pressure profiles) were used to tune the 1-D injector model, obtaining a satisfactory accuracy of the predicted injection rate profiles also with complex, reduced dwell-time actuation strategies.
EXPERIMENTAL FACILITIES As it is described in the introduction section, the goal of this work is the model building and calibration of a commercial second generation solenoid common-rail injector and, then, the validation against the experimentally measured mass flow rate and total quantity injected data.
Since in order to validate the 1-D injector model, in addition to all the main geometric characteristics of the injector, experimental hydraulic data are required mainly in terms of rail pressure time history and solenoid current profile (inputs to the model) and injection rate curve (to be compared with the model main output). The experimental facilities which were exploited to this end will be described in detail in next paragraphs.
Internal Geometry The detection of the internal geometry of the injector is needed to obtain a good geometric characterization. Nozzle, Z-hole and A-hole are the critical parts of the injector where cavitation can appear and, consequently, a precise detection has to be done. In literature, the most most used technique for the evaluation of geometric parameters, consists of the use of special silicone to obtain a mold of the physical part. Then, using a Scanning Electron Microscope, pictures are obtained and processed by means of CAD software. [10], [11], [12].
In this work a different methodology was adopted: more specifically, a 3D Computed Tomography (CT) of the injector was carried out. This technique is nowadays among the most advanced available in the industry; CT is a completely nondestructive and noncontact method for obtaining three-dimensional representation of the scanned object both externally and internally. A CT scanner consists of an x-ray emitting source, a positioning system, a detector and electronic and computational devices for data acquisition and elaboration. The principles are described below: radiographic images of the part are acquired from different angles; then, combining together all the acquired images, a virtual slice through the part is reconstructed. When different consecutive slices are computed, a 3D visualization is obtained. The reason why it was decided to use this technique is that it has many advantages with respect to traditional dimensional measuring systems, especially in terms of reduced measuring time, including scanning, reconstruction and analysis time. [13], [14]. An example of the images of the injector obtained through CT is reported in Figure 1.
Injection Analyzer The experimental hydraulic data used to tune and validate the GT-SUITE 1-D model of the solenoid injector were obtained at Perugia University SprayLab by a proprietary STS Injection Analyzer. This instrument is designed to simultaneously measure 
Piano et al / SAE Int. J. Engines / Volume 9, Issue 1 (April 2016)566
both the global injected volume and the injection rate time history (along with other dynamic signals such as rail pressure, injector current, needle lift) in a given operating condition. The operating condition is defined by the rail pressure level and by the injector actuation strategy, based on 2n-1 parameters (with n ET values and n-1 DT values); the instrument can vary any of the 2n-1 parameters to analyze the system behavior. The mean injected volume and the dynamic signals are acquired in the same batch of consecutive injection events, allowing both the mean behavior and the shot-toshot dispersion evaluation. In case of multi-injections strategy, the injected volume from the single injection events can also be derived.
The injection rate measurement by the STS Injection Analyzer is based on the Zeuch’s Method, i.e. the injection in a closed, fixedvolume chamber filled with the same injected fluid. At the injection occurrence, the injected volume ΔV is forced to enter the measuring chamber, in which before the injection event the Pbase level (50 bar in this campaign) is maintained, causing its pressure to rise according to Equation 1:
(1)
where k is the fluid Bulk Modulus and V is the measuring chamber volume. Differentiating Equation 1 allows the injection rate evaluation:
(2)
The pressure history in the measuring chamber, along with the fluid temperature, is detected by a piezo-resistive sensor (Kistler 4075 A100). At the end of each injector actuation cycle, the globally injected volume is evacuated from the measurement chamber by a fast acting solenoid valve in order to re-set the Pbase pressure level for the next injection cycle. The fluid escaping the Injection Analyzer flows through a Coriolis mass flow meter (Siemens Sitrans CF 2100, accuracy ± 0.5% of the actual reading in the range 0.1-4 kg/h) to measure the mean injected mass and the fuel density over an assigned set of injector actuation cycles. Further, the mass flow meter allows a continuous instrument calibration overcoming the difficulties in determining the fluid bulk modulus in the actual operating conditions. More details about the STS Injection Analyzer are reported in [15], [16], [17].
The rail supply was provided by a CP1H Bosch pump driven by an electric motor, with a transmission ratio set to simulate a 2100 engine rpm operation. A pickup on the pump shaft triggered the pulse train generation for the injection system, with an injection phasing to the pump TDC analogous to the engine operation. The rail pressure is set by a two-way, PWM-modulated inlet metering valve controlled by a self-developed PID strategy. In stand-by (noinjection) conditions, a rail pressure ripple within the minimum between 2% of the set point and 10 bar was obtained. The rail was submerged in an oil-heated vessel so as to regulate the fuel temperature in the rail-injector pipe @40±1 °C with all the injection pressure levels and injection strategies. The used fluid for the experimental test is a commercial, ISO4113 compliant Diesel pump test fluid [18]. The same standard test fluid has been selected from the GT-Suite database for the numerical simulations.
COMPUTATIONAL INJECTOR MODEL DESCRIPTION GT-SUITE is a simulation tool for design and analysis of engine and vehicle system and components [19]. It is capable of modeling the coupled behavior of hydraulic and mechanical components, and it is also able to study steady-state and transient response. GT-SUITE is based on one-dimensional, compressible, unsteady fluid dynamics and multi-body dynamics. Moreover, flow and heat transfer in the piping and volumes can be modeled, as well as mass dynamics. As it can be seen in the next sections, the flow solver includes models for cavitation, frequency dependent friction, species transport and non-equilibrium aeration everywhere in the system. [20].
Electromagnetic Valve The solenoid model is built from electric and magnetic primitives representing the electromagnetic system: a current source, a coil, radial and axial magnetic components, and the air gap between the solenoid and armature. The main geometrical characteristics of the solenoid valve components are reported in Table 1.
The model solves for the magnetic flux induced by current in the coil. This flux passes through the magnetic circuit, generating a force on the armature according to the flux and air gap, as shown in Figure 2, where the flux is represented by a dashed red line.
Control Valve The performance of a servo driven injector is mainly ruled by the control valve, typically a solenoid actuated valve. The fluid-structure interaction of the valve is modeled using the 1D mechanic library and some fluid-mechanical sub-models or templates (FMT). Starting from the Bosch CRI 2.5 model on, a new generation of valve called ‘pressure-balanced’ has been introduced. With the ‘pressure-balanced’ valve it is possible to increase rail pressure without increasing at the same time the spring’s preload, the magnetic force and the static leakage [21]. Because of its layout, the pressure-balanced valves have a sealing seat-diameter three times higher than the standard ones. To get the same flow area of the standard valve these valves have a reduced stroke-end thereby improving the injection performances. The valve-seat region was modeled by two fluid mechanical templates with opposed pressure forces. Two different templates were used to model correctly the valve-seat region of the valve. More specifically, a “FluidPiston” template was used to model the interaction between flow and mechanical system, while a “FlapperValve” template was used to calculate the change in flow area as a function of the lift of the poppet, the pressure force on the poppet and the redistribution of the attached volumes. For the latter, a linear variation of the pressure acting in the flapper seat area was assumed. The net hydraulic force acting on the armature results from the difference between the flapper valve’s diameter and the fluid piston’s diameter. This difference of diameters generates a total force which is consistent with the values found in literature [21]. The flapper valve template also defines the flow area as a function of the armature’s lift.
In order to model the armature’s movement accurately it has been necessary to simulate both all the pressure surfaces of the armature and the fuel path across the pilot valve.
Control Chamber As known, the needle motion results from an imbalance of the pressure forces acting on the needle. This imbalance results from a reduction of the pressure in the control chamber which is initiated by opening the control valve. When the control valve is opened, fuel drains from the high pressure at the inlet of the injector, through the inlet orifice into the control chamber, and through the outlet orifice to the low pressure downstream of the control valve. Once the control valve is fully open, the design of these orifices has a significant impact on the pressure in the control chamber and therefore the imbalance of forces on the needle. The large pressure drop across these orifices can cause cavitation so care is required to investigate the flow through them.
The geometry of the inlet and outlet holes strongly affects the dynamic behavior of the needle. As a result, the control volume orifice of the injector need to be hydraulically characterized. An example of a possible experimental setup for the characterization of the flow through these controlling orifices was proposed by Salvador et al. [9].
Figure 4. Control chamber model - Inlet and outlet holes
Z-Hole The Computed Tomography of the injector shows a conical section of the orifice. In this case, the sub-model adopted to evaluate the discharge coefficient of the inlet orifice, does not consider the cavitation phenomenon. This hypothesis is consistent with hydraulic characterization made by Salvador et al., where the mass flow rate has a linear behavior with the square root of the pressure [10].
The value of the maximum discharge coefficient is related to the orifice geometry and it can be defined by the mass conservation equation:
(3)
Where ṁf is the fuel mass flow rate, A0 is the geometric area of the orifice, ρf is the fuel density and Δp is the difference between upstream and downstream pressure.
A-hole As opposed to the Z-hole, the A-hole has not a conical section but a cylindrical one. Moreover, from the hydraulic characterization a different behavior can be seen [10]: there is a value of pressure drop above which the mass flow rate is constant and the orifice cavitates. The discharge coefficient was therefore estimated by means of the GT-SUITE sub-model for liquid flow through an orifice, including cavitation effects, based on Sarre et al. work [22]. The transition into cavitation is defined by a critical cavitation number and the discharge coefficient will be a constant value for no cavitation and calculated based on the cavitation number in cavitating regime. The cavitation number K is defined as [20], [22]:
(4)
where p1 is the pressure upstream of the orifice, p2 is the pressure downstream of the orifice, and pv is the vapour pressure of the fluid.
The onset of cavitation is specified by the critical cavitation number. If the cavitation number is lower than the critical cavitation number, the orifice is cavitating and the discharge coefficient will be calculated as [20], [22]:
(5)
where Cc is the contraction coefficient, defined as [20], [22]:
(6)
in which  is the ratio of the inlet radius to the orifice diameter. The contraction coefficient is limited to be ≤ 1. If > Kcrit , there is no cavitation and the discharge coefficient is calculated as [20], [22]:
(7)
The geometrical and hydraulic parameters are shown in Table 3. Given the impossibility to measure R (inlet radius of the orifice) with the 3D CT resolution, the Contraction Coefficient was considered similar to the value found in literature. [10].

Figure 5. Sketch of the control piston model
Control Piston and Needle Mechanics The pressure force acting on the control piston is calculated with a dedicated sub-model that determines the pressure force using the upstream and downstream pressures. The pressure acting on the needle varies due to the design of the nozzle and the tight fit of the needle in the nozzle. In order to accurately model the pressure force on the needle, the flow path through the nozzle is modelled using fluid volumes and pipes. In particular the needle poppet valve is modelled by calculating the flow area through the valve based on the position of the mass attached to it. The valve's discharge coefficient is determined based on the Reynolds number of the flow through the valve. The volume changes due to the poppet motion are also taken into account.
Figure 6. Sketch of the needle model
The high-pressure fuel acting on the control piston and needle leads to significant axial deformation of their bodies given the small needle lifts in injectors. This is taken into account by separating each body into two masses connected by a spring and a damper. The spring represents the axial stiffness of the body and the damper accounts for material damping.
Hydraulic Network Explicit solver is used for time integration of the fluid dynamics, adopting short time steps in order to capture high frequency events, since the wave dynamics can significantly affect the hydraulic behavior of the injector and because a short time scale is desired in terms of injection rate profile respect to crank angle.
As far as the friction and the heat transfer settings for the flow circuit are concerned, it is worth to mention that, while typical friction models are based on Moody chart fits, in an unsteady flow, as in this case, a model that adapts to the amplitude and frequency of the flow pulsations is needed. Usually this model is called frequencydependent and considers that the friction and heat transfer are enhanced due to boundary layer regrowth [20].
Nozzle The nozzle orifices or holes are modelled in a detailed way, where the injector internal flow volumes, mechanics and hydro-mechanical interactions are considered. As it has been done for the Z-hole, the conical section of the nozzle holes allows neglecting the cavitation phenomenon. One of the most critical aspects for modelling the nozzle is the characterization of the orifices, dimensionally as well as hydraulically. In order to obtain a proper calibration of the nozzle orifices parameters, a stationary flushing of the nozzle, corresponding to the test for the determination of the nozzle flow number, was simulated. The so called nozzle flow number is the total volumetric amount of fuel that passes through the nozzle holes in 30 seconds considering a pressure drop equal to 100 bar between the boundaries.
VALIDATION The model was validated using experimental data obtained by a Zeuch’s method injection analyzer. To this end, the experimental injection rate profiles and injected volumes along with rail pressure profiles were acquired in several single and multi-event injector operation strategies.
Test Matrix The experimental measurements relative to the nozzle #1 correspond to rail pressures and energizing time highlighted in Table 5. The test matrix selection was based on the evaluation of the injection system operating conditions typical of the NEDC cycle.
Table 5. Test matrix for nozzle #1
Results of the Injector Model Nozzle #1 The predictive capability of the hydraulic model was firstly assessed by comparing numerical results with actual injected volume quantities and flow rates for different rail pressures and energizing times in case of a single injection events for nozzle #1, as reported in Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12. The comparison of the experimental total injected volume with the simulation results over a wide range ET values is shown in Figure 9: as one can see, the model predictive capability can be considered as more than satisfactory for all the analyzed injector command profiles, with errors which are, on average, lower than 10%. The blue dots in Figure 9 indicate the injections events that will be further analyzed in Figures 10, 11 and 12. As far as the instantaneous volume flow rates are concerned, the experimental and simulated values are compared in Figures 10, 11 and 12 for 3 different Energizing Time values for each of the 3 rail pressure investigated. As the figures show, a high level of accuracy was achieved in replicating the behavior of the injector with single-event injection strategies. More in details, it can be observed that both the injection start and end timings are accurately predicted, along with the injection rate level rising and lowering trends during the transient phases of the process. Some moderate inaccuracy can be observed for the high flow rate phase at high rail pressure levels (see Figures 11 and 12, bottom graphs), where the predicted maximum flow rate is about 5% lower than the experimental value
Finally, the model predictive capability was also assessed for multiple injection events, and, as an example, the results obtained for a Pilot+Pilot+Main event for a rail pressure equal to 1000 bar, compared with the simulation result are shown in Figure 13. The high accuracy of the model in predicting the experimental injection rate also with multiple injections is confirmed, even for relatively complex injector command strategies, characterized by reduced DT values between consecutive injection events.
Nozzle #2 In order to further assess the predictive capabilities of the injector model, a different nozzle (identified as Nozzle #2 in Table 4) was tested and simulated. To this end, the experimental injection rate profiles and injected volumes along with rail pressure profiles were again acquired in several multi-event injector operation strategies pertaining to different engine operating conditions, typical of the NEDC operation. As an example, the comparison of the experimental volume flow rate with the simulated one is shown in Figure 14, for 3 different injection patterns which could be adopted for a 2000 rpm, 8 bar bmep engine point (the main parameters of these injection patterns are reported in Table 6). The more than satisfactory accuracy of the model in predicting the actual behavior of the injector even for multiple injection events can therefore be confirmed
CONCLUSIONS A methodology for obtaining a complete characterization of a solenoid ballistic injector for a Light-Duty Common Rail injection system and building a simulation model including three main 
sub-models (electro-magnetic, hydraulic and mechanical) in a commercially available one-dimensional computational software called GT-SUITE was presented in this work.
In order to obtain a good accuracy of the model, different crucial issues need to be addressed: 
1. an accurate detection of the internal geometry of the injector is needed to obtain a proper geometric characterization. In this work a 3D Computed Tomography (CT) of the injector was adopted. 2. An extensive dataset of experimental measurements is needed for model validation. In this work instantaneous injection flow rates measured by means of an STS Injection Analyzer, that is based on the Zeuch’s Method, were used.
The comparison between the experimental and simulated volumetric injection rates showed a more than satisfactory accuracy of the model in predicting the actual behavior of the ballistic injector both for single and multiple injection event patterns, even for relatively complex injector command strategies, characterized by reduced DT values between consecutive injection events.
The satisfactory assessment of the predictive capability of the injector model can therefore pave the way for the coupling with predictive engine combustion models, in order to obtain an integrated numerical model which could then be used as a “virtual test rig”, for evaluating the effects of different engine calibrations in terms of combustion development and emissions production.

ABSTRACT−Since the needle displacement exerts a fundamental influence on the operation of Common Rail injection
systems, accurate measurements of the control piston position can be crucial for a more thorough analysis of the behaviour
of injectors, in particular when multiple injections are employed. Eddy current sensors have traditionally been used in lab
activities to measure the control piston position inside injectors; apart from the high cost, the scientific literature clearly shows
their inadequacy, which is mainly due to the presence of electromagnetic disturbance: the current pulse, which controls the
opening of the injector, generates electromagnetic fields which strongly affect the acquisition of data. Many attempts have
recently been made either to solve the interference occurring during such measurements or to propose alternative displacement
transducers whose operation is not influenced by electromagnetic interference. In this paper, a new device for measuring the
injector opening is proposed: it is an optical transducer characterized both by simple and very cheap construction and by a
reliable physical principle for measuring the control piston lift. The reliability of the proposed sensor is assessed by a thorough
experimental campaign and by comparing the experimental results with the numerical predictions achieved by a Common Rail
injector model. Since the assembly of the optical sensor does not affect the injector operation, it can efficiently be used both
for experimental tests and for on-board diagnosis and monitoring of the injector operation.

1. INTRODUCTION
The advent of the electronic Diesel engine control plays an important role in the development of diesel engines, in
terms of performance improvement and optimization of consumptions. As is well known, the Common Rail (CR)
MultiJet system has replaced the previous UniJet system, allowing Diesel engines to satisfy all the environmental
targets (euro 3 and euro 4 standards) concerning the reduction in exhaust emissions and combustion noise
(Tanaka et al., 2002; Celikten, 2003; Vanegas and Peters, 2009). However, in order to satisfy the stricter limits
imposed by new European emission standards (Euro 5 and, after 2014, Euro 6), reliable predictions of the engine
behaviour, including all the parameters affecting it, are required. Current research studies have been focused on the
injection process. The effects of different parameters upon the quantity of fuel injected by a common rail injector was
thoroughly analyzed by Bai et al. (2016).
An effective one-dimensional spray model was developed by Xu et al. (2016), in order to understand the effect of gas
flow on the penetration of diesel sprays. The impact of different injection types and after-treatment systems on
particulate emissions of light-duty vehicles was deeply investigated by Oh and Cha (2015). Nanoparticles and
other harmful exhaust emissions in accordance with injection strategies and air-fuel ratio changes for small
diesel engines were analyzed by Eom et al. (2017). All the abovementioned papers along with other relevant
research papers (e.g., the studies developed by Lim and Lee (2016) and Wang et al. (2015)) have provided
advancements in modelling, predicting and understanding some important aspects regarding the injection process.
In this scenario, this paper is focused on a very important aspect of the injection process, which is the measurement
of the needle lift inside an injector. Infact, since the displacement of the needle exerts a strong influence on the
injection performance, accurate measurements of the needle position can be instrumental in achieving a more
thorough analysis of the behaviour of injectors. Precise knowledge of the needle lift during injections
can also help researchers better investigate misfire in Diesel engines (which is due, as is well known, to injection
problems) in order to improve current methods for detecting the phenomenon (Chang et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2011; Liu et
al., 2013; Fan et al., 2014).
Significant improvements must still be done as far as the measurement of the needle lift is concerned, in spite of the
several advancements achieved in measuring systems for internal combustion engines, such as highly-effective
measurement techniques for the characterization of particle emissions (see, e.g., the studies developed by Amirante et

al. (2015a), Myung et al. (2014) and Choi et al. (2014)) or
novel solutions for the in-cylinder pressure measurement
(see, e.g., the cost-effective solution proposed by Amirante
et al. (2015b), and novel NOx prediction methods based on
the in-cylinder pressure measurement developed by Chung
et al. (2016).
To the authors’ knowledge, all the commercially available
displacement transducers cannot be used in serial application
for on-board measurements of the needle lift because of the
complexity of their assembly which in turn affects the
normal operation of injection systems. In laboratory
applications, eddy current sensors have traditionally been
used to measure the displacement of the control piston,
which is equal to that of the needle because they are always
in contact inside the injector; however, in spite of their
widespread use, the scientific literature clearly shows their
inadequacy for such applications, because of the presence
of electromagnetic disturbances (generated by current
pulses controlling the opening and closing phases of
injectors) which strongly affect signal acquisition. As far as
this issue is concerned, very complex and expensive
solutions have been proposed to date in an attempt to avoid
the electromagnetic interference that usually occurs during
measurements (Sienkiewicz and Shukla, 1997; Prelle et al.,
2006; Virdee, 2004). Among these solutions, the possibility
of mounting the eddy current sensor directly in the nozzle
to obtain a much higher signal quality could be very
promising; however, apart from its high cost, the extension
of this technique to on-board measurements seems
unfeasible because of its complexity.
In contrast, this paper proposes the design of a new and
cheap sensor for reliable measurements of the control
piston lift, namely an optical transducer that guarantees
lower manufacturing costs and times in comparison with
all the solutions proposed recently. The choice of using an
optical measurement system is justified by its capability of
ensuring high standards of signal cleanliness even during
measurements affected by high interference.
Apart from its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, the
optical sensor has the potential to outperform the previous
solutions because its implementation in a commercial
injector does not affect the injector operation; therefore, for
the first time, the proposed sensor can efficiently be used
also for on-board diagnosis and monitoring of the injection
process.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Operating Principles and Assembly of the Optical
Sensor
Figure 1 shows two cross sectional views of a typical CR
injector. The position of the needle (1) and the control
piston (2), which are kept in contact by the nozzle spring
(3) and an intermediate element (4), is determined by both
the fuel pressure in the delivery chamber (5) and the fuel
pressure in the control chamber (6). When the solenoid (7)

is energized, the check ball (8) lifts from its seat and the
fuel pressure in the control chamber drops because the fuel
is discharged through hole A (9). The pressure in the
control chamber cannot rise quickly because of hole Z (10),
therefore the higher pressure acting on the needle forces the
needle to lift from its seat, thus commencing the injection.
The measurement of the needle displacement is not a
trivial task because the needle is placed in the engine head,
which operates at very high temperatures. Another issue is
the mechanical resistance of the needle, which is surrounded
by fuel at high pressure and an eventual drilling operation
aimed at placing a sensor on the needle could affect its
mechanical resistance.
To overcome these issues, technical solutions provided
to date are based on the use of displacement transducers
positioned in the injector body in order to measure the
position of the control piston, rather than the needle position.
Specifically, eddy current sensors are traditionally used to
accomplish this task. However, the development of this
solution needs to face up several technical difficulties,
which are still unresolved. First of all, the installation of an
eddy current sensor requires material removal from the control piston by means of machining operations in order
to realize the conical surface on which its components are
usually placed (see Figure 2). Despite removing material
from the control piston is less critical than removing the
same amount of material from the needle, such a conical
part can introduce a point of mechanical weakness even in
the control piston and alter its total deformation when
subjected to the compression forces.
This technique is very expensive and its application is
only used in laboratory tests. Moreover, measurements
provided by an eddy current sensor are disturbed by the
electromagnetic interference generated by the current that
circulates in the solenoid of the injector, resulting in
degradation and partial loss of data that make the signal
less accurate.
To overcome the interferences and high costs arising
from the employment of eddy current sensors, the device
presented here is an optical sensor. It is mainly composed
of a cheap light emitting diode and a compatible photo
receiver, which are positioned opposite each other. As
shown in Figure 3, the two photo elements are placed
outside the injector body and in correspondence of the
control piston.
A beam of infrared light (λ ≈ 900 nm) is generated by the
photo diode and then reaches the photo receiver by virtue
of both the two holes (d = 4 mm) machined in the injector
body and the hole (d = 1.5 mm) machined in the control
piston.
The hole in the control piston, because of its great
hardness, was achieved by means of a drilling operation
with cemented carbide (Widia) tools.
The motion of the control piston during the injector
opening and closing causes the variation in the overlap
between the holes of the injector body, which are motionless,
and the hole of the control piston, which can move
perpendicularly to the light beam (see Figure 4). As a
result, the receiver is reached by a light beam whose
intensity is proportional to the area of the intersection
between the fixed circles and the moving one, and such
intensity variations are indicative of the displacement of
the control piston.
Figure 5 shows the geometrical characteristics of the
emitter and the receiver used in this work. Both the emitter
and the receiver require a power supply of 5 V. The emitter
consists of a photodiode, made of gallium arsenide which
works in the infrared, emitting a light beam whose
wavelength is around 900 nm. In the circuit emitter, a
limiting resistor of the value of 40 ohms ± 5 % is placed in
series with the photodiode in order to limit the current
flowing through it, since the maximum allowable value is
100 mA (with +5 V supply voltage). The receiver is a NPN
silicon Photodarlington and is loaded with a resistance of
100 Ω placed between the emitter and the ground potential.
During a light pulse, the receiver is turned on and provides
an output voltage signal indicative of the piston
displacement. The time delay (rise and fall time) of the
receiver is 75 ns, which is much shorter than the duration
of the signal. Cheap receivers with higher dynamic
response are also available and could be employed to
further increase the system response.
As shown in Figure 6, two plates of polycarbonate
(capable of transmitting infrared light, stemming the
phenomena of the beam dispersion), whose pins are forced

into the aforementioned holes, were utilized to support the
diodes (Figure 6).
The dimensions of the plates did not constitute an issue
for the experimental test rig; therefore, for simplicity
reasons, large plates (compared to the dimensions of the
diodes) were used in the prototype to support the diodes.
However, it should be noted that the supports of the diodes
must be manufactured as small as possible in the case of
on-board measurements; considering that the diodes have
very short dimensions (see Figure 5), also their supports
can be designed very small. Even the layout of the supports
could be changed in order to better adapt the device to the
engine on which it is mounted.
Figure 7 reports the voltage-overlap relationship (blue
line), which was retrieved experimentally in a preliminary
test carried out to setup the device. The graph shows the
convenience of working in the middle part (approx. from
40 % to 70 %), in order to have both a linear trend (see
orange line) and the maximum voltage gradient (approx. 1
Volt) which increases the sensitivity of the sensor (the
voltage gradient could further be increased by acting on the
shape of the hole and employing an effective optimization
process based on genetic algorithms (Amirante et al., 2014;
Amirante and Tamburrano, 2014).
The proposed sensor does not affect the normal behaviour
of the injector on which it is mounted, because the emitter
and the receiver can be placed externally to the injector
body, and because the hole drilled in the control piston does
not alter its total deformation under compression. Figure 8
shows a drawing with dimensions of the control piston
used in the experimental campaign; in the case of the most
critical compression load of 2000 bar (the maximum
achievable injection pressure in typical CR systems)
applied both to the reference control piston (without the
hole) and to the same control piston with the hole, one can
easily verify that the percentage difference between their
deformations is less than 0.01 ‰ and hence absolutely
negligible. As a result, the drilled control piston does not
undergo any significant variations in its behaviour with
respect to the normal configuration (without the hole).
Similarly, the fatigue resistance is not significantly
changed. In fact, one can verify that, in the case of the most
critical fatigue loading cycle (alternate loads ranging from
the minimum pressure of 1 bar to the maximum achievable
pressure of 2000 bar), the coordinate given by the
intersection between the mean and the amplitude of the
stress cycling calculated in the critical section (in
correspondence of the hole) lies under the limit curve of the
Haigh diagram.
In conclusion, since the total deformation under
compression and the fatigue resistance of the control piston
are not changed significantly, the optical sensor can
successfully be used for on board application in addition to
typical lab tests.
2.2. Minor Modifications to the Injector Body
During the common operation of a CR injector, a little
amount of fuel, flowing through the internal channels of
the injector, goes back from the high pressure zone
surrounding the needle to the fuel tank (see Figure 9
leakage zone). Since the leakage reaches the optical device
Figure 7. Signal vs Overlap relationship.

piston.
Figure 9. Leakage flow through the internal channels of the
injector.
zone and the presence of fuel in the measuring chamber
can prevent the transit of the light signal, the injector
system needs a few modifications to isolate the volume
inside which the light passes, keeping the fuel away from
the measuring ambient.
In the prototype, this problem was easily solved by using
two elastomer rings, forced on the control piston and used
as mechanical seals, and by drilling two additional holes
above and below the measuring zone to allow drainage of
the oil, which was discharged from this zone to the fuel
tank by means of external tubes (see Figures 10 and 11). To
guarantee a greater tightness of the measuring ambient, the
zone comprised between the two elastomer rings was fed
with compressed air entering through another hole drilled
in the body of the injector (see Figure 11 n.1). In such a
way, the generated air cushion protected the measuring
zone from the reflux of the oil.
It is important to highlight that the pressure of the
supplied air can be kept slightly greater than 1 bar, and it
can be supplied by the turbocharger mounted in the vehicle
even without energy loss because there is no air consumption
in the measuring zone.
It should be noted that the absence of fuel in the
metering chamber does not increase friction between the
external surface of the control piston and the internal
surface of the injector body because, as shown in Figures 1,
9 and 11, these surfaces are not in contact in this zone and
here lubricating action is not required. In addition, all the
modifications shown in Figure 1 do not alter the regular
reflux of fuel towards the zones in which the surfaces are in
contact and require to be lubricated, so the overall
lubricating action is certainly not influenced.
2.3. Test Bench
The validity of the proposed solution was assessed by
several tests carried out on the Common Rail test bench of
the Polytechnic University of Bari.
The test bench, shown in Figure 12, is engine-free and is
composed of some commercial automotive components
Figure 10. Two gaskets placed above and below the hole of
the control piston (on the left); Holes drilled in the external
body for oil drainage (on the right).

zone: (1) Pipe delivering pressurized air; (2) Hole to

chamber for the optical measurement; (7) Holes to drain
fuel from the high pressure zones; (8) Injector body
(device patented in October 2012, with PCT extension
numbered PCT/IB2013/000815)
along with additional instrumentation which were properly
assembled in order to reproduce the main working
conditions of a typical Common Rail Injection system
(Catalano et al., 2002; Amirante et al., 2006; Carlucci et
al., 2008; Papagiannakis et al., 2007). Figure 12 also shows
a scheme of the test rig. There are two fuel circuits,
working at high (dark line) and low pressure (outlined
line), respectively. The mineral oil ISO 4113, which has the
same properties of Diesel fuel, was used during the
experimental tests. The high pressure pump (2) is equipped
with an electrical discharge valve (3) to regulate the rail
pressure. The fuel is injected into a cylindrical capacity,
charged with air at 20 bar, which replaces an engine
cylinder and also avoids cavitation inside the nozzle (6).
The injector is opened by a power supply equipment (12),
which provides the current to the coil. A low pressure
pump is installed inside the fuel tank (5) and supplies fuel
to the high pressure pump (2), driven by an electrical
engine. High pressure pipes connect the pump to the rail
(9) and the rail with the injector (14). A high frequency
transducer measures the pressure inside the nozzle (8). The
opening of the injector is driven by the current waveform,
which is constituted by a high current pulse (peak current)
to overcome the inertia of the injector, and a lower current
(hold current) to hold the injector opened.
Figure 13 shows the injector that was used to test the
optical sensor (identifiable by the code 0 445 110 183).
A piezo-resistive high pressure sensor was also adopted
to measure the time history of the injection pressure, which
represents a valid indication of the dynamic behaviour of
the injector. In fact, since the first experimental
investigations carried out by Fiat Research Centre and
successively by Bosch (Stumpp and Ricco, 1996),
measurements of the nozzle pressure have been used to
study the injector opening. The reliability of this approach
has been confirmed by other investigations that have
demonstrated the clear correlation among injector opening,
fuel spray across the nozzle and nozzle pressure
(Heimgärtner and Leipertz, 2000; Catania et al., 2008).
In the first experiences, the nozzle pressure was measured
indirectly by means of strain-gages fixed on the nozzle
(Stumpp and Ricco, 1996), while nowadays it is measured
directly by a pressure transducer placed on the nozzle
(Amirante et al., 2006).
The sensor employed in this work is the Kistler 4067
A2000 A2, with 2000 bar full scale and a precision of 0.5
% in the temperature range 20 ~ 200 °C. To allow the
placement of the pressure transducer, a hole of 1.5 mm was
drilled in the sprayer; the assembly is shown in Figure 14.
Such a modification does not affect the injector behaviour
as demonstrated in Amirante et al. (2006).
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Experimental Results
The experimental tests on the Common Rail bench were
performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed
sensor in measuring the control piston displacement during
UniJet and MultiJet injections. To that end, the parameters
of the injection process were properly set so as to
reproduce each possible scenario on the test bench. Figure
15 shows a first example reporting the time histories both
of the voltage signal from the optical sensor (red line) and
of the current supplied to the coil (blue line), both obtained
during a main injection. It is noteworthy that the trend of
the voltage signal traces the expected needle lift; in fact, the
voltage curve suddenly decreases when the peak of current
occurs (approx. at 3300 µs) and, as expected, the injector
starts opening (approx. at 3500 µs). Afterwards, as a
consequence of the increasing lift of the needle, the voltage
curve decreases until the maximum lift is reached (approx.
at 4800 µs) and the voltage assumes a constant value.
Similarly, the increase in the voltage from 5200 µs to 5800
µs indicates the transient during the injector closure. The
time delay between the start of the peak phase and the
injector opening is equal to about 200 microseconds, which
is a typical value for a CR injector (Stumpp and Ricco,
1996).
The reliability of the optical sensor was further assessed
by several experimental tests during which the coil of the
injector was provided with different current profiles that
are typical both of pilot injections and of main ones. The
pressure acting on the needle was measured by means of
the pressure transducer shown in Figure 14 and its time
history was recorded and used to validate the proposed
optical sensor.
Figures 16 ~ 18 report the time histories of the lift
voltage signal, of the nozzle pressure and of the current in
the coil obtained during three injections with the rail
pressure being set to 400 bar, 900 bar and 1050 bar,
respectively. Figure 16 refers to a main injection with a
peak current of 19 A, while Figures 17 and 18 refer to two
pilot injections with a peak current of 16 A and 17 A,
respectively.
The comparison among the curves of the current,
pressure and lift reported in Figures 16 ~ 18 confirms the
effectiveness of the proposed optical sensor. In fact, it is
possible to observe the correspondence between the large
decrease in the voltage, which indicates the needle lift, and
the large pressure drop in the nozzle, caused by the sudden
opening of the injector. Furthermore, as expected, the
voltage drop that indicates the opening phase increases
with the rail pressure (see Figures 17 and 18). In fact, the
greater the rail pressure, the higher the needle lift and, as
shown by the voltage curves, the longer the closing phase.
It is also possible to observe the typical pressure
oscillations occurring in the nozzle after the closing of the
injector.
Similarly, Figures 19 ~ 21 refer to three Main injections
that differ from one another because different values of
energizing time (peak + hold), peak & hold currents and
rail pressure, whose values strongly affect the opening of
the injector, were employed.
The different duration of the opening phase (from 3600
µs to 6700 µs in Figure 20 and from 3500 µs to 7200 µs in
Figure 21) is due to its strong dependence on the overall
energizing time, which was changed from 1100 µs (Figure
20) to 1500 µs (Figure 21).
Figures 22 and 23 report other measurements obtained
with two main injections, performed with quite similar
current profiles and energising time but with a large
difference in the rail pressure (400 bar and 900 bar,
respectively). As shown by the comparison of the two
graphs, the higher rail pressure makes the voltage fall (i.e.
starting lift) faster, because of the bigger force acting on the
needle. In both cases, the voltage signal is again consistent
with the expected behaviour of the needle, evidencing the
reliability and accuracy of the proposed optical sensor once
more. As additional information, it is also possible to
observe the typical pressure oscillation in the nozzle
(Catalano et al., 2002; Amirante et al., 2006) which is due
to the propagation of the compression waves that are
created by the opening and closing of the injector, e.g. see
Figure 16 (the pressure increases from 4500 µs to 5000 µs
and decreases from 5000 µs to 6000 µs and so on).
As visible in Figures 16 to 23, the signal of the control
piston displacement does not maintain a constant value but
presents small fluctuations around a mean value; this can
be attributed to the corresponding pressure oscillations
shown in the same figures. These pressure oscillations can
also be fed by downstream cavitation processes from
which reverse pressure waves may be propagated. The
pressure trends shown in Figures 16 to 23 are consistent
with the expected behaviour of the pressure inside the
nozzle; in fact, the pressure trends are very similar to those
registered in a previous experimental campaign (Amirante
et al., 2006), in which the goal was to demonstrate the reliability of the nozzle pressure measurement in a
commercial injector (without implementing the proposed
optical system). More explanations for the pressure trends
and associated phenomena are provided by Amirante et al.
(2006).
Similar oscillations both in the lift of the control piston
and in the injected mass flow rate were also encountered by
other authors during tests of commercial injectors (Seykens
et al., 2004; Suh and Lee, 2008); their explanation for such
oscillations is the occurrence of cavitation associated with
a rapid opening and closing of the injector which induce
pressure waves (Seykens et al., 2004, 2005).
In order to evaluate whether the optical sensor is capable
of providing reliable measurements even for different
injector geometries, the control piston was replaced with
another one, having a smaller diameter of the upper part
(the difference from the original one is two hundredths of
millimetres). Figures 24 and 25 report the signals recorded
during two injections, which were characterized by a
similar current profile but with different rail pressures (650
and 850 bar, respectively), both performed with the
modified control piston. The comparison shows that, as
mentioned earlier, the higher rail pressure causes both the
faster lift of the needle and the longer duration of the
closing phase: it is noteworthy that both are accurately
predicted by the optical sensor. Furthermore, the smaller
diameter of the upper part of the new control piston causes
leakage losses in the control chamber and hence the
slowdown in the filling process through the “Z” orifice (see
Figure 1); as a result, a slowdown in the needle closure is
also expected. Even this behaviour is well reproduced by
the optical sensor, in fact it is seen that the slope of the
voltage signal during the closing phase of Figures 24 and
25 is lower than that of the previous figures.
Finally, additional tests were successfully performed by
simulating multiple injections, in order to demonstrate the
reliability of the proposed sensor in each possible scenario
of the injection process. Even in this case, the optical
sensor provided the same excellent results; as an example,
Figure 26 reports the signals recorded during multiple
injections (3 injection strategy) performed with the second
control piston.
With regard to the multiple injections technology, the
importance of the optical sensor must further be remarked
because such reliable measurements can allow the values
of dwell times to be accurately chosen in order to optimize
the performance of Multi-jet injection systems
3.2. Numerical Validation of the Experimental Tests
Although it has widely been demonstrated that the nozzle
pressure is strongly connected to the needle position
(Stumpp and Ricco, 1996), and hence the previous analysis
(based on the comparison between time histories of the
nozzle pressure and lift measurements) can be considered a
reliable tool for the validation of the optical sensor, the
reliability of the sensor was further assessed by the
comparison between the experimental data and the
numerical predictions provided by a numerical model of
the injector.
In the last years, several accurate models for the
simulation of high pressure Diesel injection systems were
proposed in the scientific literature (Marcer et al., 2010;
Seykens et al., 2005; Liu and Wang, 2012) in order to
predict the dynamic behaviour of injectors. Also in this
case, the numerical model of the Common Rail injector
was developed by means of the AMESim Software
(Advanced Modelling Environment for Simulation
(AMESim, 2004) with the aim of accurately reproducing
the hydraulic and mechanical layout, since it is well known
that the layout of the system and its geometrical features
strongly affect the injection process. The choice of
AMESim is justified by its capability of reproducing
physical phenomena with great accuracy, allowing the
realization of a model as similar as possible to the real
system (Marcer et al., 2010; Seykens et al., 2005; Liu and
Wang, 2012).
The injector behaviour is assumed one dimensional, and
a lumped parameter model is considered. The model also
accounts for the cavitation phenomenon, since cavitation
influences the control piston lift (Ficarella et al., 1999;
Giannadakis et al., 2008).
With regard to the cavition model, AMESim uses the
same approach as that described by Seykens et al. (2005),
which takes into account the occurrence of cavitation by
only reducing the discharge coefficient (defined as the ratio
of the actual flow rate to the maximum theoretical flow
rate). In particular, the discharge coefficient within a
metering section is changed according to the cavitation
number, which is a non-dimensional parameter indicating
the expected cavitation intensity. The AMESim cavitation
model has proved to be very accurate, as shown by
different studies present in the literature (Seykens et al.,
2004, 2005).
Both the combustion chamber pressure, downstream of
the nozzle, and the rail pressure are held constant. The
latter was set constant since it is subjected to variations
whose duration is much longer than the injection time
(Amirante et al., 2006).
With regard to the forces acting during the injection
process, the model takes into account the electromagnetic
forces (relevant to the activation and control of the
injector), the internal forces between the needle and the
control piston, the pressure forces exerted by the oil in the
control and delivery chambers and, finally, the external
elastic force generated by the centring spring of the
solenoid valve. The good accuracy of the model, according
to the common scientific approach (Marcer et al., 2010;
Seykens et al., 2005; Liu and Wang, 2012), allows the
above listed actions to be reproduced with good precision.
Figure 27 shows a sketch of the AMESim model of the
Common Rail injector employed in the experimental
campaign to test the optical sensor; the correspondence
between the mechanical and electrical parts and their icons
is also depicted in detail.
The “piecewise linear” submodel was employed to
achieve the same current profiles used in the experimental
campaign for ease of comparison. The electro-hydraulic
valve was modelled by means of a solenoid, a “Mass block
with stiction and coulomb friction and end stops”, a “Ball
valve with conical seat” and a “Piston with spring”.
With regard to the control piston - needle system, the
needle (13) and the control piston (11) are considered as
two different elements separated by a spring-damper (12)
in order to account for the possible relative motion between
them, although they are expected to have the same
displacement.
Moreover, the model takes into account the fuel
compressibility during the injection.
The ducts inside the injector and the pipe connecting the
rail with the injector are modelled as undeformable by
means of the “Simple wave equation hydraulic pipe” sub
model. The rail is modelled by a “constant pressure source”
sub model.
In order to increase the accuracy of the model, the
geometrical data of the injector and the properties of the oil
(type ISO 4113) used in the experimental campaign were
considered in the simulations.
Since the numerical investigation aims at further proving
the reliability of the sensor, the comparison against the
experimental results is mainly focused on the control piston
displacement.
Figures 28 ~ 31 show the comparison between the
numerical predictions and the experimental measurements.
The red line denotes the measurement of the control piston
lift, while the green one denotes the simulated lift of the
control piston; the trend of the current (experimental
measurement) is plotted as a blue line. Figures 28 ~ 30
refer to three Main injections while Figure 31 refers to a
Pilot injection.
All these Figures show good agreement between the
experimental measurement and the simulated lift in terms
of both the rise time and the value of the lift at full opening,
and this confirms the accuracy and reliability of the optical
sensor. The numerical predictions of the lift are very
regular, following an ideal behaviour; instead, the
measured lift shows some small oscillations both during
the transient phase and at full opening. As discussed earlier,
such oscillations of the lift must be attributed to highfrequency fluctuations in the upstream pressure and
cavitation occurrence. These phenomena are not captured
by the AMESim simulations, which therefore predicted a
regular and constant lift at full opening.
The agreement between numerical predictions and
experimental values also suggests that the numerical model
can effectively be used to correctly predict both the lift at
full opening and the rise time

4. CONCLUSION
Accurate measurements of the instantaneous position of the
control piston can be instrumental in predicting the real
behavior of Common Rail injectors, in particular when
multiple injections are employed. In this paper, a cheap and
reliable optical sensor suited to measure control piston
position has been proposed and experimentally tested with
the aim of overcoming the unresolved problems
(interferences and high costs) arising from the employment
of eddy current sensors which deeply affect measurement
accuracy. The proposed optical sensor is mainly composed
of a cheap light emitting diode and a compatible photo
receiver, and it can easily be implemented in a typical
injector assembly by using simple drilling operations that
do not affect the operation of the injector and its
mechanical resistance. The injector system also needs a
few modifications to avoid the presence of fuel in the
measuring zone which could alter the accuracy of the
measurements. These modifications consist of two
additional holes and two elastomer rings, which are
necessary to avoid the presence of fuel in the optical
chamber by generating an air cushion inside the measuring
zone. The small amount of air serving as air cushion is
taken from the turbocharger; there is no reduction in the
flow rate delivered by the compressor, because the air is
“blocked” inside the metering zone. As a result, there is no
compressed air consumption and the operating conditions
of the turbocharger are not changed. These modifications,
which can be easily implemented in the manufacturing
process of a commercial injector, are not as intrusive as
those required by typical measurement systems present in
the literature. For example, the installation of an eddy
current sensor (the most used measurement system in
laboratory tests) is very complex and requires removal of
much material from the control piston, thus increasing the
mechanical weakness of the control piston (subjected to
high compression forces), in addition to being affected by
electromagnetic interference. The optical sensor was
mounted on a commercial injector and several experimental
tests were performed on a test bench to validate the
solution proposed. Different current profiles, typical of
pilot and main injections, were supplied to the coil of the
injector; the time history of the pressure acting on the
needle was recorded and was used to evaluate the validity
of the displacement signal. Similar experimental tests were
carried out with a different control piston to assess the
reliability of the measurements even for different
characteristics of the injector geometry. In all the tests, the
voltage signal from the optical sensor was consistent both
with the expected lift of the needle and with the transients
of the pressure acting on the needle, evidencing the
reliability and accuracy of the solution proposed. The
reliability of the sensor was further demonstrated by
comparing the experimental data with the numerical
predictions provided by the AMESim numerical model of
the injector. The experimental results and numerical
predictions show excellent agreement and also suggest the
possible use of the simulation model as a reliable tool for
predicting the needle lift.
The proposed optical sensor is very innovative because
its characteristics can also make its use profitable for realtime on board controls and because it is cost-effective, in
fact the overall cost of its components amounts to about
twenty Euros, while common eddy current sensors can cost
as much as a few thousand Euros.

The study described in this article is the subject of a patent
application (Patent filing October 2012, under submission for
PCT extension)ABSTRACT
This paper provides a systematic review of recent publications on simulation and analysis of integrated multi-
vector energy networks (rather than energy hubs) and carries this out through the lens of energy trilemma.
This review is essential for energy research community to move forward in effective manner toward 2050 net
zero carbon targets. This paper presents a holistic view of state-of-the-art of research in this field and identifies
gaps in knowledge which should be addressed by future research urgently. Furthermore, this paper introduces a
taxonomy of energy networks analysis, offering a unified description of findings of relatively large number of
publications devoted to the subject. Moreover, this work analyses and classifies current research trends in the
field of analysis of energy networks integration, and also identifies future trends in this field. This review serves
as a guide to researchers regarding the main findings of energy networks integration evaluated through the lens
of energy trilemma. The reviewed papers have been classified into three groups: (i) Operational analysis; (ii)
Optimal dispatch; and (iii) Optimal planning. The focus of the paper is energy networks, since they play
fundamental role in integrated energy systems and there is a lack of understanding of interactions and in-
terdependencies between multi-vector networks. Also, focus of this paper has been on key findings of published
research rather than details of individual energy models. The paper provides useful insights for energy research
community by presenting several novel ideas for future research and facilitating the path to a decarbonised
economy, due to the fulfilled comprehensive systematic review.
1. Introduction
The international aspiration to reach net zero carbon in energy sys-
tems by 2050 is growing. In the UK, the government has set a target of
‘Net Zero’ Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 in order to reduce
contribution to global warming [1]. This necessitates performing energy
evaluation through a system-of-systems approach, in order to under-
stand the intrinsic properties of the main layer/sections of the Integrated
Energy Systems (IESs), from natural resources and distribution to the
final energy user as well as the interactions and interdependencies
within each layer/section [2]. These interdependencies and interactions
occur between different energy vectors including natural gas, electricity,
cooling and heating. Energy networks are key components of the whole
energy system that transport the energy extracted from the natural re-
sources to the final energy users. Therefore, there is a growing consensus
that there is a need for a step change in research and development in
multi-energy networks and their interdependencies in order to facilitate
the path to achieving the carbon reduction targets.
Energy networks (including gas, electricity and district heating/
cooling networks) are still predominantly planned and operated sepa-
rately. However, there are several drivers for integrated planning and
operation of these networks including reduction of the use of primary
energy, increasing integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and
facilitating a low carbon economy [3]. The synergies between energy
networks [4,5] and the interdependencies and interactions between
these networks have been shown to have the potential to bring several
benefits to the integrated planning, optimal dispatch and operation of
energy networks including increasing energy conversion efficiency,
maximised utilisation of primary energy sources, improving the energy
system flexibility, resilience and security and carbon emission reduction
[3,6,7]. Modelling of IES is crucial for understanding the energy net-
works and the potential benefits of their integrated operation. Several
energy system models have been developed, which have been presented
and reviewed in the literature [3,6,8,9]. Moreover, Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) have a substantial role in IESs since
they support the coordinated operation of the system by integrating
different parts of the energy system through information sharing
frameworks [7]. Consequently, there are several complexities associated
with planning, management and operation of Integrated Energy Net-
works (IENs), which needs close collaboration of several fields of
expertise including computing science and several engineering disci-
plines to address the challenges of this multi-disciplinary field of
knowledge.
An overview of the benefits of integrated operation of energy net-
works has been carried out in Ref. [3]. However, this does not include a
significant amount of detail and does not relate the findings to the
internationally accepted concept of the energy trilemma, i.e. flexibility,
security and affordability. This greater detail and link to the trilemma is
required in order to identify gaps and directions for an appropriate
future research for meeting carbon reduction targets. To the best of the
knowledge of the authors, no other comprehensive or systematic re-
views were found, that have linked together and organised the findings
of the most important literature on the analysis of energy networks in
relation to the energy trilemma.
Slightly different definitions of the three elements of the energy tri-
lemma exist. Based on the frequency of the definitions used by the au-
thors of the reviewed papers, the following most common definitions of
the energy trilemma have been used in this paper:
(i) Flexibility of operation:
This element of the trilemma denotes how much IENs can respond to
any change in the coupled network(s), including the increase in demand,
without violation of the operational conditions or technical limits.
(ii) Security of supply:
This element of the trilemma indicates the extent that one network
vector can support (in terms of meeting the demand) the operation of
other different but coupled network vectors in the case of a fault
occurrence in part of those coupled network(s), or a shortage of supply
in those coupled network(s).
(iii) Affordability:
This element of the trilemma denotes the amount of costs associated
with the operation, dispatch or planning of the IENs. These costs include
operational and maintenance costs as well as the cost of purchase and
deployment of new assets.
It should be noted that although environmental sustainability (as an
indication of the environmental performance of IENs) has not been
explicitly considered in this definition of the energy trilemma, any
changes to the planning or operation of IENs will have impact on the
environment. In this paper, the environmental impact of any variation in
the above energy trilemma elements are also investigated and evaluated.
It should be noted that the aforementioned definition of the energy
trilemma is in line with the goal number 7 (‘affordable and clean en-
ergy’) of Sustainable Development Goals. This goal aims to ensure access
to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.
Several vectors are incorporated in multi-vector IENs including
natural gas, electricity, heating, cooling and hydrogen. Table 1 shows
the possible coupling components between the vectors that were
frequently investigated in the literature, i.e. gas, electricity and heat. As
can be seen from the table, almost all these vectors, i.e. gas, electricity
and heat, can be converted into another vector and vice versa. This also
shows that these networks can impact the operation of the coupled
network(s). For example, the electricity network can impact the opera-
tion of the gas network: (i) either through electricity to gas conversion
units (Power-to-Gas (P2G), electrolyser and electric driven gas com-
pressors); or (ii) through gas to electricity conversion units (Combined
Heat and Power (CHP) and gas turbine). Therefore, these bring both
benefits and challenges to the operation of the IENs in terms of the el-
ements of the energy trilemma as follows:
(i) Flexibility of operation:
Benefits include, optimal scheduling and planning of the networks for
minimum costs and carbon emissions, and optimised utilisation of the
available assets. Challenges include unexpected potentially negative
impact of networks on one another in case of malfunctioning of the
coupling components and hence losing some energy and increasing the
costs and carbon emissions;
(ii) Security of supply:
Benefits include, availability of any form of energy in any network to
meet the unexpected increased demand in the coupled network(s), and
mutual support between network(s) in case of faults in some part of
them or shortage of supply from upstream or from limited natural re-
sources. Challenges include: (a) the optimal placement of the coupling
components to ensure the security of supply; and (b) networks may not
be able to support the coupled network(s) in case of malfunctioning of
the available coupling components;
(iii) Affordability:
Benefits include, reduction of costs either through capturing and
converting renewable energy via different coupling components into
any of the coupled networks, or through optimised utilisation of avail-
able assets. Challenges include increase in costs due to load shedding or
due to malfunctioning of the coupling components.
There are economic and environmental benefits associated with in-
tegrated operation of the networks through these coupling components.
As an example, it was shown that introduction of P2G in the national gas
and electricity transmission networks of Great Britain had reduced the
costs by £35 M and reduced the carbon emissions by 250 kton during a
month [10]. However, it should be noted that these figures cannot be
generalised since they depend on several factors, including the scale of
the networks, the load profile condition (summer or winter), the ca-
pacity and number of available coupling components and storage
devices.
In order to integrate the networks, through utilising the coupling
components listed in Table 1, the following technical interventions are
required: sizing and operating the coupling components optimally.
Operating the coupling components also requires data acquisition sys-
tems, in which the associated data need to be shared with the control
room(s) of different network vectors. This challenging intervention will
be discussed in Section 4. Also, among the technologies that are pre-
sented in Table 1, the ones that are underrepresented in this paper, can
be considered as potential areas for further work.
In this paper, the most important findings drawn from the literature,
on analysis of energy networks, rather than energy hubs, fall in to the
following three categories:
(i) Operational analysis:
This area denotes assessing the operational conditions of the net-
works and ensuring the networks are meeting the demand without
violating the operational limits, i.e. ensuring the voltages in the elec-
tricity network, the pressures in the gas network and pressures and
temperatures in the District Heating Network (DHN) are all within
acceptable and operable ranges. Once, this assessment has been carried
out, a picture of the operation of the network in terms of the power flows
in the electricity network, gas flows in the gas network, and hot water
flows in the DHN is obtained. Then, the final step is to evaluate the
Techno-Economic-Environmental (TEE) performance of the IEN.
(ii) Optimal dispatch:
Optimal dispatch denotes the optimal operational scheduling of
IENs, which is normally performed for the next few hours. This means in
order to meet the demand with the least operational costs (objective
function), how much (amount and scheduling) energy from different
sources needs to be supplied, or how much the amount and scheduling of
different energy conversion units (coupling components) needs to be.
Optimal dispatch also considers the operability of the IEN. Additionally,
the environmental performance is either considered as an element in the
objective function along with the operational costs, or as a constraint.
Hence, optimal dispatch performs an optimal TEE operational sched-
uling of IENs.
(iii) Optimal planning:
Optimal planning denotes investment planning of all the assets of
IENs, including pipes in the gas and district heating networks, cables and
generation units in the electricity network, and coupling components,
for a horizon of time, e.g. next 20 years. In this respect, all the capital
and operational costs (mapped to a base year) will be minimised in order
for the IEN to meet all the current and future demand subject to being
operable and optimally dispatched at all the time snap shots. Similar to
optimal dispatch, the environmental performance is either considered in
the objective function along with all the costs or as a constraint.
Therefore, optimal planning carries out the optimal TEE operational
planning of the IEN for meeting the current and future demand.
In order to provide guidance for engineers and researchers regarding
the operational analysis, optimal dispatch and optimal planning of IENs,
the selected articles in the related field published predominantly in the
last five years are reviewed. The key findings in these articles are ana-
lysed and categorised covering a range of different aspects, which are
linked to the aforementioned energy trilemma elements, i.e. flexibility
of operation, security of supply, affordability. Additionally, a compre-
hensive review of the problem formulation and solving algorithms for
optimal planning and optimal dispatch of IENs has been carried out.
Consequently, the comprehensive systematic review presented in this
paper provides a holistic picture of the state-of-the-art of research in this
extensive field and identifies useful insights, directions, and guidelines
for valuable future applied research in pursuit of the low carbon
transition.
The papers on energy hubs were not considered since hub level
analysis does not consider the operation of the network to ensure the
network is physically operable and is able to meet the load without
violation of operational constraints (see Refs. [11,12] for review of en-
ergy hubs). Also, the focus of this paper is on findings rather than the
energy models since the models developed for simulation and analysis of
IENs have been reviewed in several other literature [3,6,8,9].
The structure of the paper is as follows: section 2 explains the
methodology adopted and describes the way the publications summar-
ised in this paper were identified. Also, key characteristics of published
research were categorised and key findings are described in this section.
Section 3 describes the most important findings of the papers around the
elements of energy trilemma, in three subsections corresponding to the
three key categories of operational analysis, optimal dispatch and
optimal planning. Section 4 presents several directions for valuable
future applied research in optimal planning, optimal dispatch and
operational analysis of IENs. Finally, section 5 concludes the insights of
the paper.
2. Methodology
This section explains the methodology adopted in this paper to find
the published research on analysis of IENs. Also, key characteristics of
published research were categorised and key findings are described. For
this purpose, databases including IEEEXplore, Sciencedirect and Scopus
were searched with the following key words in their title or keywords:
- A combination of two of: ‘gas’, ‘heat’, ‘power’/‘electric’
- ‘multi-energy’, ‘multi-vector’, ‘integrated energy systems’, or ‘inte-
grated energy networks’
- ‘energy system’ or ‘energy network’
Among the resulting papers, the ones based on a model of energy
networks, rather than based on a model of energy hubs, were considered
since energy hubs are already reviewed in Ref. [11,12]. Then, an
assessment was carried out and hence the papers were filtered further
and the ones: (i) with reasonable citations; (ii) from influential re-
searchers in this field; (iii) published in prestigious journals or presented
in credible conferences; and (iv) that were rigorous, most interesting and
complete, were selected to be reviewed in this paper. Given the fact that
English is a universal language, whilst considering only the papers
written in English, a homogenous cover of the research on analysis of
IENs, that is carried out in the world, is captured in this paper. Also,
several papers had performed analysis of a single vector (i.e. gas, elec-
tricity or heat) as well as the point(s) of connection to the network of
other vector(s) and the impact of those networks without considering
the operation of those coupled network(s). Those papers were excluded
since the scope of this paper is multi-vector energy networks. In this
way, the authors are confident that the most important and influential
papers on analysis of energy networks that have been published in the
well-known databases have been captured and scanned in this review.
Once the papers were filtered according to the aforementioned
eligibility criteria, 186 papers were considered to be reviewed in this
paper. Fig. 1 shows that 115 journal papers and 71 conference papers,
with majority of 59 IEEE conference papers, were investigated. Fig. 2
illustrates the share of different journals on publishing the reviewed
papers on analysis of IENs. These two figures show the majority of the
reviewed papers are published in prestigious journals and conferences.
Fig. 3 shows the number of the papers from different countries according
to the affiliation of the first author of these papers, which indicates the
importance of this topic for different countries around the world. As can
be seen, the majority of these papers have been published by the re-
searchers from China (72), UK (31), United States (17) and Iran (12).
The rest of the countries have less than 10 publications.
As shown above, the geographical coverage of the literature review
was diverse and extensive but not exhaustive. However, it should be
noted that the three categories listed above deal with issues that are
applicable to all the energy networks regardless of their vector or
geographical location and whether they are dealing with legacy net-
works or new build infrastructure. It is possible that some issues specific
to developing countries may not have been identified in this review but
these are likely to be driven by commercial or regulatory aspects which
are not the focus of this paper. Therefore, it is reasonable to claim that
the findings from this review have global relevance and value.
These 186 papers were classified into each of the groups below ac-
cording to their models, research questions and scenarios:
- Papers on operational analysis [13–54].
- Papers on optimal dispatch [10,55–157]
- Papers on optimal planning [158–200].
Fig. 4 shows the number of papers found in the above three groups
published in journals and conferences (denoted by ‘conf.’ in the figure)
by year for the last five years. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the total
number of papers published in these three groups has increased in recent
years especially for optimal dispatch and optimal planning groups. In
these three groups, 82.9%, 82.5%, and 80.9% of the reviewed papers,
respectively, are published in the last five years.
3. Classification of IEN analysis methods and key findings
In this section, the methods for IEN analysis adopted in the reviewed
papers for operational analysis, optimal dispatch and optimal planning
of IENs, the algorithms developed and implemented for formulation and
solution of the problem and the key findings of these publications
around the elements of energy trilemma are presented.
The aspects that were more frequently investigated in the papers are
shown in diagrams in Fig. 5 for operational analysis, in Fig. 6 for optimal
dispatch and in Fig. 7 for optimal planning of IENs. These aspects were
identified based on the keywords of the findings of the papers. All these
aspects have impact on analysis of the performance of IENs in terms of
the elements of energy trilemma, i.e. flexibility, security and afford-
ability. The proximity of any of the aspects to any of the above elements
of energy trilemma in Figs. 5–7 does not mean that aspect has more
impact on that element of energy trilemma. Also, the darker the arrow
connecting the aspect to the whole energy trilemma, the more frequent
the appearance and discussion of the aspect in the reviewed papers, as
shown by the legend in these figures.
Among these aspects, the ones that were discussed more frequently
than the others in the papers are described below Figs. 5–7 in separate
paragraphs. It should be noted that ‘Affordability’, is included in almost
all the paragraphs and hence has not been summarised exclusively in
one separate paragraph similar to the other elements of energy
trilemma.
The references that have validated their developed model by
comparing the results of their model with reference data, measurements
or a commercial tool without any scenarios or key findings are not
explained in the sub-sections of this section, since they have not
demonstrated the evolving scenarios to address the energy trilemma.
Also, the results and findings of the papers that are not cited in the ‘Key
findings’ sections (i.e. sections 3.1.2, 3.2.2 and 3.3.2) were not related to
the subjects discussed more frequently in majority of the papers.
Therefore, although some of the papers are scanned and mentioned in
the ‘Methodology’ section, they are not cited in terms of their results and
findings, in order to maintain the organisation of the paper. This is due
to the fact that the purpose of this review is to summarise the most
important findings of the available publications in relation to the
elements of energy trilemma. Additionally, the findings presented in this
section have been taken from the clear statements in the papers and are
not the personal perception of the authors.
3.1. Operational analysis
3.1.1. Problem formulation and solving
The problem of operational analysis is to calculate the values of state
parameters in an IEN, i.e. voltages in electricity, pressures in gas and
mass flow rates and temperatures in heat/cooling networks. Once the
values of the state parameters are calculated, the values of energy flows
within the IEN are obtained. In this way, a suitable understanding of the
performance of the IEN in terms of energy trilemma and operability of
the IEN without violation of operational constraints is obtained.
In order to perform operational analysis, the set of equations of
balance of power/gas flows at the buses/nodes of the electricity/gas
network are formed. Then, the equations are re-written in terms of the
state parameters in each network.
For the heating or cooling networks, the set of equations of balance
of mass flow rate of hot or cold water at the nodes, the correlation be-
tween mass flow rate, load, and difference of temperature at the loads
and the equations for losses of heat in the pipes are formed. These
equations already contain the state parameters of heating or cooling
network.
Regarding the coupling components, since the value of the energy
flow on one side is known and input to the problem, the value on the
other side can be calculated and considered as the load or generation in
the corresponding network.
In order to solve the set of nonlinear equations most of the papers
have explicitly mentioned they have used Newton-Raphson method.
This is due to the fact that this method finds the problem solution with
local quadratic convergence irrespective of the size of the network
provided all the state variables are initialised with suitable values and
the Jacobian matrix is not singular at the solution point [201,202]. Once
the set of equations is solved, the values of state parameters in all the
networks and consequently the power/gas/hot or cold water flows in all
the branches of the IEN are determined.
In this way, it is possible to examine if the IEN is physically operable.
Also, it is possible to evaluate the performance of the IEN in terms of the
energy trilemma.
A summary of the popular methods used by the research community
for problem formulation and problem solving for operational analysis of
IENs is presented in Table 2. It can be seen that the problem can be
formulated either as: (i) sequential, in which the model of each network
is solved separately and the impact of coupling components is consid-
ered as load or source for the other network; or (ii) integrated, in which
the models of integrated networks with the coupling components are
considered as one model and solved as a whole.
3.1.2. Key findings
3.1.2.1. Flexibility of operation. Flexibility, as one of the elements of
energy trilemma, has been discussed frequently in the papers. There are
several options that provide flexibility to the operation of IENs, as
follows:
(i) Line pack storage, which is the amount of gas stored in a pipeline,
is one of the options that provide flexibility to the gas network as
well as to the other coupled networks. The difference between the
upper and lower line pack limits of the pipes (ΔLP) and the
amplitude of the line pack swing, impact the line pack flexibility.
In a ‘Gas based heating’ scenario studied in Ref. [13] it was found
that high heat demand levels lead to a reduction in ΔLP, and
hence to a reduction in the flexibility of the gas network. In this
scenario, these high heat demands also led to an increase in the
magnitude of the line pack swing. Therefore, the heat demand
levels need to be taken into account in order to evaluate the
flexibility of IEN operation. The method developed in Ref. [13] to
assess the flexibility may be used in scheduling of operation of
transmission network. Hence, it is possible to quantify the flexi-
bility in different regions using weather forecasts of day-ahead.
(ii) P2G facilities, which provide flexibility to the IEN especially at
higher levels of wind generation, reduce the power losses and
fluctuations of gas pressure [14]. These facilities, which are
alternative to gas network reinforcement, effectively benefit the
operation of both electricity and gas networks. This is due to the
fact that they contribute to the reduction of wind curtailment and
to the relief of congestion in the electricity network as well as in
the coupled networks to decrease the insecurity risks [15,16].
(iii) Any form of storage devices offers flexibility to the operation of
IENs. Different types of energy storage systems that are utilised in
gas, electricity and district heating networks are summarised in
Table 3. All these different forms provide support, in terms of
flexibility of operation, security of supply and affordability, to the
network that is utilising the storage device directly, as well as to
all the network(s) coupled to this network through coupling
components. It is shown in Ref. [17] that the heat networks can
be considered as thermal storage devices to some extent and
provide flexibility to other coupled network(s) through the qua-
si-dynamic 2  interactions, which can be used in security
enhancement. It is found that in smart energy systems, proper
control strategies, which have large influences on the
quasi-dynamic interactions, should be developed to use these
interactions for increasing IEN flexibility [17].
(iv) Compressors with dual flow capability can provide flexibility to
the IEN in order to accommodate the changes in supply in any of
the networks [18].
3.1.2.2. Security of supply.Security of supply is another element of
energy trilemma and is investigated frequently in the papers. It was
shown that IENs support one another in the case of occurrence of faults,
however, at a higher cost and emission condition [19]. It was demon-
strated that these faults can propagate from one network to the other
coupled networks and cause risks to the IEN operation [20]. Several
options were proposed in the literature in order to reduce the risk of
occurrence of faults and improve the security of operation of IENs, as
follows:
(i) Electrification: Electrification of heat and especially using hybrid
heating technologies can result in great reductions in GHG
emission of electricity and heat sectors and reduce conventional
generation peaks [21], which in turn contributes to the secure
operation of the IEN. It was suggested that a mixed combination
of technologies at district and local levels needs to be considered
to meet techno-economic and environmental performance targets
as well as to minimise the influence on the constraints of the local
network [22].
(ii) Storage: Adding storage in weak parts of the networks is an
effective way to decrease operational insecurity and strengthen
the system [23].
(iii) Correlations of pipeline parameters: Accurate estimation of dis-
tributions and correlations of pipeline parameters need to be
considered in order to reduce potential risks to operation of IENs
[24].
(iv) Operation mode of coupling components: The operation mode
influences the energy flows and IEN operation [25]. For example,
at the conditions of high heat demand, a CHP unit in the heat load
following mode may generate great amount of electricity and
export it to the grid and hence negatively impact the security of
supply of the IEN [26]. Considering all the above points can avoid
load contingency, which produces frequency deviation and gen-
eration re-dispatch that in turn changes the energy flow profiles
in the IEN that could cause critical operational condition for the
IEN [27].
3.1.2.3. Aspects impacting the energy trilemma
3.1.2.3.1. Interdependencies. Interdependencies and coupling com-
ponents of IEN allow for IEN to have interactions through these com-
ponents [28]. Disturbance from one network transmits to the other
coupled networks through these conversion components [17]. Also, high
loads in one network influence the energy flows of the coupled networks
through these coupling components [26]. Additionally, conversion
technologies at different levels in IEN significantly affect the
multi-energy flows in all the coupled networks, and subsequently the
IEN emissions and operational costs [22]. The influence of in-
terdependencies on the reliability of the IEN has been studied. Imple-
mentation of gas Demand Response (DR) provided additional resilience
for the gas network and the IEN, or gas storage increased the IEN reli-
ability [21]. Increasing the number/capacity of coupling components
will increase the impacts of failures in the gas network on the electricity
network in terms of decrease in the reliability of the electricity network
[29]. Moreover, failures in the electricity network can affect the reli-
ability of gas network when the power supply of facilities in gas network
is satisfied by electricity. Also, decrease in generation capacity in the
electricity network can significantly reduce the reliability of the coupled
gas network [29]. Failure in the electricity network was shown to
eventually have an effect on the gas system. However, due to the slow
dynamics of gas system, the failure in gas system will not be transmitted
to the coupled electricity network rapidly [30]. The heat generation
technology mix affects both gas and electricity networks as well as their
interaction and has impact on the overall IEN operational costs and
carbon footprint [31]. CHP units reduce the impact of voltage drop on
electricity networks [28] and CHP units with lower heat to electricity
ratios have a greater impact on the reduction of IEN losses, due to the
fact that the reduction in electric losses that CHP units provide out-
weighs the increase in gas losses [32].
3.1.2.3.2. Uncertainty. Uncertainty within IENs was another topic
investigated in the papers. There are several sources of uncertainty
within IENs including renewable energy output, the random outage of
generation units, and the random fluctuation of the loads. It was shown
that increase in the uncertainty range of these factors leads to great
fluctuation of the state variables of the nearby buses/nodes [33]. One of
the most important sources of uncertainty is uncertainty of wind, which
was studied in several papers. It was found that uncertainty of wind
leads to significant risks to the operational security of natural gas sys-
tems [34,35] and consequently to the security of real-time operation of
IENs [36].
3.1.2.3.3. Integrated modelling. Investigation of modelling aspects of
IENs in the papers have shown that all the networks need to be simulated
and analysed in an integrated manner. This is due to the fact that a
disturbance in one system can influence the other coupled systems.
Moreover, the disturbance propagates back to the system where it
initially occurred. Thus, a combined analysis of an IES is required, even
if the aim is to investigate the influences on the system itself where the
problem occurred [37]. Therefore, there is a need for integrated IEN
studies and energy system assessment for the evaluation of system
resilience [18] or system flexibility [13]. Additionally, it was shown that
in short term operation, steady-state gas flow models could provide less
accurate results due to the real-time imbalances of gas flow [36].
Therefore, dynamic or quasi-dynamic simulation needs to be imple-
mented especially in order to quantify the process of interactions be-
tween IENs [17].
3.2. Optimal dispatch
3.2.1. Problem formulation and solving
The problem of optimal dispatch in IENs is normally formulated as a
classical optimisation problem with the objective of minimisation of
operational costs or equivalently maximisation of social welfare subject
to operational constraints as shown in Equations.(1–3).
A summary of the popular methods used by the research community
for problem formulation and problem solving for optimal dispatch of
IENs is presented in Table 4.
3.2.2. Key findings
3.2.2.1. Flexibility of operation. Flexibility of operation of IEN was the
most important and frequent aspect investigated in the references. It was
shown that co-optimisation of IENs rather than optimisation of indi-
vidual networks separate from the other network(s) improves the
economy and flexibility of the IEN [101,104]. Also, different types of
energy storage devices in IENs contribute to the flexible operation of the
networks [87]. Inclusion of multi-type storage has also the benefit of
reducing the operational uncertainty and the operational costs of IENs
introduced by network constraints [105]. Additionally, comparison of
impact of P2G and DR in terms of impact on improving the flexibility has
shown that P2G has a greater impact compared to DR in terms of
improving the flexibility of IENs [106]. Furthermore, it was observed
that multi-directional compressors provide additional flexibility to the
gas network and hence reduce total operational costs and gas load
curtailment as a result of the network flexibility they offer [77]. One of
the options for GHG emission reduction that is gaining great attention, is
electrification of heat. However, it was shown that increasing flexibility
of the electricity network is necessary for electrification of heating for
GHG reduction purposes [57]. This flexibility can be provided by inte-
gration of heating system and gas system with the electricity system in
order to accommodate fluctuations in the electricity system [74]. The
dynamic of gas and line pack capabilities in gas networks can provide
flexibility and reliability for electricity networks in IEN short-term
operation [59].
3.2.2.2. Security of supply. Security of supply, and matching the supply
and demand, are important aspects discussed in the papers. Importance
of the integration of systems in terms of operation, planning, security
and reliability was investigated [95]. It was shown that combining gas
and electricity networks is important to evaluate energy conversion
between networks to minimise risk, ensure IEN security, and match
supply with demand whilst minimising cost for transmission [107].
Also, the security constraints of the gas network place limitations on the
IEN operation [108]. Additionally, it was found that while dynamic gas
system control and increased coordination of IEN each provide benefits,
both are essential for security and reduced operational costs in high
stress conditions [91]. Furthermore, it was shown that a natural gas
shortage will limit electricity generation of gas-fired units and increase
the total operational cost of the electricity network significantly [109].
Moreover, dual-fuel electricity generation units will consume an alter-
native and even more expensive fuel such as coal in order not to violate
the operational security constraints [110].
3.2.2.3. Aspects impacting the energy trilemma
3.2.2.3.1. Storage. Storage in IENs was another topic discussed in
several papers. In addition to provision of flexibility to the IEN, as dis-
cussed previously, storage in IEN decreases load curtailments and im-
proves IEN resilience against contingencies [100]. Gas storage in
particular is more effective in managing congested IEN [70] and could
greatly reduce shedding and operational costs [85], enhance system
resilience [71], and support the operation of IEN [85]. Additionally, it
was shown that gas storage in an IEN heavily dependent on gas imports
for electricity generation has the ability to hugely reduce the operational
costs of the coupled electricity network [56]. Furthermore, it was shown
that thermal storage has the benefits of reduction in total operational
cost, improving IEN reliability and capability in accommodating more
renewables [111]. Integrated analysis rather than analysis of individual
system separate from the other(s) is beneficial since it showed gas
storage led to decrease in electricity imports in extreme weather con-
ditions [56]. Also, storage could offer greater and safer use of the
hydrogen in the gas network [10].
3.2.2.3.2. Line pack. Line pack was another topic discussed in the
papers. Apart from being an intrinsic property of gas networks, which
contributes to the flexibility of gas networks and consequently to IEN as
discussed previously, it was shown that line pack also plays an important
role in balancing the production and consumption [90] and contributes
to reduction of costs and more economical dispatch [112]. The higher
the line pack of the system, the lower operational costs to meet the
demand [59]. Additionally, it was demonstrated the lower the line pack,
the more the gas supplied from other sources and storages, and hence
the more IEN operational costs [64]. In order to simulate the line pack
storage and investigate the time evolution of it, dynamic gas flow
models instead of steady state models need to be implemented [113]. In
this way, it is possible to assess the amount of line pack storage in each
single pipe [90]. This also provides the basis for studying security of
supply [113], which can be carried out by varying the gas supply profile
over the day and hence controlling and simulating the line pack and
pressures [114]. Another benefit of application of dynamic gas models is
in studying coordinated scheduling since steady-state gas models ignore
gas inertia and line pack. This may result in suboptimal or less accurate
short-term co-ordinated scheduling of IEN [112].
3.2.2.3.3. P2G. P2G was the most frequent coupling component
that was investigated in the papers. It was found that P2G facilities have
several benefits including mitigating congestion of gas network as well
as the IEN [10,90], avoiding wind curtailment [115], supplying gas
demand and improving wind accommodation [74,90], reduction of
operational costs of gas networks [115,116] and IEN [98,108,117,118],
reduction of IEN emissions [108,115] and enhancing the capability of
the IEN in comprehensive utilisation efficiency of energy [98,108]. The
above benefits allow for additional resilience in ability of the gas
network to provide the minimum required offtake pressure [10]. The
location of these P2G facilities has impact on their role [90]. P2G units
can support more cost-effective unit commitment scheduling by avoid-
ing the curtailment of surplus wind generation and converting it into
natural gas [96] and hence decrease revenue deficit at higher P2G ef-
ficiencies [102]. Furthermore, combined operation of the P2G and gas
turbine units can effectively weaken the under/over voltage issues
[102].
3.2.2.3.4. Renewable  generation. Although  different  types  of
renewable generation, including wind and PV, have been investigated,
wind generation has been more frequently explored in the papers
compared to other types of renewable generation. Wind generation is a
highly accessible option for decarbonising electricity and heat demands.
It was shown that the electricity generation costs and eventually IEN
operational costs reduce as the penetration of wind generation increases
[89,119]. Also, increased levels of uncertainty of wind generation lead
to increased levels of uncertainty of operational costs of IEN [60] and
hence to the higher system generation costs [120]. The disadvantages of
low wind penetration levels include more supply to gas turbine power
plants, more import of expensive electricity, less line pack and flexibility
in the gas network, more compressor power consumption and eventually
higher IEN operational costs especially in high demand conditions [61].
Several solutions were suggested for reduction of curtailment of wind
generation including: (i) P2G units can convert most of the surplus wind
into gas and heat [74]. However, due to high operational cost of P2G, to
ensure the benefit for both the wind farm and the IEN, cost-benefit
trade-off needs to be carried out between wind generation level and
IEN operational economy [103]. (ii) Producing hydrogen from elec-
tricity reduces wind curtailment in a high wind case and decreases
operational costs, GHG emissions and gas flow from gas sources [63]. It
was suggested to produce hydrogen at high wind regions by locating
electrolysers in those regions [63]. (iii) Increasing the heat pump ca-
pacity gradually decreases the rate of wind curtailment [121]. Also,
analysis of impact of correlation coefficients between different wind
farms on the operational costs showed that if the correlation coefficients
between wind farms are larger, the IEN operational costs will be larger
too [87].
3.2.2.3.5. Co-ordinated scheduling. Co-ordinated scheduling of inte-
grated networks was investigated in several papers. Comparison of co-
ordinated scheduling with co-ordination of networks separate from
one another showed that the case of co-ordinated scheduling leads to
lower emission and operational costs [122] and stays within the oper-
ational constraints especially with higher cost savings at higher load
levels [67]. A study with DR found that co-ordinated gas-electricity DR
achieves a better IEN economy than single electricity DR or single nat-
ural gas DR [60]. Additionally, it was shown that co-ordinated sched-
uling, which can better handle the inaccuracy of forecasting [73], could
help the IENs relieve a contingency in one network, which also impacts
operation of the other coupled networks, with lower operational costs
compared to non-co-ordinated scheduling [68]. To ensure all the
aforementioned benefits of co-ordinated scheduling, gas and electricity
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need to closely collaborate and
co-ordinate [113], which is further discussed in section 4.
3.3. Optimal planning
3.3.1. Problem formulation and solving
The mathematical model for optimal planning of IENs is similar to
traditional planning of gas, electricity or heat networks, which can be
formulated as a typical optimisation problem. However, compared with
the traditional approach, there are more decision variables, more
comprehensive objectives, more complex constraints, and higher
uncertainty levels in planning models of IENs.
A problem of optimal planning is formulated with the target of
minimisation of Net Present Value (NPV) of sum of all the expansion
costs consisting of investment costs (or capital costs, CAPEX) and
operational costs (OPEX), or maximisation of NPV of social welfare of
IEN over the planning horizon subject to operational and investment
constraints, as follows:
Elements of the energy trilemma are considered either in the
objective function or in the constraints to link the models to the analysis
and scenarios.
A summary of the popular methods used by the research community
for problem formulation and problem solving for optimal planning of
IENs is presented in Table 5.
3.3.2. Key findings
3.3.2.1. Flexibility of operation. It was shown that all the energy storage
systems contribute in the long term to avoid energy deficiency and
hence to increase economic savings [177]. Among different storage
types, additional gas storage facilities could enhance gas availability and
line pack during periods of high gas load levels [165]. Also, gas storage
devices are effective in mitigating the impact of uncertainty of the de-
mand on the long-term planning of IENs and in enhancing the security of
energy supply [169]. It was found that in the co-planning, line pack
varies and decreases more in high load conditions [167]. Also, P2G units
can support IENs to benefit from more RESs penetration, delay elec-
tricity transmission lines construction [190], decrease costs and emis-
sions, and increase heat profit of IENs [198]. Additionally, compressors
can postpone building gas pipelines and hence decrease IEN costs [190].
3.3.2.2. Aspects impacting the energy trilemma. It was found that heat
demand needs to be considered in operational planning of the flexibility
of IENs [13]. Also, in order to consider the uncertain future demand and
generation, stochastic solutions need to be investigated, which present
the lowest expected cost for this purpose [176], and hence does not
result in any load curtailment [164]. It was also found that demand
uncertainty impacts the operational cost and not the investment cost
[160]. Moreover, the more the reliability of satisfying the stochastic
demand, the more the investment cost. Especially in IENs where the
electricity network is highly dependent on the gas system, increasing the
reliability of the gas system significantly increases the reliability of the
whole IEN [169]. Also, increase in the level of stress within the IEN
increases both the cost of operation and investment [184]. It was found
that N-1 contingency of natural gas transmission network has large
impact on planning of IENs, especially in the regions with limited nat-
ural gas resources [170]. Also, it was shown that installation of new
pipelines or incorporation of fuel switching capabilities are effective
solutions to relieve fuel supply constraints and reduce the total opera-
tional costs [191].
3.3.2.2.1. Co-planning. Co-planning of IENs has been compared
against sequential or separate planning in several papers and several
benefits in terms of above aspects around the energy trilemma have been
investigated. It was found that co-planning of IENs finds a solution with
the following characteristics compared to sequential or separate plan-
ning, due to the fact that it considers strategically all the networks and
their interactions:
lower total costs (investment and operational) [158,167,168,170,
171,174,179–183,186,188,190,193,197], or equivalently higher
social welfare [194–196]. Especially the higher load growth rates,
the higher benefit to cost ratios [167]. This is due to the fact that IEN
has an infrastructure capable of levelling the loads in different vec-
tors and hence it can relieve transmission stress and postpone con-
struction investment and operational costs [172,174].
lower carbon emissions [167,189].
less load curtailment [171,181].
higher robustness and reliability levels while accommodating
different uncertainties in the IEN [167,172,179,185,189,195,196].
Also, if operational constraints are neglected, e.g. power imbalance is
allowed, then the total cost decreases since certain investments can
be avoided [190].
more flexible [196] and enhanced resilience levels [186].
less transmission and energy losses [181,196] and hence higher ef-
ficiency of the energy grids and better infrastructure utilisation ef-
ficiency [162,181,189,195,196] due  to maximised transfer
capabilities within all the vectors [196].
3.3.2.2.2. Networks interactions. Natural Gas-fired Power Plants
(NGPPs) have been investigated more compared to other possible
coupling components for the operational planning of IENs in the liter-
ature. It was found that installation of NGPPs reduces investment [158]
as well as the total operational costs, since this guarantees security of the
electricity network [170] and NGPPs and system transmission capacity
are efficiently utilised [167] (despite the growth in operational costs of
the gas network due to building more infrastructure [192]). Also, it is
necessary to integrate more NGPPs to increase the reliability over the
planning horizon [159,179]. Additionally, the sensitivity of the inte-
grated networks design to the confidence level is dependent on the
quantised size of the candidate NGPPs and the level of the electricity
demand [179]. It was found that the constraints of transport of natural
gas has influence on the planning of the electricity system, especially in
regions where the candidate NGPPs depend massively on a constant
supply of natural gas [191].
4. Research needs, gaps and future research direction
recommendation
The systematic review has identified the following gaps for future
research in operation, dispatch and planning of multi-vector energy
networks.
4.1. Smart energy management framework
There is a need for development of advanced control and manage-
ment frameworks in order to perform online optimal dispatch of IENs
based on historical and online data that are further processed by Arti-
ficial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This
framework needs to be deployed through Internet of Things (IoT)
framework since there is a growing attraction in online acquisition and
storage of data in IoT frameworks. Additionally, energy networks are
becoming more integrated through several coupling components. As a
result of vector integration using ICT systems and data collection
through IoT frameworks, cyber attacks are considered as a potential
threat to the operation of multi-vector energy networks. Therefore, IoT-
driven control and management frameworks for IENs considering AI, ML
and cyber security assessment needs to be investigated and deployed on
multi-vector energy networks with a single owner for test and validation
purposes (Fig. 8). In this way, the studies that have been carried out on
security and resilience of future electricity grids [204] can be further
extended to future IENs.
4.2. Organisational and regulatory barriers for the future integrated
control rooms
The benefits of integrated optimal planning and dispatch of energy
networks have been investigated in several publications and have been
summarised in this paper. However, in reality these networks, which are
coupled at several locations, are planned and operated separate from
each other in transmission level all the way to medium level distribution
level since they are owned, operated and governed by different com-
panies/governments/regulators. As a consequence, if a fault/contin-
gency occurs in one of the networks, the operator of that network
attempts to find the solution within that network, whereas, the other
coupled network(s) might be able to provide some support/service to
relieve this affected network (Fig. 9). However, integrated control and
management of coupled networks in one central location has not yet
been investigated, due to the following facts: (i) each energy network
has its own control room separate from the control room of the other
coupled energy network(s); (ii) organisational policies, procedures and
regulation of each network operator is different from the other one. In
order to benefit from the advantages of integrated planning, dispatch
and control of coupled energy networks, the operators of the networks
need to be in one central location and communicate with each other in
order to find a practical solution for planning of the networks or for
fault/contingency relief in case of occurrence of any fault/contingency
in either network.
Hence, some relevant questions need to be considered in the phase of
designing the control rooms of future such as:
• How well do the tasks and roles in different control rooms
correspond?
• Are there different levels of urgency or extent of active intervention
needed?
• At what scale of production does gas-for-storage become significant
on either side?
• What regulatory, market or institutional factors might affect co-
operation?
• How could control room practices be adapted to enable new possi-
bilities for energy storage?
4.3. Impact of uncertainties on the trilemma evaluation of performance of
IENs
Impact of uncertainty of renewable generation and loads on the
energy trilemma have been investigated in several publications. How-
ever, uncertainties of the following have not yet been evaluated:
(i) The physical characteristics of the energy networks and coupling
components normally deteriorate over time. No models have yet
been developed to correlate the impact of aging of the physical
assets on deterioration of physical characteristics of the networks
and hence on the operation and energy trilemma;
(ii) Dynamic behaviour of the networks have been investigated in
several papers. However, ideal networks with perfect assump-
tions have always been considered for this purpose. These model
simplifications and perfect assumptions help a model to run and
produce results faster. However, this happens at the expense of
some uncertainty in the results based on which the operator of the
network wants to make the right decision at the right time.
To conclude, there is a need to evaluate the extent of impact of these
modelling uncertainties on the energy trilemma performance evaluation
of IENs to obtain a tolerance range when reporting the performance of
IENs. This especially applies to high level integrated networks such as
transmission or high level distribution networks, where great amounts
of energy carriers are transmitted over long distances and even minor
miscalculations can have great consequences on the energy trilemma
performance evaluation of IENs (Fig. 10).
4.4. Economics of energy system integration
Several technical benefits around the elements of energy trilemma
have been investigated for integrated operational analysis of coupled
networks by different researchers, which have been summarised in this
paper. However, networks operate under the constraints of market,
regulatory, and policy frameworks through price signals, taxes, and
other incentives [205]. The more integration of the networks, the more
complexity is introduced in the linkages between the operators of the
coupled networks. There is, therefore, a need to investigate which level
(i.e., transmission or distribution) and to what extent is best to have
more integration in the networks in order to better resolve the energy
trilemma challenges and to explore whether the economic network
integration benefits can be improved through amendments to market,
regulatory and policy constraints. If one of the levels was found as the
best level to have more integration, then what would be the added value
of integration of operation in the other level in terms of the marginal
benefits for the whole energy system.
4.5. Deployment of smart multi-energy regions
With increasing linkages between gas, electricity and district heating
networks, deployment of smart multi-energy in regions rather than
districts is gaining attention in the energy research community [10,
105]. The very first challenging step to deploy these regions is devel-
opment of models for optimal planning , dispatch and operational
analysis of these regions. However, there are several challenges associ-
ated with this step, which need further investigation and are summar-
ised as follows:
(i) Developing dynamics of the gas and district heating networks [4];
(ii) Convergence and optimality of the solutions of the models
without compensation for accuracy [4];
(iii) TEE impact of renewable energy generation at the building level,
e.g. PV and solar thermal, on the IENs [28];
(iv) Development of control strategies that can be used for close-to
real-time simulation [28];
(v) TEE impact analysis of the flexibility offered by P2G on operation
of the IENs [22,57];
(vi) Forecasting the demand (heat and electricity) and optimum uti-
lisation of the flexibility of the multi-energy system [13];
(vii) Quantification and evaluation of the TEE impact of natural di-
sasters on the resilience of the smart multi-energy IENs [18]; and
(viii) TEE evaluation of benefits of seasonal storage and the impact on
the IENs while transporting the gas produced by P2G to the
seasonal storage facilities [10].
5. Conclusions
This paper summarises the most important findings of recent litera-
ture on analysis of multi-vector energy networks, rather than energy
hubs, in relation to the elements of energy trilemma: flexibility of oper-
ation, security of supply and affordability. The reviewed papers have been
classified into three groups: (i) Operational analysis; (ii) Optimal
dispatch; and (iii) Optimal planning. The focus of this paper has been on
energy networks since the main parts of the whole energy system that
connect the natural resources and import to the final energy user are
energy networks including gas, electricity and district heating/cooling
networks along with the couplings and interactions that occur between
them both at transmission and distribution levels. Also, the focus of this
paper has been on key findings rather than the energy models since the
models developed for simulation and analysis of Integrated Energy
Networks (IENs) have been reviewed in several other literature. The key
findings of the most recent papers have been explained in relation to the
elements of energy trilemma. The main driver for this paper was to
identify the gaps in the state of the art in the area of multi-vector energy
networks research and to articulate this through the lens of the energy
trilemma.
The paper makes recommendations for future research priorities
including: development and demonstration of cyber resilient smart en-
ergy management frameworks, ways to overcome organisational and
regulatory barriers for future increased energy network integration,
uncertainty analysis of the future performance of IENs, potential eco-
nomic value of energy systems integration and deployment of smart
multi-energy regions.
The paper provides useful insights for the energy research commu-
nity by presenting several novel ideas for future research and facilitating
the path to a decarbonised economy, due to the comprehensive sys-
tematic review that has been carried out.

ABSTRACT
Within the context of the Smart City, the need for intelligent approaches to manage and coordinate the diverse
range of supply and conversion technologies and demand applications has been well established. The wide-scale
proliferation of sensors coupled with the implementation of embedded computational intelligence algorithms
can help to tackle many of the technical challenges associated with this energy systems integration problem.
Nonetheless, barriers still exist, as suitable methods are needed to handle complex networks of actors, often with
competing objectives, while determining design and operational decisions for systems across a wide spectrum of
features and time-scales. This review looks at the current developments in the smart energy sector, focussing on
techniques in the main application areas along with relevant implemented examples, while highlighting some of
the key challenges currently faced and outlining future pathways for the sector. A detailed overview of a fra-
mework developed for the EU H2020 funded Sharing Cities project is also provided to illustrate the nature of the
design stages encountered and control hierarchies required. The study aims to summarise the current state of
computational intelligence in the field of smart energy management, providing insight into the ways in which
current barriers can be overcome.
1. Introduction
Although cities occupy only 3% of the earth’s land area, they con-
sume 75% of natural resources and produce 60–80% of global green-
house gas emissions [1]. Their impact on the environment will grow as
urbanization increases from 54% of the world population today to 66%
by 2050 [2]. Increasing resource efficiency at city scale would enable a
more environmentally sustainable solution and help to transition to a
low carbon economy while meeting the challenges of increasing po-
pulation in such areas. Multiple UN, EU and US projects have been
developed in the recent past which are targeted towards solutions for
such sustainable cities. These include the GI-REC (Global Initiative for
Resource Efficient Cities) [1] by the United Nations, European In-
novation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC) [3]
by the European Union and the Smart Cities Initiative [4] by the United
States among others.
Reliable, efficient and low carbon energy supply is one of the key
requirements for next generation smart cities [5]. The close proximity
of multiple energy vectors like electric power, heat and gas, introduces
opportunities for energy systems integration and real time management
of multiple energy vectors [6]. The vision for the future smart energy
system is to have automated algorithms which are able to learn user
demand and usage profiles from historical data [7], leverage on that
information to optimise, coordinate and control the interconversion
and distribution of different energy vectors, while simultaneously
taking into account the engineering constraints of the system and the
business and policy objectives. As embedded algorithms become more
pervasive at different levels of the energy network (from smart meters
[8] at the usage end of customers to real-time phasor measurement
units along the transmission lines), Computational Intelligence (CI) and
Machine Learning (ML) would become increasingly important to take
automated decisions and react to changes in system dynamics [9].
This review seeks first to provide an overview of many of the main
areas in which CI and ML strategies are currently implemented in smart
energy systems. By the nature of the topic, application areas are di-
verse, however, the push towards system integration necessitates a
holistic perspective. Firstly, data management challenges are in-
troduced, followed by applications specific to the built environment
and transport sectors. The integration of different supplies and demands
is then covered, with an additional section devoted to the user’s role in
this technological landscape. After this review of current application
areas, the focus shifts in Section 3 towards the future potential of CI and
ML in the smart energy domain, targeting key challenges that can be
overcome through the further implementation of current techniques. It
also highlights the challenges and short-comings of the present CI/ML
tools and presents potential future developments in these fields that
would be beneficial in the context of smart energy systems. In Section 4,
implementation considerations are addressed, leading to a specific case
study in Section 5 in which many of the key smart energy aspects are
present. The project, an EU Horizon 2020 Smart City project (called
Sharing Cities) is one the authors are working, which incorporates
multi-vector energy systems and integration of different energy assets,
encountering the associated challenges in real time demonstration of
the same.
2. Review of existing concepts and applications in smart energy
management systems
Intelligent solutions for control and operation of the various in-
dividual components that comprise an urban energy system have be-
come increasingly prevalent [10]. Often driven by the goals of reducing
energy consumption, emissions or cost [11], while maintaining ro-
bustness to uncertainty [12], such approaches seek to leverage the key
enablers of increased computational power and data ubiquity, as well as
artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and advanced control
techniques [12]. These approaches need not be solely characterised as
‘Smart City’ related interventions and are often considered in an iso-
lated manner. Nonetheless, the overlapping objectives, challenges and
enablers mean that the application of computational intelligence to the
challenge of Smart Cities must consider the amalgamation, adaptation
and integration of these various solutions.
In this section, some such approaches are summarised, particularly
focussing on the building and transport sectors as energy demands,
followed by methods for integrating the disparate sources and sinks.
2.1. Urban data handling
The definitions of Smart Cities are varied, with examples to be found
in [13]. Though a large number of themes and concepts arise under the
Smart City umbrella, a central and common aspect across almost all
solutions and domains is the incorporation of Information and Com-
munications Technology (ICT) [14] and the Internet of Things (IoT)
[15].
2.1.1. Big data & the internet of things
Across all domains, Cisco have estimated that 50 billion devices will
be connected to the IoT by 2020 [16]. As more objects are connected to
the IoT, the ability to exploit an ever-expanding volume of data, now
given the moniker Big Data, has been a key driver behind many new
approaches [17]. Developments in the management, utilisation and
analysis of such large data-sets have emerged to facilitate this, with a
shift away from relational database technologies to distributed Not
Only SQL (NoSQL) database technologies such as Cassandra and Mon-
goDB due to increased flexibility and scalability [18]. Many works
evaluate the characteristics of big data management in terms of the Vs
of data management, which can include [19] Volume, Variety, Velocity,
Variability and Value. Others have been referred to, including Veracity,
Volatility and Validity [20]. A particular challenge in this regard is in
the use of soft-sensing approaches, whereby data from sensors not as-
sociated with specific pre-defined tasks (e.g. data from mobile devices)
is harnessed. In [14], these challenges are explored, with particular
attention paid to the veracity, volume and velocity of data. ML and
probability based approaches for data fusion [21] can improve things,
exploiting the commonalities across multiple data sources.
Without appropriate strategies, wastefulness is inevitable. With this
in mind, inefficiencies resulting from improperly managed data is
covered in [11]. Capturing the data while avoiding inefficiencies re-
quires appropriate platforms to be developed with the power to process
and integrate a large number of data streams from different sources,
potentially with varying time-scales and data formats, while also pro-
viding the necessary APIs and storage capability. A generic architecture
incorporating layers for sensing, transmission, data management and
specific applications is proposed in [22], while, more generally, the
protocols and architectures suitable for such an application of IoT in a
Smart City context are surveyed in [23].
Targeting applications for this data processing capability, a detailed
overview of the energy saving opportunities of using ICT as an enabling
technology is provided in [24] in which a framework is developed to
identify opportunity hotspots for applying ICT to reduce energy use. The
authors conclude, in agreement with a study in [25], that the installa-
tion of intelligent heating systems and the use of ICT for production
process control and supply chain management are areas of particular
potential. The availability of data coupled with CI and ambient in-
telligence techniques can allow for more accurate forecasts of future
loads [26] which is especially useful in the domain of energy systems.
These can be used to aid in the selection of suitable operational ap-
proaches and control decisions, automation and visualisation. A review
of the main CI approaches for this purpose is provided in [27]. The
accuracy of hybrid approaches (whereby multiple techniques are
combined) are shown in particular to outperform standalone ap-
proaches in terms of load forecast accuracy.
The suitability of any specific method, however, depends on the
target data-set. Inevitably, reliance on data in complex networks of
systems can introduce large uncertainties - the importance of which
should not be underestimated. Effective methods for characterising this
uncertainty are needed to handle this issue, with a review of possible
approaches suitable to the integrated energy domain presented in [28].
The authors allude to the common over-reliance on non-empirical as-
sumptions in many approaches as well as the often underestimated
need to consider the interrelation of uncertainties across multiple
parameters. Furthermore, apart from parametric uncertainty, effective
exploitation of data in an energy management scheme requires the data
quality to be suitable for the task-at-hand, with adequate excitation,
granularity and trustworthiness.
2.1.2. Communication networks
The vast increase in sensors and the need for interconnectivity be-
tween networks of sensors and actuators has lead to an evolution in the
communication infrastructure used for the implementation of smart
grids. The traditional state of the power grid is summarised in [29] as a
one-way pipeline with clear demarcations between generation, trans-
mission and transformation, where system capacities are often sized for
worst case scenarios, due to an inability to incorporate DSM. The smart
grid alternative however, as discussed in [30], can instead be viewed as
hierarchy of three newtworks: the Home Area Network (HAN), the
Neighbourhood Area Network (NAN) and the Wide Area Network
(WAN). The HAN layer typically operates wirelessly over small areas,
useful for sensors and smart meters in buildings, where low date rate
technologies (following Zigbee or Z-wave standards for example) are
well suited due to security, low cost and low power requirement. For
NAN, spanning groups of buildings or districts in an urban environ-
ment, Wi-Fi and cellular technologies can be employed. Ethernet net-
works can be well suited to the WAN layer due to the higher data rate
requirements. Suitable protocols and standards for implementation of
these networks are crucial however, with different companies and
countries approaching the problem separately. Common standards from
organisations such as the Institute for Electrical and Electronics En-
gineers (IEEE) (e.g. IEEE P2030) have been developed to counteract
this.
2.1.3. Cyber-security
The reliance of the smart city on communication networks and
connectivity inevitably leads to significant cyber-security concerns with
adversarial threats and an increased risk of system misuse (externally or
internally) impacting a large number of people. The increased digital
surface in a smart city, as referred to in [31], results in more opportu-
nities for security breaches. The interrelations between different net-
works can also introduce the possibility of cascade failures and fault
propagation. Furthermore, in the energy domain, traditional systems
are often incorporated within the wider smart city environment, but
may provide inadequate security protocols. Security issues in Super-
visory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems commonly used
to manage energy systems are detailed in [32] for example. A com-
prehensive summary of the different threats faced across different smart
city sectors is provided in [33], including malicious threats and in-
secure protocols in smart-grids, home automation systems and cloud
storage. The authors also focus on the forensic data requirements to
effectively investigate incidents protect against future incidents.
The volume of data and the vast number of connected devices can
make effective mitigation of these issues a serious challenge. In [34] for
example, the difficulty of cryptographic key management for smart
meters is highlighted in a scenario in which keys are updated periodi-
cally - an unprecedented need for support staff and time results. To
understand the threats faced and assess vulnerability, threat modelling
approaches are developed in [35]. This modelling and assessment is
generalised further in [36] where the concept of the Safe City is dis-
cussed, whereby, the effectiveness of safety and healthcare processes
are improved. In [37], security solutions are discussed for smart grids,
once again highlighting the need for adaptive key management solu-
tions in smart meters such as the privacy preserving aggregation
scheme with adaptive key management (PARK) proposed in [38].
2.2. The built environment
The prominence of buildings as significant energy consumers in the
global energy landscape is well understood, with 40% of global energy
consumption typically assigned to the general building sector [39].
Despite including complex heating, cooling and electrical demands,
traditional rule-based approaches for managing relevant components
and determining operational decisions dominate, leading to un-
necessary inefficiencies [40]. In anticipation of the future dec-
arbonisation of the electricity grid, a desire to move towards electricity-
based heat sources (primarily through heat pumps) has emerged in
recent times [41], furthering the case for integrated energy approaches
[42]. Additionally, more efficient data handling through suitable
Building Information Modelling (BIM) methods introduces opportunity
for change [43], with the possibility for improved monitoring and di-
agnostic techniques, such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) al-
gorithms developed in [44]. Through the use of intelligent modelling
and control techniques, enabled by the increased access to measured
data from the buildings and external environment, significant reduc-
tions in energy consumption have been reported in [45], with potential
savings of approximately 30% achieved through automation. Some of
the more common approaches proposed for achieving these savings are
presented here, with comprehensive reviews available in [46,45].
2.2.1. Demand-side management in smart cities
The term Demand Side Management (DSM) can be used to represent
a wide range of interventions in the built environment, from permanent
actions (e.g. retrofit) to short-timescale actions like Demand Response
(DR) [47]. Smart city concepts and intelligent control can have a par-
ticularly significant impact on the shorter-timescale events, with real-
time data providing the basis for automated decisions. Key to the
suitability of the built environment for this is the flexible nature of the
demand. The slow thermal dynamics and imprecise nature of the
thermal objectives in buildings (occupants typically require ambient
temperatures to be within a band, rather than matching a specific single
set-point) introduces the opportunity for wider system optimisation.
Without diminishing comfort in the building, loads can be temporally
shifted [48,49], allowing (with appropriate control) for the satisfaction
of supply constraints and an improvement in the performance of the
overall energy system. A multi-objective optimisation approach to do
just this is introduced in [50] for example.
Furthermore, with an increased push for the electrification of heat
[51] and district heating networks [52], coupled with the relative
cheapness of thermal storage [53], the link between building thermal
loads and the wider energy system becomes stronger. As such, the
ability to coordinate and aggregate demand-side thermal loads in an
urban environment underpins much of the potential benefits of energy
system integration [46] (discussed further in Section 2.4).
2.2.2. Advanced control strategies
For thermal management, advanced control approaches such as
Model Predictive Control (MPC) have been regularly reported in lit-
erature to provide improved heating and cooling system control over
more traditional strategies [45]. In such approaches, the operation of
the system (typically Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems
(HVAC)) is optimised over a receding horizon using predictive dynamic
models, often to minimise energy consumption subject to comfort
constraints. Many variations have been proposed, such as a prioritised-
objective approach in [54] to avoid the need for excessive tuning
parameter selection and the stochastic approach of [55], formulated to
better incorporate uncertainty.
Aside from MPC, other non-traditional approaches can be ad-
vantageous. Fuzzy-logic controllers (FLCs) are proposed in [56,57] to
achieve an improved performance with less of a design burden when
compared to MPC. To incorporate user-behaviour in the automated
decision process, a multi-agent based approach is proposed in [58] to
handle the control of the different regions of a multi-zone building, with
a further incorporation of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) in [59]
and reinforcement learning in [60]. A more detailed review of such
approaches can be found in [61]. While performance benefits of more
advanced approaches are clear, the initial cost and expertise require-
ment is as yet prohibitive [62]. Within a wider smart city context
however, in which data platforms and sensor networks become more
commonplace, such approaches should become more attractive.
On the electrical side, load shifting through appropriate control of
heat-pumps and thermal storage is discussed in [49]. Such load shifting
approaches can reduce required installed capacity as well as reducing
stress on the wider system though monetising, incentivising and fairly
distributing the financial gains from this wider system operational
benefit is an open challenge. In [63], the impact of such DSM strategies
on comfort levels is assessed, particularly noting the importance of the
building fabric properties on the load-shifting potential - a better in-
sulated building has a greater potential to store energy in the building
fabric. Looking at the wider system behaviour, DR strategies can be
implemented for active and reactive power balance [64], frequency
regulation [65] and power factor correction [66]. Appropriate me-
chanisms for achieving these aims have been proposed [67], with
success reliant on appropriate pricing models which must achieve
system flexibility with appropriate compensation for the providers of
this flexibility, without compromising clarity and transparency. In [68],
many of the current pricing scheme options are summarised.
2.2.3. Modelling the thermal behaviour of buildings
Supporting many of these proposed control strategies is the ability
to utilise data to develop more accurate models of the thermal and
electrical behaviour of the buildings [69]. An ANN-based approach
proposed in [70] is shown to be effective for forecasting electricity
consumption, while in [71], a Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach is
similarly applied. Black-box system identification approaches (such as
the Auto-Regressive Moving Average model with Exogenous input
(ARMAX)-type approach) are covered in [72,73], whereby standard
linear relationships between the heat inputs and resulting temperatures
are assumed. The resulting model formulations are suitable for ad-
vanced control, while accuracy over the relevant time horizons can be
achieved, but only with sufficiently excited training data [74]. To
capture the behaviour and interactions of users with the energy systems
and thus better predict energy demands, agent-based approaches can be
implemented, such as in [75]. Time-series approaches for forecasting
building energy consumption are reviewed in [76], while electrical load
forecasting techniques reviewed in [77].
Appropriate methodological choices are case-specific. Black-box
approaches can reduce the need for deep knowledge of the underlying
system to be incorporated a priori, however, many design choices (such
as system order and structure) are still required. While any of the above
approaches can be integrated into a smart energy management strategy,
success is very much predicated on sufficient data quality. This requires
a good degree of excitation and a low-level of unmeasured disturbance -
as highlighted in [40]. Hybrid approaches that can blend expert
knowledge with empirical data effectively are an attractive prospect.
Gray-box [78] and white-box approaches, in which an underlying
physics-based model structure is assumed, can increase the likelihood
of sensible outcomes, though the incorporation of this information can
become intractable as system scale and complexity increases.
Data availability and quality as well as system complexity are key
considerations in the selection of a suitable approach. In cases where
very little data is available (even coarse consumption data, though
measured, may not be accessible due to privacy concerns), it can still be
possible to characterise the energy performance of a building. This may
be insufficient for advanced control, however it can still be useful to
inform decisions surrounding future interventions and to understand if
energy consumption is following expected patterns. A benchmarking
approach for information poor buildings is provided in [79] to identify
deviations from monthly energy bill data with some additional HVAC
measurements. In scenarios of little historical data it can also be pos-
sible to exploit the fact that vast quantities of data may be available for
similar buildings which may display similar dynamics. A transfer
learning method for energy prediction is proposed in [80] for example,
using time-series multi-feature regression with an allowance for sea-
sonal and trend adjustments. In [81], a Deep Belief Network (DBN) (for
feature extraction) is incorporated into a reinforcement learning-based
approach to enable knowledge transfer to buildings without historical
data. Apart from lacking in historical data, there may also be gaps and
missing values potentially affecting predictive performance. This is
acknowledged in [82] in which the authors build an interpolation
scheme into a wider approach for building energy prediction using deep
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). This is a less researched area and
more focus needs to be given to developing modelling methodologies
addressing these issues.
2.2.4. Fault detection and diagnosis
As data-driven techniques can be used for prediction of system be-
haviour, it follows that similar techniques can be employed to detect
when the energy systems (e.g. HVAC) behave in a manner deviating
from expected operational bounds in times of component fault or
failure. Many techniques for Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) have
been studied, with approaches classified in [83] as process-history
based (models inferred from measured data), quantitative model based
(detailed physical models), and qualitative model-based (expert-de-
signed rules). When detailed models are not available, grey-box or
black-bock approaches can be attractive. A wide variety of statistical
and ML techniques have been explored for such data-driven strategies
with popular approaches including Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) [84] to detect anomalous divergence between interrelated vari-
ables, ANNs and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [85,86] to classify
faults based trained on historical data and fuzzy logic [87] to more
easily incorporate human knowledge in the classification procedure. A
detailed summary of the main approaches can be found in [88].
Though new opportunities have emerged with more pervasive
sensing, historical data tends to be lacking in data describing critical
events or attacks [89]. If a wide range of failure modes are possible,
corresponding training data may be difficult or impossible to obtain in
sufficient quantity. To allow for this, suitable probabilistic approaches
must be considered. A probabilistic neural network method was shown
in [90] to out-perform more standard back-propagated neural networks
for fault detection in refrigeration systems for example. Parameter-in-
variant approaches have been developed for classification in which
constant false positive rates are obtained regardless of parameter values
[89]. These approaches have been taken in networked systems [91] and
for HVAC systems in the building energy domain [92]. Hybrid ap-
proaches which can combine the benefits of physical knowledge, expert
knowledge and historical data can be harnessed to better tackle the
complexity present in a multi-tiered set of urban energy networks [88].
The ability of Bayesian approaches to incorporate subjective informa-
tion enable them to fit easily in a hybrid framework. The benefits of
hybrid approaches have been long understood (a grey-box approach
that incorporates physical knowledge with Bayesian techniques is
proposed for example in [93]), however such approaches come with a
significant design burden and off-the-shelf solutions may not match the
specific need.
2.2.5. Zero-energy and nearly-zero-energy buildings
As reported in [94], Zero-Energy-Buildings (ZEBs) and Near-Zero-
Energy-Buildings (NZEBs) are expected to play a significant role in
achieving the goals of the European “Smart Cities & Communities In-
itiative” [95]. Conceptually, ZEBs should meet all their energy re-
quirements from nonpolluting renewable sources, however, specific
definitions vary in strictness [96], typically depending on the allowance
of off-site renewable generation. The slightly less stringent concept of
NZEBs has become more common, though inconsistencies in definition
are present across different countries [97]. Nonetheless, the concept fits
in with other smart energy approaches, as intelligent coordination is
required to maximise the utilisation of any renewable energy sources
through management of the supply and demand. Any successful NZEB
will tend to require a mix of energy generation and storage technologies
which must be optimally managed. From an operational perspective,
advanced control approaches and optimised scheduling play a sig-
nificant role [98]. In [99] for example, a model is developed to handle
the stochastic nature of renewable generation while minimising costs
through optimised scheduling based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs),
teaching learning-based optimisation (TLBO) and enhanced differential
evolution (EDE). In [100] game theoretic approaches and adaptive
fuzzy control strategies are used to manage the demand and supply
respectively.
From a design perspective, CI and ML approaches can also be le-
veraged to approach zero energy. In [101], the need for suitable
optimisation approaches for evaluating different design options is un-
derlined (including geometry, fabric construction, ventilation strategies
and shading, as well as energy system design). Evolutionary algorithms
are put forward by the authors as an attractive option. Technology
selection is also crucial. In [102] for example, Monte Carlo simulations
are used to evaluate hybrid energy system solutions.
2.3. Transportation energy and mobility
The potential impact of CI in the transport sector has been well
reported, often from an infrastructural perspective, with solutions di-
rected towards challenges such as congestion management [103] and
space utilisation (e.g. parking) [10]. The energy perspective must also
be considered.
2.3.1. Electrification of the sector
As with the heating sector, the anticipated de-carbonisation of the
power grid coupled with technological advances in the electric-vehicle
(EV) sector [104] has led to EVs becoming a lower carbon option for
personal transport than traditional fossil fuel-based approaches [105].
Furthermore, e-bike and e-scooter rental schemes may become more
common in the coming years [106]. This is all likely to lead to increased
stress on the electricity grid at times of peak load [107], necessitating
the introduction of more intelligent energy management strategies. In
[108], the potential to use different CI-based algorithms (including PSO
and Genetic Algorithms) to achieve this is explored. As with any opti-
mised approach, suitable definition of the objective or fitness function
is crucial to achieve a behaviour that suits all involved actors. Apart
from stressing the grid, on a positive note, EVs can allow for increased
grid flexibility, particularly if Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power flow is
permitted. Estimation of the flexibility introduced through EVs using
agent-based modelling techniques is discussed in [109]. Once again, the
need to incentivise and appropriately monetise V2G type power flow,
considering the longterm impact on the EV batteries (in [110] it is re-
ported that in an extreme case of full daily battery discharge results in a
3.2–4.4 year reduction in battery life if used for V2G) is a challenge.
Aside from V2G, to achieve flexibility, a variable Time-of-Use (ToU)
cost for charging electric vehicles is proposed in [105]. The purpose is
to optimise the ToU in such a manner as to discourage EV charging at
times of high grid-stress to better manage the overall grid load. To
enable the use of renewable sources with the high loads of fast-charge
EV stations in an off-grid fashion, a decentralised control formulation
integrating renewables, storage and fast-chargers is developed in [111].
Further to this, to manage the introduction of EV charging to a smart-
grid context while handling the uncertainties of renewable generation
and the associated system constraints, a hierarchical MPC approach is
proposed in [112]. For any such scheme, the challenge of predicting
short-term EV demand profiles is key to success. Markov-chain traffic
models are proposed to achieve this in [113] using real-time CCTV data.
Using public vehicle fleets with pre-specified schedules (such as buses
[114] and waste disposal fleets) could greatly simplify the problem of
predictable coordination.
2.3.2. Fuel diversification
Apart from EVs, the ability to integrate different energy supplies can
enable alternative fuel sources to be incorporated more easily into the
transport sector. In [115] for example, ethanol produced for transport
in a multi-energy system is discussed, with a decrease in transportation
costs of 30% projected [116]. Similarly, the use of fuel-cells for EVs as
energy generators and distributors (whereby hydrogen acts as the en-
ergy carrier) to encourage the transition to 100% renewable energy is
outlined in [117] with a control methodology for such a scheme out-
lined in [118]. More generally, this concept of integrating different
energy sources while simultaneously aggregating, shifting and mana-
ging energy demands is central to the topic of smart energy manage-
ment systems and is discussed further in Section 2.4.
2.4. Integrated systems
The high population density and correspondingly large demands
across the different energy vectors found in urban environments leads
to opportunities for more efficient operation by combining and con-
verting supplies and temporally redistributing demands through energy
storage and intelligent control [119]. Renewable energy sources can
have significant environmental benefits, with technological improve-
ments and reducing costs (in [120] for example, a drop in installed cost
of up to 50% was recorded for solar energy between 2010 and 2015
alone) ensuring that they will play a crucial role in the urban energy
landscape. Through appropriate energy management, an increased pe-
netration of renewable and low-carbon sources can be achieved, as well
as a more efficient consumption of generated power, heating and
cooling [116].
2.4.1. Distributed generation
Smart meters can provide a high degree of granularity for mea-
surement and control of spatially distributed actors [121]. This, along
with distributed ledger technologies [122] introduces the potential to
include a wider array of energy producers in the energy system, leading
to concepts in which domestic buildings and data-centres can be seen as
prosumers [123], generating heat and/or power. This changes the urban
energy sector from a set of centralised supplies and decentralised de-
mands to an interconnected set of distributed supply and demand net-
works. The central part to be played by IoT in the future development of
these interconnected systems and smart grids is emphasised in [124].
Based on a Malaga use-case, [125] highlights the importance of voltage
regulation strategies with a large renewable penetration. This is an area
where demand response [126] and coordination [65] can play a sig-
nificant role.
A further benefit to this increasingly diverse, distributed approach is
system resilience [127], which is a critical concern in an energy dense
urban environment with limited space. The definition of resilience,
once again, tends to vary, but it can generally be seen as the ability of a
system to survive a shock and return to equilibrium [128]. In a system
reliant on a single centralised energy source, a single shock or un-
expected change can have a significant system-wide impact when
compared with a smart integrated system with multiple sources. Some
of the key factors influencing energy system resilience are highlighted
in [127], including spatial distribution of generation, collocation of
supply and demand, diversification of fuel mix and generation type,
back-up energy stocks, storage and spare generation capacity. Dis-
tributed generation capacity is insufficient without suitable distributed
energy trading mechanisms however, such as the approach for trading
between multiple islanded micro-grids in [129]. A cooperative energy
trading scheme is developed in [130] in which the two way trade be-
tween local renewable generation and the grid is optimised to minimise
the total energy cost subject to quality of service constraints. In con-
trast, the problem is considered in the form of non-cooperative actors in
[131], whereby a game theoretic framework is applied to the problem.
2.4.2. Multi-vector generation
The close proximity of electrical, heating and cooling demands can
make the city environment particularly suitable to co-generation and
tri-generation technologies, utilising heat that would otherwise have
been wasted [119]. As previously mentioned, the continued de-carbo-
nisation of the electrical grid has brought increased attention to heat
pump technologies. Furthermore a push towards renewable technolo-
gies such as biomass and solar [132] for both heating and cooling has
resulted in a changing energy landscape. To incorporate different sup-
plies, emphasising the lower carbon options, storage technologies and
district energy networks can be implemented as discussed in
[133–135]. In [136], the introduction of a hydrogen grid to integrate
with electrical and thermal networks is discussed. This could in turn
promote the increased adoption of fuel cells for energy storage.
Appropriate selection of technologies and designs is needed here, with
data science and modelling techniques once again playing an important
role. Concepts and evaluation models for such Multi-Energy Systems
(MES) are reviewed in [116], with methodologies incorporating Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques developed in [137],
further incorporating evolutionary techniques in [138].
The move towards distributed generation facilitates a greater range
of technology options. Given the spatial constraints of an urban en-
vironment, wind energy potential may be limited, however the use of
small turbines is not uncommon [15]. Similarly, solar energy uptake
has increased rapidly in recent years [120]. The need for adequate
storage levels to enable temporal shifting of variable renewable sup-
plies to match demands is key. Many storage technologies exist, with
time-scales ranging from milliseconds to seasons [139]. Some less
conventional options include mechanical flywheels (as reviewed in
[140]) and supercapacitors [141], while in thermal networks phase
change materials have a much higher energy density than water (as
they exploit latent energy storage) [53]. Battery technology has ad-
vanced in recent years with lithium-ion batteries comparing favourably
in terms of lifespan, energy density and power with more traditional
lead-acid batteries [142]. The mix of electrical supplies alone can then
include baseloads (large-scale nuclear and fossil fuel-based generation),
co-generation plants, small scale diesel generators, solar PV, wind
power, run-of-river hydro [143], biofuels, fuel cells and any of the other
electrical storage options mentioned above. On top of this, the in-
creasingly common interconnections with the thermal and transport
networks must also be considered. Numerous possible combinations
and supply mixes can be chosen from (see for example the flywheel -
wind turbine - diesel generator approach of [144] or the integration of
renewables and nuclear in [145]). As such, design and operation stra-
tegies that can handle this new level of complexity, while delivering on
environmental, financial and resilience goals must be established [146].
2.4.3. Coordination, control and operation
Beyond design and analysis, operating distributed and multi-vector
energy systems in real-time with optimal decision making requires in-
novative control structures and software architectures. The energy hub
concept [147] has emerged with the intention of explicitly accounting
for the couplings between the different infrastructures. Decentralised
energy system integration through this concept is discussed in [148],
with case studies illustrating the benefits of suitable integration ap-
proaches (e.g. a combination of Photo-voltaic (PV), Solar thermal and
hydro produced 46% lower emissions than a PV-biomass combination).
Modelling and optimisation considerations are covered in [149], in
which economic benefits of 11%–29% and 11% emissions reductions
are predicted with optimised operation of a network of three energy
hubs.
From a control perspective, as with building energy, micro-grids and
smart-grids can benefit from the application of MPC due to an ability to
explicitly handle system constraints while incorporating predictions
and forecasts of system outputs and environmental variables that can
all impact the optimal decision making process [35]. The application of
MPC to MES is carried out in [150] with a particular focus on the choice
of suitable prediction horizon. In [151], active demand response ap-
proaches in electric heating systems coupled with storage for achieving
these impacts are introduced, with the authors presenting modelling
approaches which attempt to reduce computational effort without
losing validity. With such advanced strategies, the need to manage the
different actors and their respective objectives makes game theoretic
frameworks a natural fit. Such approaches are discussed in [152,153],
with the application to energy hubs illustrated in [154].
2.4.4. Interaction with the wider environment
The smart city concept can be seen as the application of ICT to all
aspects of urban life [155], far beyond energy. Energy networks will
tend to interact with and impact other aspects of the urban landscape,
most notably with water [156] and waste management [157]. These
interactions can be exploited for their potential synergies, with the
water-energy nexus being a prime example [158]. The high population
density and correspondingly high water demand in a city mean that
water systems must be carefully designed to ensure security of supply
(reflecting the challenges of the energy sector). Strategies that can re-
duce water demand can also reduce energy consumption. In [159],
rainwater harvesting and gray-water reuse is studied to this end. Such
advances will benefit from intelligent approaches [160] and increased
data acquisition [161]. Waste-water treatment must also be considered
here, particularly given the push towards resource recovery in the
sector [162] (fuel diversity can be improved through on-site generation
of biogas for example [163]). The design and analysis of the benefits of
such multi-domain schemes requires techniques that can handle the
system complexity [164], such as the network perspective proposed in
[165]. Additionally, full life-cycle assessments should be carried out to
understand the impacts of any interventions across all environmental
vectors. This involves consideration of the materials used, supply
chains, operation, waste and emissions from any intervention, such as
that carried out for EVs in [166].
2.5. User-centric considerations
As noted in [31], the success of a smart city depends on the parti-
cipation of its citizens. Intelligent solutions may often correspond to
increased automation, while many interventions seeking to improve
environmental and economic goals on a system-wide perspective may
not necessarily benefit all users within the system. Given the reliance of
a smart city on user engagement however, the human perspective must
be considered in any actions taken.
2.5.1. Participation and engagement
User participation can be passive or active. Data can be passively
gathered from users by soft-sensing or crowd-sensing [167] (using
sensors in phones for example) to understand the patterns of movement
around a city. Clearly, all citizens may not desire such a use of personal
data. To encourage active engagement, a ‘Smart Citizen’ app is pro-
posed in [168], enabling a smart city to take advantage of distributed
soft-sensing. Another platform has been developed in [167] to select
individual participants that can be best combined for effective crowd-
sensing. To incorporate users more directly in the operational decisions
of the city, control schemes can be formulated to accept feedback from
people, particularly useful for subjective measures (e.g. thermal com-
fort). Such a scheme is proposed for building energy in [169]. Inter-
active dashboards can be implemented to further encourage participa-
tion, displaying key metrics and statistics associated with the city’s
energy systems [170]. Users are central to any strategy [171] and as
such, all approaches must be carefully developed to ensure that users
supplying data and partaking in smart energy initiatives (e.g. prosu-
mers) are appropriately compensated, particularly given the potentially
conflicting objectives of energy suppliers. The topic of a smart city
energy marketplace is well explored in [172], considering the per-
spectives of the energy retailer, the distribution system operator, re-
sidential and commercial prosumers, market operator and service
providers. Full participation cannot be assumed however, and scenarios
in which access to user data is not permitted must still be considered,
such as energy meter data at an individual dwelling level or electric
vehicle usage. ML techniques such as transfer learning [173] can exploit
previously-acquired knowledge from similar problems (e.g. accessible
data from similar users) to estimate such data gaps.
2.5.2. Privacy concerns in data-rich landscapes
Given the data-driven nature of the smart city concept, user privacy
considerations must be prioritised in any form of participation. Changes
and improvements beyond the smart city domain such as the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have recently brought
these concerns to the fore, however, a greater understanding of the
challenge faced is needed to attain the benefits of interconnectivity
without infringing on peoples rights or misusing their trust. In [174] for
example, the importance of understanding the data types (personal or
impersonal) and the purpose for which they are collected (e.g. service
provision is more favourable than surveillance) to the perception of
privacy violation is underlined. To that end, the authors developed a
framework to better capture peoples privacy concerns by incorporating
such classifications. The problem of data over-collection is discussed in
[175], with the authors highlighting the difficulty of the problem as the
data collection can be within the permissions authorised by the user yet
can increase security risks. Active approaches for mitigating the pro-
blem are also introduced. Approaches for maintaining privacy in energy
trading schemes is considered in [176], specifically using multi-sig-
natures, Blockchain and anonymous messaging streams.Future direc-
tions for research in privacy solutions are detailed in [37], stressing the
potential for trusted third party monitoring and auditing to detect im-
proper access to data and the need for collaborative efforts across
public, private and academic actors to develop adequate policies and
regulations.
3. Further integration of CI and ML techniques to different aspects
of smart energy system design and operation
The previous section provided an overview of the different concepts
and application areas relating to energy systems in the smart city en-
vironment. In this section, the ML and CI perspective is expanded upon,
detailing suitable techniques for the above applications, while detailing
some of the key future opportunities and challenges for the field.
3.1. Key areas of integration of CI/ML tools for design and operation
The basic premise of smart energy systems is centred on the inter-
actions among multiple entities (end users, generation and distribution
companies, energy markets etc.) and multiple energy vectors and the
use of automated algorithms for control and real time decision making.
Therefore online real time learning from data (e.g. sensor data from
electrical transformers, transmission lines etc. to human behaviour data
like occupancy of buildings from IoT devices) and adaptation of the
decision making and control strategies accordingly, is one of the key
pillars in smart energy management where ML/CI algorithms would
play a significant role. Another broad area where rule-based CI or ex-
pert system approaches are useful for this is in the context of encoding
domain knowledge of the engineering operation, expert judgements for
setting reliable process parameters of adaptive engineering systems.
They would also be able to facilitate more interpretable rule based
automated frameworks which can fuse data from multiple sources and
take actions honouring system constraints and also simultaneously meet
user set objectives. Meta-heuristic optimisation methods from CI are
also useful for designing optimal rating and capacity of smart energy
systems, subject to different system constraints and multiple objectives.
We elaborate these key points and how they can impact the design of
smart energy systems in the next sections.
3.1.1. CI/ML for energy generation/conversion and demand predictions
Energy generation/conversion and demand depends on multiple
factors and data driven ML/CI approaches are useful for modelling and
prediction of these quantities [177,178]. Renewable energy generation
like wind and solar are highly stochastic and dependent on geo-
graphical location (e.g. latitude, elevation, distance from sea etc.) and
temporal aspects of weather (e.g. season of the year, day or night time
etc.) among other variables [179]. These variables also affect energy
demand and usage along with other social and economic factors like
country (developed nations consume more energy per capita than
poorer nations), family size and income, traditions and culture (e.g.
festivities generally increase energy usage) etc. Energy demand can not
only be for heat, gas and electricity usage at homes, it would also be for
other new applications like charging of electric vehicles, trading with
the grid or other peers etc. In such situations, other more complex
variables (say journey plans, congestion in the city etc.) play a sig-
nificant part in the predictions. The key points from the modelling
perspective are that multiple diverse factors are involved, historical
data of many co-variates are available and the inter-dependence of
these factors to the final energy demand or generation is complex. All
these make the usage of ML/CI techniques very attractive. Data driven
learning techniques like neural networks, adaptive neuro fuzzy in-
ference systems (ANFIS), support vector machines (SVMs) etc. are
useful for such cases of regression to generate predictions which can be
integrated in an overall energy management framework. Ensemble
learning [180] which leverages on multiple weak learners to give better
predictive performance than each of the individual learners by boot-
strap aggregating or boosting is also useful in such a context.
As IoT devices become cheaper, sensing will become more pervasive
at homes or end use points of energy [181]. Additional data about
building occupancy, user behaviour etc. would be available in real time
streaming format which can be incorporated into the energy demand
prediction models to improve their predictive accuracy. Data from IoT
enabled home devices like washing machines, microwaves, dish
washers and fridges would also contribute to richer datasets. Sensor
data fusion algorithms would be useful for combining data derived from
diverse sources and CI tools like fuzzy set theory can play a significant
role in such applications.
For most of these CI/ML algorithms, there needs to be a mechanism
for online learning and adaptation to account for the changing patterns
in user behaviour and the load demand profiles. For example, as more
and more renewable generation and EV demand get added to the grid,
both the generation and demand load profiles would look drastically
different from the present scenario. Depending on how fast these
changes would occur, the strategy might be to train the models offline
on past data and update the production level ML/CI models regularly
(e.g. every week or month). If changes are on a more rapid time-scale,
the ML/CI algorithms have to be equipped with online learning in real
time to respond quickly to these changes and have good predictive
accuracy in their forecasts, noting that in many control approaches
(including MPC), the system states are continually updated.
3.1.2. Rule/logic based frameworks for smart energy system operation and
decision making
Conventional ML methods have been successful in a data rich en-
vironment and use cases where the underlying mechanism of the system
is not well understood [182]. Recommender systems in online shopping
stores or video/music content based sites where it is important to
predict what the user might like next based on his current preferences
are two examples. Note that since our present understanding of beha-
vioural choices is limited and there is no exact answer for what a person
would like, it is acceptable for a black box ML/CI algorithm to predict
something which can approximate the user’s preferences.
Contrary to these examples, engineering systems are built and de-
signed in a bottom-up fashion and the working principles are governed
by laws of physics that are generally well understood. There is almost
always a well defined objective and a set suite of methods based on
engineering logic for operating the system under any circumstance. Any
ML/CI algorithm which tries to make automated decisions for operating
engineering systems must do so with this engineering judgement built
into its system. Therefore interpretability regarding the underlying
workings of the ML/CI algorithms and their behaviour in contingency
situations is important to gain faith in such systems [183] and their
consequent uptake and deployment by energy utilities. We therefore
believe that CI/ML techniques which are based on an interpretable set
of rules or logic (say Mamdani fuzzy inference systems, Bayesian net-
works etc.) would be useful in forming the core of a successful energy
management architecture. These systems might leverage other black
box ML/CI techniques (e.g. neural networks) by having their predic-
tions as inputs into the system, but the core decision making system
should never be a black box ML/CI algorithm. A high level review of the
short-comings of such black box deep learning methods has been cov-
ered in [184] and interpretability of the ML methods is one of the key
issues (along with others like being data hungry, poor incorporation of
prior knowledge, trust concerns etc.).
Another way in which CI/ML based control of energy infrastructure
differs from that of popular ML applications mentioned above, is that of
reliability and the significant costs/penalty associated with malopera-
tion of such systems. Reliable supply of energy is an important public
utility service and shutting down such systems due to some automated
ML/CI black box algorithm is detrimental to the revenue, consumer
satisfaction and public confidence in the company. Moreover, if the
algorithm operates the engineering system in such a way that it induces
mechanical or thermal stresses into the system (say multiple hot start-
ups of a power plant within a short interval) it would lead to reduced
life time of the system and consequent increase in overall power cost.
Other cases of maloperation, (e.g. running power plant milling equip-
ment or turbines at high speeds) might actually lead to mechanical
breakdowns and property damage leading to significant business in-
terruption.
Such interpretable rule based systems can also be deployed as em-
bedded smart solutions for end users which can leverage on smart meter
data and real time energy pricing from decentralised generation sources
to take optimal decisions on behalf of the user depending on user
specified objectives like cost minimisation or comfort maximisation.
3.1.3. Meta-heuristic optimisation methods for smart energy system
planning and design
Evolutionary and swarm based optimisers can be useful over other
traditional methods (e.g. convex optimisation, mixed integer non-linear
programming etc.) especially in cases where the function to be opti-
mised is discontinuous, noisy, multi-modal or cannot be expressed in
closed mathematical equations and requires simulation based tools.
Given the stochastic (noisy) renewable generation and load profiles of
these systems, complex interactions between multiple stakeholders
(requiring agent based or other simulation based approaches to model)
and uncertainties in how the interactions and energy system landscape
would pan out in the future, the use of meta-heuristic optimisers is an
attractive proposition. These optimisers are useful at the design and
planning stage for optimal design of smart energy systems given the
current energy infrastructure, future demand and other objectives like
cost and reliability of operation [185]. Robust meta-heuristic optimi-
sation methods are useful in taking into account the model un-
certainties and ensuring that the designed system gives similar levels of
performance even if the real system variables are slightly different from
the simulated system. Evolutionary and swarm based multi-objective
optimisation methods are also suitable for design of systems with
multiple contradictory objectives, such as system efficiency, cost, re-
liability etc. Pareto optimal solutions (whereby no further improvement
to one objective can be obtained except at the detriment of at least one
other objective) obtained from these optimisers would help quantify the
best possible trade-offs under a given set of engineering constraints and
objectives.
Such optimisation methods could also be useful in the context of
real-time decision making and control in an energy management
system. These might be used as add-ons to a rule-based system with the
requirement to deliver results in real time. Other applications would be
the adaptive update of controller parameters based on varying process
parameters, online system identification etc. However, evolutionary
algorithms are typically not suited to real time implementation and
need to be run multiple times as convergence is not guaranteed. If the
objective function can be written down using a simple set of linear or
non-linear closed set of form mathematical equations then its best to
use fast iterative techniques such as convex optimisation or sequential
quadratic programming. If the objective function can only be expressed
in the form of computationally expensive simulation code, then surro-
gate model based optimisation [186] or Bayesian optimisation can be
useful to obtain optimised values in a short duration. Even then, it
might not be suitable for real-time update at each time step. These
techniques might be used to compute the optimal parameters of the
system offline and then update the online algorithm after specified time
intervals (e.g. a few hours) using, for example, adaptive look-up tables.
3.2. Challenges and shortcomings of present CI/ML tools
Most ML/CI techniques are designed to be trained offline and then
the trained model is deployed in production mode. There are fewer
research methods that look into efficient and fast methods for recursive
online updating of these model parameters for real-time streaming data.
One way to circumvent this problem is to make near real-time updates
by batch processing historical data offline to re-train the models and
deploying the retrained models at regular (e.g. daily or weekly) inter-
vals. This method would capture medium to long-term trends but might
miss out on shorter-term trends in energy demand and prediction.
Consequently, the automated decision making and control algorithms
might be sub-optimal.
Most ML models are black boxes and lack interpretability.
Introducing prior judgement in terms of the model structure or rules
might make them interpretable but this almost always results in a
consequent decrease in predictive accuracy of these models as the data
might not actually conform to the intuition or judgement of the experts
as encoded in the model structure. Some research has been geared to-
wards training neural networks and then trying to extract rules algor-
ithmically from the trained model. In general this tends to produce
superfluous rules or ones which are not necessarily logically consistent
or make practical sense. A more comprehensive review of different
approaches to interpreting such black box models can be found in
[187]. More research needs to be done on the interpretability aspects if
CI/ML methods need to be tightly integrated in smart energy systems.
The recent trend in ML is to move from point predictions of outputs
(either class labels for classification tasks or real valued predictions for
regressions etc.) to predictive distributions which explicitly capture the
uncertainty in the output [188]. This is especially important as part of a
larger decision making framework where uncertainty propagates across
multiple levels (as can be the case in the hierarchically structured en-
ergy domain). Computing uncertainties in predictions as opposed to
maximum likelihood point estimates is also computationally expensive.
Numerical methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be
used in a Bayesian framework to quantify parameter uncertainties for
models but MCMC is inherently a sequential algorithm and parallelising
it or scaling it up for high volume of data is difficult. Various approx-
imate methods like variational inference exist but they might not al-
ways give realistic estimates of the uncertainties [189]. Other non-
parametric techniques like Gaussian Processes might be used to have
good predictive accuracy along with uncertainties, but they do not scale
very well with large data-sets [190]. Advances in Sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) techniques [191] would be especially useful for energy
management applications due to the nature of the streaming time series
data in such systems.
3.3. Future research directions in CI/ML relevant to the context of smart
energy systems
One of the key concerns for smart multi-vector energy systems is the
risks associated with integrating all these different energy networks
together. There might be cascaded failures where failure of one of the
energy vector networks might trip the whole system and cause cata-
strophic damages. Appropriately designed CI/ML tools should be able
to detect such failures and take corrective action in real time to limit the
extent of damage, for example, by islanding a particular area or
network. The energy management system should also be able to suggest
and operate the network in fall-back option mode in the event of such
exigencies. The other key desirable functionality of such a system is to
ensure how to recover fully or restore to a partial state, a working
energy network after a blackout or failure has occurred. CI/ML algo-
rithms would play a significant role in detecting when and what failure
has occurred, what parts of the energy infrastructure has been affected
and what is the best possible alternative to restore the system.
Since much of the system dynamics can depend on the actions taken
by the smart algorithms themselves, the design and planning of such
smart energy systems should explicitly implement these algorithms in
simulation and stress test different scenarios to understand the asso-
ciated risks in the operation of such systems. Game theoretical ap-
proaches, for example, can then be used to uncover vulnerabilities.
Another potential hazard in interconnecting energy networks is that
there would be increased risk of damage due to cyber-attacks and the
consequent losses would be more severe. This would be aggravated by
linking up these networks to the internet for essential services, such as
data sharing platforms (common in smart city applications), cloud
storage or high performance cloud computing back-ends used for run-
ning the algorithms in real time. Research also needs to be done to
ensure that CI/ML algorithms can detect network intrusion, understand
unauthorised access and can take appropriate actions to mitigate cat-
astrophic consequences of such attacks.
As embedded smart energy systems become more and more perva-
sive, the energy network would become more decentralised with de-
velopments such as peer-to-peer trading of energy and sale of energy
from vehicle to grid. CI/ML algorithms must be present at multiple
levels/scales (building scale, community scale, district scale, nation
scale etc.) and should be able to ensure stability and reliable operation
of the grid in spite of such uncertain operating conditions.
One common push-back against the wide adaptability of such in-
telligent systems for fully automated real time operation and decision
making is the reliability and confidence in CI/ML algorithms, especially
in abnormal situations. Formal verification methods or automated
model checking for CI/ML systems might be an avenue to explore to
ensure that smart energy systems designed with CI/ML components
would not go into unsafe states or modes of operation even in abnormal
situations. On the other hand, these methods should provide support for
detecting incipient faults prior to the manifestation of an abnormal si-
tuation.
4. Real world implementation cases and considerations for Smart
Cities
Though the benefits of exploiting the increased smartness of cities to
achieve efficient energy system integration have been well established,
with techniques, applications and opportunities summarised in detail in
the previous sections, the real-world implementation of such strategies
requires the navigation of many practical barriers. These include the
range of stakeholders required from both private and public sectors, the
level of expertise needed, the conflicting objectives of different actors,
the capital cost of such large scale interventions and the uncertainty
surrounding the expected benefits (particularly from a financial per-
spective). Furthermore, as noted in [192], effective smart cities emerge
as a result of a variety of interacting components, which can differ
between cities. A comprehensive overview of the different barriers can
be found in [193]. Nonetheless, a large number of projects have been
carried out or are currently in progress that seek to demonstrate the
potential in the sector - a white paper categorising many of the main
examples globally was compiled by the UK-based Future Cities Catapult
for example, in [194]. In this section, considerations for implementing
smart integrated energy solutions are discussed based on real world
examples.
4.1. The replicability challenge
The holistic nature of Smart Cities has led to a diverse spectrum of
characterisation approaches. In [195], 181 cities are ranked in terms of
performance across 10 metrics to provide an impression of overall
smartness. The rankings show that the current state of progress varies
significantly with geographical location, with many high-ranking cities
clustered in Europe. Despite this, global urbanisation trends and the
consequential need for infrastructural development ensures that growth
in the sector is not confined to the current European and North
American centres - the Indian context is outlined for example in [196],
while the growth of Smart Cities in China is described in [197]. As
noted in [198] however, the evolution patterns of smart cities highly
depend on the local context, affected by variables such as population
density, economic development, cultural priorities, political structures
and climate to name but a few. Even within individual cities, require-
ments and barriers can vary across different districts and neighbour-
hoods depending on building age, infrastructural make-up and demo-
graphic profiles. As such, district-level interventions are often favoured
over city-wide approaches [199,200]. A single template or one-size-fits-
all set of solutions is unlikely to be achievable. Acknowledging this, a
theoretical framework for analysing business models through the use of
qualitative indicators is developed in [201]. This can allow adminis-
trators to avoid potential pitfalls and shape decisions to fit a particular
context. In [202], the cities of Montreal, London and Stockholm are
studied to examine the approaches for strategizing smart cities. The
authors stress the need to integrate many multidisciplinary resources in
any strategy developed.
4.2. Data handling & system integration
One common theme that tends to cut across all contexts is the need
for appropriate platforms to manage the data streams from the various
assets. The London data store [203] is an example of such a platform,
allowing open access to statistics and datasets. An example in which
such platforms have been leveraged to enable smart management of the
underlying systems can be found in Padova [23], where an open data
and ICT platform initially used to measure environmental variables was
extended to include a smart lighting strategy. In Santander, transpor-
tation issues such as congestion, parking and driver guidance were
tackled using this integrated data [204,22]. Similarly, the Smart Brain
strategy developed by Alibaba [205] was implemented in Hangzhou to
take various social media and traffic information to reduce average
travel time by 10%.
Focussing on consumption, monitoring of water and electricity
consumption with smart meters in homes enabled guidelines and in-
centives to be provided to residents in Dubuque [206]. Building further
on such concepts, a smart solar neighbourhood was developed in Nice
[207,208,22] to integrate distributed electricity generation and solar
power forecasts using thermal storage and intelligent demand man-
agement. In addition to this, the city introduced smart transportation
and smart waste management strategies as well as smart lighting.
4.3. Demonstrators and living labs
Identifying a definitive business case for integrated energy solutions
has proven to be a challenge, with the involvement of many actors and
benefactors required. As such, many recent Smart City projects have
sought to act not solely as technical test-beds, but as starting points for
wider scale-up. From a technical point of view, this requires quantifi-
able performance indicators, while also providing guidelines for
handling the financial and governance challenges involved, as well as
the wider social impact. In the UK electricity industry, this has led to
demonstration projects centred on the development of large-scale smart
grids while piloting innovative consumer services and commercial ar-
rangements [209–211]. In several European cities such as Helsinki
[212,213], and Barcelona [214], multi-purpose test-beds have similarly
been established to implement and evaluate various solutions to over-
come specific city challenges. Such Living Labs enable a better under-
standing of the challenges faced prior to full-scale roll-out of a solution,
as well as providing more concrete performance figures and business
cases. In [206], the development of similar demonstrators globally
(including in Seoul and Rio de Janeiro) with IBM is discussed. Given the
purpose of these living labs as generators of insight, the importance of
understanding the holistic outcomes of such projects (particularly be-
yond the technical perspective) where private ownership is involved is
discussed in [215].
4.4. EU Smart Cities and Communities call projects
A number of ambitious projects centred on the development of
scalable Smart City interventions are currently in progress, as part of
the EU H2020 call for Smart Cities and Communities. To encourage
large-scale replication of the demonstrators, interventions in each
project are first developed and implemented in a different set of light-
house cities, while the methods and learnings are taken on by a set of
follower cities with the intention of replicating similar projects. The
focus of all such projects is on integrated commercial-scale solutions
with high market potential in the fields of energy, transport and ICT
[216]. Once again, integrated ICT forms a central part of all these
projects. Beyond this, wide ranging topics and solutions encompassing
smart grids, district heating and transport are proposed (as well as
numerous other branches of the smart city concept). Of particular sig-
nificance is the focus on implementation and scalability, illustrating the
current state of the sector, moving from a conceptual phase to one of
more tangible realisation. The projects in the call are listed in Table 1.
All of the above give a generic overview of the on-going and recent
projects and applications in the context of smart energy systems for
smart cities. To better illustrate the challenges faced in real time im-
plementation, the following section details the energy management
strategy development for one of these smart city projects that our group
is involved in, outlining the current status and vision for the future of
the work.
5. Overview of energy management in the ‘Sharing Cities’ project
and vision for the future
In this section, an overview is provided of the approach to be taken
for managing an integrated set of energy networks in the Borough of
Greenwich, developed as part of the London branch of the “Sharing
Cities” project. The energy management strategy developed is referred
to as the Sustainable Energy Management System (SEMS). The over-
view highlights some of the main control and data handling con-
siderations and challenges faced in such a project.
5.1. System overview & architecture
A number of assets are included in the proposed strategy, with the
overall scheme encountering many of the key challenges of the domain,
including the electrification of both heating and transport, the inclusion
of renewable generation and the provision of storage. It is proposed that
a set of apartments are to be fed by a low-temperature heat network
supplied by a combination of water source heat pumps, thermal stores
and additional boilers (acting as a back-up). Open-access EV charge-
points are to be installed in the region, as well as an additional e-bike
scheme. Photovoltaic panels are also to be installed to increase re-
newable generation in the borough. The apartment block considered in
the strategy consists of 95 apartments of various shapes, ranging from
two-person to five-person in size and built of solid brick. The building,
constructed in 1937, is to be retrofitted with radiators suited to a low
temperature heating system. The proposed retrofit includes the in-
stallation of apartment-level smart controllers to which user-specific
set-point schedules can be applied. These communicate through a Z-
wave protocol with Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs) to manage the
radiators. Energy meters, heat meters, sensors associated with the
supply-side equipment and the smart control gateways are hardwired to
the central energy centre, with all data passed to the SCADA system.
The various system components and assets are shown in Fig. 1. The
increased use of electrical power to satisfy thermal and transport de-
mands is likely to increase the stress on the local power network, par-
ticularly if load peaks from the different demands coincide. The un-
certainty associated with the increased renewable penetration must also
be handled by the power grid. Coordination of the different supplies
and demands, in particular, exploiting the energy storage capability
available in the heat network and the apartments themselves is there-
fore paramount.
5.2. Control strategy
The SEMS seeks to guide the operation of the different individual
system components in a manner that is, in some sense, optimal (whereby
optimality is dependent on the definition of the specific objectives
chosen), while providing intelligent coordination strategies to ensure
the overarching system constraints are satisfied. The potential exists for
objectives across different components to conflict at times and so the
global objective (insofar as a single objective can be identified) may not
correspond with individual local objectives. Nonetheless, due to the
desire for optimal operation coupled with the presence of environ-
mental forecasts and large numbers of inputs, outputs and constraints,
solutions based on MPC are a natural fit.
5.2.1. Hierarchical structure
Allowing for communication latency and computation time, 15min
time-samples are chosen for the MPC-layer. Such a sample-time is too
long for robust operation of the lowest control layer, associated with
proportionalintegralderivative (PID) and rule-based controlled actua-
tors, valves, pumps etc. In the control hierarchy, the MPC-layer gen-
erates set-point trajectories which are fed to the autonomous lower-
layer, which is designed and operated in a standard fashion. Such an
arrangement is typical in process control to ensure robust operation in
cases whereby the predictive layer misbehaves [226].
5.2.2. System constraints
Each individual component has associated physical operating con-
straints, while additional constraints are imposed at an overarching
system-level (for example, the total electrical capacity of the local
distribution network). In this case, some of the main constraints are:
•comfort in each apartment is maintained as requested
•the electricity grid is not over-stressed
•EV charge-points are operated according to the owners specifica-
tions
•all individual assets are operated within specific physical limits
(including outputs, ramp-up rates, operating time etc.)
5.2.3. Objectives
From a whole-system perspective, multiple objectives are present.
Once again these objectives appear at multiple scales, with each dif-
ferent actor representing a different purpose. Some of the key objectives
are as follows:
•minimise financial operating cost for all actors (building occupants,
government, EV users, asset owners, etc.)
•minimise the overall environmental impact of system
•minimise EV-charger curtailment
•maximise renewable penetration
Naturally, these objectives are not mutually exclusive and conflicts
can exist, necessitating a suitable coordination approach.
As alluded to, the goal of the control framework is to optimally
coordinate the different energy assets in the region, operating the in-
dividual components so as to satisfy the wider system constraints, while
minimising environmental and economic impacts (by exploiting
varying energy prices). A challenging feature of the energy sector at this
scale however, is the diverse range of stakeholders, impacted actors and
beneficiaries with different objectives. Considering each asset in-
dependently can lead to higher level system constraint violation, for
example, if EV charging peaks coincide with those of the heat pump
heating load, the power network may become over-stressed.
Furthermore, even if all components and system constraints are han-
dled within a single centralised framework, the different objectives can
lead to conflicting requests, for example, maximising the PV panel
output on the supply-side while minimising power consumption on the
user-side may lead to an unstable power grid.
5.2.4. The overall SEMS control architecture
Bringing together these aspects, the complete architecture of the
proposed control strategy - the SEMS - is shown in Fig. 2. To ensure
robust operation, the lowest control layer (the actuation layer) follows a
typical classical approach based on PID and rule-based controllers. This
layer includes the Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs) in each apart-
ment, the pumps and valves used to actuate the heat pumps, boilers and
stores, and the switches associated with all other electrical assets.
The set-point trajectories for the actuators are provided by the
middle, MPC-based layer. In this case, two separate MPC controllers are
implemented, however additional controllers can be added in a mod-
ular fashion if further assets are to be included. This modular form
enables the system scale to be increased without requiring a complete
reformulation and without excessive complexity. The MPC controllers
take measurements, weather forecasts, energy prices and user-defined
set-point schedules at fifteen minute intervals, calculating at each time-
step an optimal set-point trajectory for the following of 12h. The
models used by these MPC controllers are typically in a standard linear
state-space form, with quadratic objectives. The model parameters and
form can then be chosen to ensure convexity with a reasonable solution
time - open-source solvers from the CVXOPT package in Python for
example can be used to solve the optimisation problems. A further
important consideration here due to the use of historical data to gen-
erate future predictions is the data storage requirement. While data
storage is available here (specifically through the London Data Store),
accumulation of excess data over-time is to be avoided by the use of
recursive parameter estimation approaches.
In the top layer of the formulation, the projected heating and
electricity loads for the different assets are taken from the MPC con-
trollers. The purpose of this layer is to ensure that the combined loads
recommended by the multiple MPC controllers do not lead to constraint
violation at a system-wide level. The challenge of coordinated control
and the relative merits of centralised and decentralised formulations
have been well established [227]. Objectives can be balanced through
an appropriate selection of weights [228] or prioritised frameworks
[54], while higher-level coordination layers and game theoretic ap-
proaches [152] can allow for interaction between otherwise isolated
controllers to ensure all actors are satisfied in a manner that can be
considered fair. Depending on user-preference, two options are ex-
plored here. Firstly, an approach can be implemented in which addi-
tional hard constraints are applied to the MPC layer in the event of
high-level constraint violation following pre-defined rules. In the
second approach, an iterative procedure is used in which excessively
large power requests are penalised in the objectives of the MPC layer in
an increasing manner until system-wide constraints are fulfilled. The
former option is more robust, however, the need for pre-defined rules
inhibits the scalability of the overall scheme.
5.3. Multi-vector energy system simulation environment
5.3.1. Pre-implementation control design
Though the central purpose of the project is to implement the de-
rived algorithms in the real world, a necessary prior stage in the de-
velopment of the proposed control strategy is the creation of a simu-
lation environment or digital twin that can accurately represent the
temporal dynamics of the real-world systems. This is important for
several reasons. Firstly, any formulated algorithms must be rigorously
tested to ensure a smooth transition to the real environment. Given the
innovative nature of the proposed solutions, the specificity of the
challenges faced and the potential impact that would arise in the event
of error in the real system, this testing is paramount. Secondly, the long
time-scales and high expense associated with the system prohibits any
excessive periods of reformulation or tuning - preferably this should be
done in advance of implementation. Additionally, to assess and com-
pare the performance of different strategies in an unbiased manner, all
external factors and covariates should be identical from one experiment
to the next. In an environment such as this, whereby the weather plays
a conspicuous role, this is only possible in simulation. Finally, to inform
potential stakeholders of the possibilities and benefits of various control
strategies in a quantifiable manner, simulated case studies can be car-
ried out without many of the barriers associated with real-world im-
plementation. This next section provides detail of the digital twin de-
veloped for this Sharing Cities project.
5.3.2. The digital twin
The purpose of the digital twin is to combine the various generation,
storage and demand units in a single platform that can communicate
with an external control framework in the same manner as the real
system. To allow for different assets to be included in a modular
fashion, a suitable co-simulation environment is required. In this case,
the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) environment is used
[229], which itself is based on the Ptolemy II environment [230]. In this
case, the simulated energy systems comprise of a heating network, the
apartment block it supplies, a set of EV charge stations, a set of PV
panels, a number of e-bikes and lamp posts, along with the electricity
grid and the gas grid. Profiles representing external variables such as
weather (temperature, solar irradiance etc.) and energy prices (gas and
electricity) are also included.
To represent the thermal dynamics of the apartment block,
EnergyPlus building energy simulation software is used. EnergyPlus is a
whole building simulation package [231], capable of incorporating the
physical properties of the building as well as the heating system or
cooling system configurations and settings with weather data and oc-
cupancy schedules to produce temperatures, heat flows and water flows
throughout the building envelope. Elaborating on work carried out as
part of the EU H2020 funded MOEEBIUS project [232], the dimensions
of the apartment block and an appropriate set of building materials are
set to enable accurate simulation of the thermal dynamics of the
building, down to a granularity of 60 s time samples.
The heating network consists of water-source heat pumps, boilers,
thermal stores, pumps, valves and the PI-controllers needed to instigate
all of the above in the same manner as the real system. These are
modelled in Ptolemy II based on standard heat transfer and mass
balance equations (including heat losses) with Coefficient of
Performance (COP) curves taken from manufacturers’ data used to re-
present the efficiencies of the boilers and heat pumps. The flow tem-
perature and flow rate of the heat network are passed to the EnergyPlus
model, which then sends back the return temperature. Other compo-
nents, such as EV chargers, e-bikes and environmental variables are
instigated as time-varying profiles, generated based on typical uptake
values with pseudo-random variations added.
All sensors present in the real system are represented in simulation,
with all relevant measurements pushed to the control layer via a web
application framework (in this case, using Flask [233]). The purpose is
to directly replace the digital twin with the real system, thus the control
layer, developed here in Python, is equivalent to that of the real system.
In the same manner as the real system, it pushes set-point trajectory
recommendations back to the digital twin. The complete architecture of
the digital twin and its link with the SEMS is shown in Fig. 3.
5.4. Additional challenges for the SEMS
The design and implementation of the outlined scheme in the real
system introduces number of technical challenges. This section briefly
summarises some of those that have been encountered or are antici-
pated.
The development of suitable Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs) to enable different actors access and view the behaviour and
performance of the installed systems is required. This must include
appropriate methods for visualisation, specifically illustrating the de-
cisions made by SEMS and the impact of these decisions to any actors
affected (positively or negatively) by these decisions. Crucially, this
must be achieved without infringing on the privacy of the individuals
behind the data (in this case, the occupants of the apartments are an
important example).
An issue that arises in the control of multi-vector energy systems is
the need to consider multiple time-scales. This is largely due to the
differences present in the thermal behaviour of systems such as build-
ings and the far higher-frequency dynamics of electrical networks. The
time-scales needed to provide frequency response services to the elec-
trical network for example, are clearly different to those needed to
manage the thermal store. The strategy and its associated functions and
objectives must be appropriately designed with this in mind, while all
discrete-time models used must be derived to ensure stability at the
relevant sample-times.
Though the potential improvements available through the im-
plementation of strategies such as this have been enabled by the pro-
liferation of data (as covered in Section 2 of this paper), the need to
effectively manage a large number of data streams is in itself a sig-
nificant challenge (an overview of this area of the smart cities domain is
provided in [234] as a guide). Data platforms and suitable APIs must be
developed and implemented to handle the various formats and inter-
faces associated with each of the assets. Historical data must be stored
to enable system design, modelling and analysis to be carried out while
privacy concerns must also be understood and mitigated.
Suitable KPIs and metrics must be developed to assess the perfor-
mance of the designed approach. Once again, these must consider the
various complementary and conflicting objectives present in the multi-
stakeholder landscape. To provide insight into the real-world perfor-
mance, extended monitoring periods are required, long enough to
capture typical seasonal variations while ensuring that temporal
anomalies do not dominate the results. In addition to monitoring the
performance of the scheme, a similarly rigorous approach must be
taken to monitor the system behaviour without coordination to enable
valid baseline performances to be understood, though a certain amount
of this burden can be carried by the digital twin.
Scalability is key to the long-term success of any Smart City solu-
tions. As referred to in the previous section, the scheme is designed to
enable modular expansion if additional systems are to be incorporated.
Despite this, time and expertise are needed to carry out the required
modelling and control design for any new assets brought in.
Furthermore, all impacted actors must be considered in any further
system integration, as well as any spatial changes. In [235] for example,
the need to consider the impact of regionally varying energy pricing
when planning energy conservation measure implementation is ex-
pounded. Such issues can affect any performance metrics determined.
As system connectivity and complexity increases, ensuring system
resilience can become more challenging. Cascade failures [236] and
communication faults must now be mitigated, with suitable failure
modes designed. As previously discussed, the control architecture is
founded on a layer of standard controllers, which in the event of a loss
of communication, can operate the various assets in an isolated manner.
Aside from this however, measures must be included to prevent in-
dividual faults (sensor, actuator or model faults) from propagating
throughout the system [228]. Once again, the digital twin can play a
role in the required analysis for this.
6. Conclusion
This paper surveys the current directions in smart energy systems
for smart cities and draws on our insights in developing a large scale EU
pilot project for real time implementation of the same. Current appli-
cation areas are first addressed, including data handling and
technological advances in the built environment and transport sectors,
as well as cooridnation and integration methods for exploiting sym-
bioses across different energy domains. The potential use of ML and CI
approaches to tackle specific future challenges in the area is also ex-
panded upon. Along with theoretical developments, we also look at the
practical aspects of real time implementation and understanding the
way the smart city concept is formalised for these real world cases, we
can envision how and where different CI and ML paradigms can be
integrated. This would help to inform other researchers working on
more theoretical aspects and help understand which are the high im-
pact areas to focus on and also possibly help in guiding the budding
research community in this area to challenges motivated by real world
case studies.Spatially resolved mean and unsteady surface pressure in swept SBLI using PSP
Abstract 
Strong crossflow and swept separation are key aspects of the flow dynamics of 3-D shock wave/boundary layer interactions. This study explores the global surface pressure field beneath the canonical interaction produced by a sharp fin with deflection angle 15◦ with a turbulent incoming boundary in a Mach 2 freestream flow. This corresponds to an interaction of moderate strength, and the unsteady pressure distribution captures pressure fluctuations associated with separation shock motion upstream of the interaction. Details of the PSP calibration are also described where the calibration process combines both a priori (with separately painted test coupon) and in situ calibration (with pressure tap measurements during test). Flow features are identified directly from the quantitative pressure distribution and compared to qualitative surface oil flow visualizations. The technique facilitates measurement of the pressure distribution on surfaces that have been difficult or impossible to instrument, such as the face of the shock-generating fin. The unsteady paint response is captured simultaneously with unsteady pressure transducers on the surface underneath the interaction, and a frequency response function based on this comparison is presented. As the results discussed herein demonstrate, the use of PSP allows one to capture significantly more information about this complex, highly three-dimensional interaction with details that are not easily obtained using traditional sensors, while also providing a more informed global view of the interaction. The utility and limitations of the technique in application to supersonic wind tunnel experiments are discussed. 

1 Introduction 
Experiments to capture surface pressure fields in shock wave/boundary layer interactions are motivated by the ubiquity of the phenomenon in supersonic external aerodynamics and its direct application to the development of next-generation high-speed air transport systems (Urzay 2018). Strong shock wave interactions are accompanied by adverse pressure gradients that can separate the incoming boundary layer, producing highly unsteady pressure forces and heat flux that have been historically challenging to predict, even in relatively simple geometries (Dolling 2001). The complex 3-D flows in swept interactions are the focus of many computational studies, which require experimental validation through wind tunnel or flight testing (Panaras 1996; Gaitonde 2015). With recent advances in diagnostics, significantly more instantaneous measurements are becoming feasible while also producing new validation datasets including plenoptic (Jones et al. 2018) and tomographic PIV (Humble et al. 2009; Threadgill and Little 2018) for volumetric flowfield measurements. When coupled with surface pressure fields, these provide rich insight into flow physics. A relatively new technique for acquiring spatially resolved surface pressure fields is pressure-sensitive paint (PSP), which is an alternative to arrays of traditional pressure taps. PSP has demonstrated improved spatial resolution over individual pressure taps, but with additional expense, complexity of light and camera setups, and potentially greater error. It is not yet clear which experimental configurations and flow conditions benefit from the inherent trade-offs. Recent reviews (Gregory et al. 2008, 2014) track the maturation of PSP in wide-ranging experimental applications, which include impinging jets (Davis et al. 2015), transonic swept wings (Sugioka et al. 2018), and cavity resonance (Casper et al. 2018). Experimental configurations that use PSP to study supersonic flows include blunt fin-generated SBLI (Raju and Viswanath 2005), jets in crossflow (Crafton et al. 2015) , swept fins on a cone (Turbeville and Schneider 2018), swept impinging SBLI (Padmanabhan et al. 2019), and curved inlets (Funderburk and Narayanaswamy 2019). The development of reliable, short-response-time paints for capturing unsteady pressure fluctuations remains an active area of research and is becoming increasingly specialized for different flow regimes (Sugioka et al. 2018; Sugimoto et al. 2017). Unsteady tests offer additional challenges in illumination, since paint excitation for each frame decreases with higher camera frame rates. Because the paint emission decreases with higher static pressure, experiments with subatmospheric surface pressures result in increased signalto-noise ratios and can take advantage of shorter exposure times. Temperature sensitivity, which can be effectively mitigated in steady paint response using a dual-luminophore technique described in Sect. 2, remains a source of error in unsteady pressure measurements. The benefits afforded by the high surface resolution of this image-based measurement are balanced by relatively higher uncertainty due to influences of camera noise, temperature, light source nonuniformity, and paint degradation. Additionally, the associated costs of the camera, lights, and paints remain higher than a typical low-noise static pressure transducer system used for time-averaged measurements, and so the value of higher spatial resolution must be justified. Sharp fin interactions produce a number of complex flow features that are of particular interest to researchers seeking to better understand flows experienced by real vehicles (Alvi and Settles 1992; Dolling 2001). An oblique shock generated at the leading edge of the fin sweeps over incoming boundary layer, and sufficient pressure rise separates the boundary layer, shown in Fig. 1. Early models of this flowfield describe the helical separation vortex, deduced largely from surface oil flow visualizations (Korkegi 1975; Kubota and Stollery 1981). Detailed observations of the flowfield structure and recent quantitative studies of flow properties across a wide range of Mach numbers and fin angles have been completed (Alvi and Settles 1990; Kim et al. 1991; Lu and Settles 1990; Arora et al. 2018). The single sharp fin-generated swept interaction produces high unsteady pressure forces and heat fluxes in the mid- and high frequency (St> 0.05) related to shear layer dynamics (Garg and Settles 1996; Arora and Alvi 2016; Adler and Gaitonde 2017), but it is not clear whether models used to describe dynamics of two-dimensional interactions exhibiting “closed” separation are applicable to flows displaying “open” separation, such as the current interaction (Dolling 2001). The inherent three dimensionality of swept interactions makes well-resolved measurements that elucidate flow physics more expensive, requiring distributed measurements of surface pressure. The single sharp fin-generated swept SBLI is often simplified by assuming conical symmetry of flow features, which is observed some distance downstream of the fin leading edge (Lu and Settles 1990). The length required to attain conical symmetry, known as the inception length, has been shown to vary with incoming boundary layer properties and interaction strength. The PSP measurement resolution, which would be insufficient if traditional pressure taps were used, permits analysis of inceptive scales that are present within an interaction and hint at different physical mechanisms within the flowfield. The current effort details experiments in two supersonic testing facilities to evaluate steady and unsteady PSP response underneath a complex, 3-D flow. This paper strives to cover critical issues of calibration and application to supersonic experiments. A novel method of correcting the unsteady PSP response for temperature is also presented. 

2 Pressuresensitive paint (PSP) models 
The underlying processes for accurate pressure measurements using PSP are briefly described in the following section; a comprehensive history and theory are available in Liu and Sullivan (2005). The photophysical parameters that influence the measured radiative emission are limited to pressure and temperature, since nonuniformities in luminophore application and excitation light are corrected by calculating ratios of images at known pressure conditions. The chemical process is governed by oxygen quenching, whereby the intensity of light emanating from the paint under ultraviolet excitation is a strong function of the concentration of oxygen surrounding special luminophore molecules. By taking a ratio of images acquired at known pressure conditions and the unknown test conditions, nonuniformities in lighting and luminophore distribution are accounted for and the resulting ratio is modeled by the reduced Stern–Volmer equation (Liu and Sullivan 2005): where I represents the image intensity (of a single pixel), P is pressure of that point, and subscript ref signifies the intensity and pressure at the known reference condition. The coefficients A(T) and B(T) are found empirically, and several authors have found that quadratic fits requiring an additional coefficient are more appropriate (Sugioka et al. 2018; Schreivogel et al. 2012). The present experiments use an exponential fit for pressure calibration of the steady PSP and a quadratic calibration for unsteady PSP. The active molecule that is presently used in both time-averaged and unsteady PSP is a platinum porphyrin (PtTFPP), which is receptive to excitation near 395 nm and emits near 650 nm. The steady PSP, which is known as binary fluoride-isopropyl-butyl (FIB) PSP, contains PtTFPP and an additional luminophore suspended in the FIB binder. The second luminophore, which is relatively insensitive to pressure, is captured simultaneously to correct for the temperature dependence of PtTFPP; the emission is close to 550 nm and can be captured on separate channels (red and green) using a commercially available color CCD camera 

3 Experimental methodology Experiments were carried out in two intermittent supersonic blow-down wind tunnels with different test section dimensions and boundary layer properties. The application of PSP is used to better understand the properties of this flowfield and to discover scaling parameters due to the differences in model size and boundary layer thickness, among others. Specifications of the facilities, PSP technique, and data processing methods are described in the following sections. 
3.1 Experimental facilities The experiments are conducted at similar freestream conditions within two supersonic wind tunnels, but with different incoming boundary layer properties, test section dimensions, and model dimensions. Comparisons of test conditions between the two tunnels at Mach 2, including boundary layer properties, are summarized in Table 1. The compressible boundary layer profile of Sun and Childs (1973) is used to define the velocity profile in the wake region, which is matched to the Musker (1979) log layer and buffer layer velocity profile. The temperature profile for the turbulent boundary layer is obtained through the modified Crocco–Busemann relation described in White (2006). 
The test section of the pilot tunnel measures 101.6 mm wide, 76.2 mm tall, and 254 mm long (4′′ × 3′′ × 12′′). The shock-generating fin is placed at an angle of15◦ with respect to the freestream Mach 2 flow and is 37.5 mm (1.48 inches) tall and 76.2 mm (3 inches) long. The leading edge of the fin is machined to a sharpness of 7°. Total pressure is measured in the stagnation chamber using a Omega PX-305 pressure transducer. All tests were conducted at a stagnation pressure of 345 kPa, stagnation temperature of 289 K, and freestream velocity of 510 m/s. The boundary layer thickness at the leading edge of the fin that is estimated from PIV to be 3.5 ± 0.2 mm (Arora et al. 2015), and compressible shape factor is 2.99. The model is mounted on the test section ceiling so that cameras could be mounted underneath the test section, which reduces the effects of vibration on acquired images. Companion experiments are conducted in the Florida State University Polysonic Wind Tunnel (PSWT), also in a Mach 2 freestream flow and fin deflection angle of 15°, but with a larger model (101.6 mm (4 inches) tall and 127 mm (5 inches) in length) and fin leading edge angle of 25°. The test section has a square cross section measuring 304.8 mm on all four sides and measures 609.6 mm in length (12′′ × 12′′ × 24′′). The test model is mounted on the floor of the test section, and high-quality optical windows are installed in the ceiling and sidewalls for camera/light source access. Both pressure-sensitive paints were applied to the test article in the same manner, using a hobby-type airbrush for both basecoat and photo-active layers. Image registration, preprocessing, and the procedure for converting light intensity ratios to pressure values are performed identically between the two facilities. 
3.2 Surface oil flow visualization A common technique for characterizing flow topology is surface oil flow visualization. In current tests, equal parts light mineral oil and red fluorescent powder dye are thoroughly mixed and airbrushed onto the model to produce even coverage of small (< 0.3 mm diameter) droplets. This dye is illuminated with high-intensity LEDs with a wavelength of 400 nm (ISSI), and images are captured at 15 Hz using an AVT GigE monochrome camera with Nikon f/1.4 50 mm lens. A long-pass filter with a cutoff wavelength of 590 nm is used to isolate the painted droplets from the reflection of the LEDs, which enhances the contrast in the resulting images. Surface flow visualizations where the principal surface flow features have been marked are shown in Fig. 2 and demonstrate the flow similarity between interactions in the two facilities. Further details of the surface flow visualization technique can be found in similar studies (Baldwin et al. 2019; Arora et al. 2018). The images are normalized by respective incoming boundary layer thickness, which scales the surface flow fields by a factor of approximately four between the two experiments 
3.3 Steady PSP measurement To capture the mean pressure response with minimal temperature dependence, a binary FIB paint (ISSI product) is used (Peng et al. 2013). An RGB CCD camera (ISSI) with a Nikon f/1.2 50 mm lens records the emission of both platinum-porphyrin (temperature and pressure sensitive) and the reference (temperature sensitive only) luminophores, which are detected separately on the red and green channels of the RGB sensor, respectively. A 470 nm long-pass filter is used to filter the 400 nm excitation wavelength; the blue channel of the RGB images is not used. By ratioing each image’s red and green channels, the pressure field is corrected for temperature variation during the test. Pressure is calculated by taking the “ratio of ratios” with respect to a reference image acquired at known pressure conditions before starting the tests 
The final resolution of the images after splitting the red and green channels is 804 × 604 pixels, with a scale of approximately 26 pixels/mm. Images are acquired for the entire test run at 10 Hz, and the images corresponding to stable test conditions are averaged to produce a single intensity field. Typically 15 s of at-condition data are acquired, resulting in 150 images that are used for each average. In the pilot tunnel experiments, three static pressure ports located in the upstream flow region are used to validate the mean pressure in the freestream for each run. Limited comparison is available to the PSP response in the freestream; mean pressure has been extensively tested using arrays of static pressure transducers at the same test conditions, and the paint response validation is discussed in Sect. 4.1. The model temperature is monitored by two thermocouples and shows approximately 13◦C temperature change over the duration of the run and 3◦C change during the acquisition of the mean data (15 s). However, based on the quality of the fit to validation data from a previous test (Arora and Alvi 2016), no temperature corrections are introduced in the present analysis. The model plate used in the PSWT has 13 pressure taps within the interaction for in situ comparison with PSP. 
3.4 Unsteady PSP measurement A polymer-ceramic PSP with a highly porous base structure, which permits an oxygen diffusion time to the luminophore on the order of 100 μs, (Fang 2010) is applied to the plate surface. Three unsteady pressure transducers are each placed 44.5 mm from the fin leading edge at angles of 22°, 37°, and 57° from the incoming flow. The locations are identified from flow visualization as close to separation line, underneath vortical flow, and just upstream of reattachment, respectively. More details are provided in the subsequent discussion of unsteady pressure results in Sect. 4.3. 
A Phantom V2012 camera with a Nikon f/1.2 50mm and 12mm spacer is used with a 610 nm long-pass filter (Andover Optics) to isolate the PSP emission from reflected light from the excitation LEDs. The monochrome images are acquired at resolution of 768 × 480 pixels at 50,000 frames per second for 1 s. In order to correct for wind tunnel vibration, the wind-on images are registered to the initial reference image using a cross-correlation algorithm with accuracy up to 0.01 pixel shifts. The ratio of registered wind-on and reference images is then calculated, and masks are applied to remove pixels corresponding to the fin and unsteady pressure ports. In order to make post-processing less computationally intensive, the images are cropped and bicubic downsampling is applied to reduce the final size of each image to a resolution of 150 × 268 pixels and scale of 10.7 pixels/mm. 
3.5 Steady PSP calibration Prior to wind tunnel testing, pressure response and temperature response are independently calibrated using a small plate that is painted concurrently with the model plate to ensure applicability of the calibration. Pressure is adjusted in a sealed chamber with optical access for the RGB camera and LED illumination, while a Peltier heater affixed to the painted plate with embedded thermocouples permits temperature control of the plate. The calibration results, including a calibration fit provided by ISSI and the exponential fit derived from in situ calibration, reinforce the temperature insensitivity of the technique (Fig. 3). The paint was calibrated at pressures from 2 to 20 psia at 2 psi intervals and temperatures of 0, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C. The chevrons are colored by temperature, with the darkest symbol at 0 °C and the lightest at 25 °C, and confirm the low temperature sensitivity of the dual luminophore steady PSP. 
3.6 Unsteady PSP calibration In order to convert variations in intensity to pressure fluctuations without applying a temperature correction, the steady pressure distribution obtained using the temperature-compensated PSP is used as the known pressure to fit the unsteady intensity data from fast-response PSP. This allows the recorded unsteady intensity data to be calibrated to an unsteady pressure field, as depicted in Fig. 4. First, the steady pressure distribution is mapped to the same image space as the unsteady intensity ratios. Next, the relationship of intensity ratio and pressure is obtained by plotting the intensity ratio on the abscissa and pressure on the ordinate axis, as in Fig. 5. A quadratic function is fit for all data within a specified region of the interaction using a leastsquares estimate. These values for averaged unsteady PSP are included in the comparison to pressure tap data in Fig. 6 and agree well with this validation data. Some discrepancy between the interaction and freestream flows is observed, but it is not yet clear whether this effect is due to the impact of temperature or results from low signal-to-noise ratio. The unsteady pressure is simultaneously measured using three Kulite XCQ-062-5D pressure transducers mounted in the model plate flush with the test surface. The locations were identified from flow visualization as close to separation line, underneath vortical flow, and just upstream of reattachment, described in Sect. 3.4. The sensors are recorded at 200 kHz using a PXI-4462 A-D converter with built-in antialiasing filter that provides an alias-free bandwidth of DC to 80 kHz. Pressure acquisition is triggered by the camera recording, which is manually triggered by the operator once stable test conditions are reached. The differential pressure line is attached to the tunnel floor static pressure located on the wind tunnel side wall. A tare of the Kulites is performed during the wind-off image acquisition for each test run. A sample of time history of pressure (low-pass filtered below 8 kHz) measured by each Kulite and small “patches” of adjacent PSP (Fig. 11) shows the strong correlation between the techniques. A frequency response function is then estimated from each pair of signals to characterize the paint’s response; further discussion is in Sect. 4.3 
4 Results and discussion 
4.1 Measurements in SBLI using steady PSP The mean pressure field of the pilot tunnel measured using steady PSP is shown in Fig. 6a. The mean pressure field demonstrates an initial pressure increase near upstream influence line (UI), a pressure plateau between the separation line (SL) and inviscid shock line (IS), and maximum pressure near the fin, close to the reattachment line (RL). Two circular arcs are included to show where previous experiments (Arora et al. 2018) measured static pressure with traditional transducers, at r∕훿 = 4.5 and r∕훿 = 14.3. One array is within the inception zone, while the other lies under conically developed flow. Due to localized disruptions in the paint surface near the fin beyond r∕훿 = 12, steady PSP data downstream of r∕훿 = 12 is not reliable due to possible flow disruptions present under the paint surface and this limit is used to compare to pressure tap data in the conically developed region of the flow. Uncertainty in the steady pressure distribution is estimated as two standard deviations (2휎) from the mean, which is calculated from 15 s (150 images at 10 Hz) of PSP acquisition. The conical coordinates are based on initial surface oil flow in Arora et al. (2018), which place the VCO nearly 15훿 from the fin leading edge. This estimate for the VCO obtained from surface oil flow visualization relies solely on the upstream influence and separation line, which appear to converge at a greater distance than flow features downstream of separated flow. This has been demonstrated in simulations of swept compression ramp and fin-generated SBLI and hints at a deviation from quasiconical similarity in low Mach number interactions (Adler and Gaitonde 2019). Since the fin pressure distribution is also captured, a full view of the interaction for the interaction measured in the pilot tunnel is available (Fig. 7). A high pressure feature appears on the fin surface, and though accompanying surface oil flow experiments were not performed on the fin surface, it is conjectured that this is the response to the formation of a second compression due to a bow-shock-like shock ahead of separation near the fin leading edge. This is explored in more detail in the discussion of the unsteady PSP fields. However, within the fully developed region, outside the inception zone and downstream of separation, the boundary layer influence is negligible and the agreement in the pressure distribution using PSP between the two facilities is remarkably good. The discrepancy between “inner” and “outer” scaling within the conically developed region in swept SBLIs has been noted recently in simulations (Adler and Gaitonde 2019) and is here discussed from experimental pressure fields. A global comparison between the pressure fields measured in the pilot tunnel and PSWT is shown in Fig. 9, with color contours extracted from the PSWT and dashed line contours from the pilot tunnel. In dimensional coordinates, it is obvious that the flowfields are quite similar near the inviscid shock (solid line). However, the upstream influence region (where surface pressure increases from freestream (P∕P∞ = 1) to P∕P∞ = 1.6) is much larger in the PSWT pressure field than in the pilot tunnel. Additionally, the region of peak pressure (above P∕P∞ = 2) near the fin interface does not appear until farther downstream than in the pilot tunnel, indicating that the downstream location of peak pressure scales with boundary layer thickness as well. The flowfield model described by Vanstone et al. (2018) for swept SBLI describes the outer scaling of the interaction, which is strongly influenced by the parameters of the incoming boundary. The highly swept separation, where the crossflow velocity component dominates, appears to collapse using different scaling parameters, termed the inner scaling. Based on studies of swept ramp and sharp fin SBLI (Settles and Bogdonoff 1982; Settles Gary and Lu 1985), a correlation for the interaction inception length can be expressed as the following function: The conclusion from these correlation studies at Mach 3 studies is that an average value of a = 1∕3 produces general convergence of the extent of upstream influence, with broad scatter for fins (swept and unswept) and semicones in freestream Mach numbers of 2.25–4 (Zheltovodov and Knight 2011). This indicates that when the normal Mach number, Mn, is identical as in the two cases studied here, the inception length and boundary layer effect can be scaled by the Reynolds number using the boundary layer thickness as the pertinent length scale with a common exponent. However, the present data scale with a different exponent on the Reynolds number, a = 0.7. This is applied in Fig. 10, which scales the pressure distribution from the two wind tunnels with very good agreement throughout the pressure field. The deviation in scaling parameter from the accepted ℜ1 훿∕3 for freestream Mach numbers above 2 is possibly due to local effects of a bow-shock-like structure formed at the leading edge of the interaction, which is absent (or greatly reduced in influence) at higher Mach numbers. This was observed in a study with freestream Mach number of 1.8 and fin angle of 15°, with upstream influence obtained from surface oil flow visualization and pressure shifting farther upstream than predicted by the correlation with a = 1∕3 (Mukund et al. 2003). The deviation from established scaling may be a persistent feature of interactions with very high sweep that are close to shock detachment, but it is not possible to generalize from the limited available data. 
4.3 Unsteady pressure The unsteady pressure field shows strong fluctuations throughout the interaction. Three unsteady pressure sensors are installed underneath the interaction in the following configuration: K1 is downstream of separation, K2 is near the inviscid shock trace (underneath the recirculating vortex), and K3 is located near the impinging jet upstream of reattachment. Figure 11 shows the time history of the pressure from Kulites compared to the time history from PSP by locating a region of approximately 25 pixels just upstream of the Kulite in order to avoid paint response contamination downstream of the sensor. Although care is exercised to ensure the transducers are flush with the surrounding painted surface, it is important to recognize potential localized thermal contamination and local flow perturbations if the transducer is not perfectly flush. The Kulite XCQ-062- 5psid transducers fitted with B-screens have been reported to exhibit a flat frequency response up to 16 kHz (limited by the acoustic resonance of the sensor packaging) (Hurst and Olsen 2014) and here provide a “true” pressure, or input, for the PSP frequency response function up to the filtered frequency of 8 kHz. As observed in the time histories in Fig. 11, the PSP signal appears to track the temporal undulations in pressure as measured by the Kulites. There is a, however, a notable difference in the amplitude. To examine this further, the frequency response function (gain and phase) between the Kulite and averaged paint response are plotted from 0 to 8 kHz in Fig. 12. The frequency threshold for unsteady PSP is selected based on comparisons of PSP response and unsteady pressure transducers installed in the plate at three points in the interaction region. Coherence indicates the degree to which the paint is responding linearly with the pressure fluctuations measured by the transducer—because the transducer and PSP “patch” are not exactly collocated in the highly turbulent flow, it is expected that coherence is less than 1. However, values above 0.5 provide confidence in the PSP technique up to the determined cutoff frequency. There is a marked difference in the Kulite/PSP comparison in the K3 position, especially in the low frequency (0–1 kHz) coherence, that does not match the comparison observed in other locations. It is not possible to ascertain whether this difference in the signals is due to discrepancies in the physical response of the paint. It is likely that since this region of the flowfield is near reattachment, dynamics are dominated by mid-frequency pressure fluctuations, and the response within this low-frequency range is too low in amplitude to be accurately captured by PSP (Adler and Gaitonde 2018). The following analyses all consider the PSP field, wherein the time history of each pixel has been low-pass-filtered to 8 kHz, which provides a resolvable St훿 = 0.055. Although this does not capture all of the important mid-frequency content relating to Kelvin–Helmholtz and shear layer dynamics (0.01 < St< 0.1) (Adler and Gaitonde 2018) or high-frequency unsteadiness originating in the incoming boundary layer (St훿 ≈ 1), the spatially resolved pressure fields permit new observations of global, low- and limited mid-frequency dynamics. The relative energy of pressure fluctuations is visualized by the root-mean-square pressure in Fig. 13, which is nondimensionalized by the freestream pressure (P∞) obtained from the steady pressure distribution. The footprint of the interaction is clearly visible by the sharp increase over the freestream pressure fluctuations at the upstream influence line. Peak rms levels are observed near the leading edge of the fin, both on the face of the fin and the plate surface. The amplitude of pressure fluctuations decreases as the interaction grows in size and reaches a steady value in the conically developed region of the flow. The first peak lies between the upstream influence and separation lines and is related to the separation shock foot motion. The strong unsteadiness upstream of the fin is similar to the unsteadiness in a 2-D separated SBLI. Several instantaneous snapshots of the 3-D pressure distribution on the fin and surface beneath the interaction are shown in Fig. 14. The selected sequence shows every 4th image, so that the time step between pressure fields is 80μs. Although the instantaneous images are shown at a time step smaller than the upper limit of the filtered frequency response to 8 kHz (훥tfilter = 125μs), motion of low-frequency structures is visible within the pressure field. A black contour line is added to P�∕P∞ = 0.01 to help identify highpressure structures present in the field. Colored arrows are added to identify features on the fin and plate surface and are discussed below. The sequence begins (Fig. 14a) with high pressure upstream of the fin leading edge observable on the plate surface (yellow arrow) and traces of high pressure on the fin surface (white arrow). This corresponds to the farthest upstream extent of the “quasi-2-D” SBLI present at the fin leading edge. Pressure near reattachment (magenta arrow) is positive in this frame, and although does not appear as a discrete moving pressure structure in the flowfield, it consistently correlates with high pressure immediately upstream of the fin leading edge. In the next frame (Fig. 14b), the high pressure near the fin leading edge (yellow arrow) appears to shift toward the interaction, and low-pressure zone at the fin leading edge grows. The high-pressure structure moves farther away from the fin leading edge in Fig. 14c on both the plate (yellow arrow) and fin surface (white arrow). The high-pressure structure tracked with the yellow arrow splits into two in Fig. 14d, where the downstream feature convecting away from the fin is marked by a gray arrow. Low pressure upstream of the fin leading edge is at a maximum from the observed frames, indicating downstream limit of the shock motion, nearly opposite to the region of high pressure marked by a yellow arrow in Fig. 14a. The next frame (Fig. 14e) shows a weakening of the high pressure on the fin (white arrow) and fast convection of flow from the swept interaction (gray arrow). The high-pressure structure marked with the yellow arrow remains relatively stagnant. Pressure near reattachment (magenta arrow) is low and reverses the pattern evident near reattachment observed in the first frame (Fig. 14a). The final frame (Fig. 14f) demonstrates pressure increasing on the plate upstream of the fin leading edge and weak pressure signature on the fin surface that is reminiscent of the first frame. The high-pressure structures that were upstream of the fin (yellow and gray arrows) convect quickly away once out of the vicinity of the fin leading edge. The presence of high-amplitude pressure structures near the fin leading edge is immediately obvious, and the pressure signature on the fin surface shows the presence of a curved structure with alternating high and low pressure, which is most evident in Fig. 14d. This is evidence of a sweeping shock produced by the separation upstream of the fin leading edge, similar to a bow shock. In addition to the oblique shock produced by the freestream flow deflecting in response to the fin, unsteadiness within the interaction is influenced by convecting flow features from the separation near the fin edge within the boundary layer. 
5 Conclusions Spatially resolved steady and unsteady surface pressure fields in swept SBLI are obtained using pressure-sensitive paint. The mean pressure distribution is obtained using an in situ pressure calibration and validated against pressure tap arrays within the interaction. In situ calibration can correct for changes in PSP luminophore response, which decay at different rates and affect the binary FIB calibration over successive wind tunnel runs. The key contribution of the current work is establishing a procedure for anchoring unsteady PSP results to static pressure distribution measured with temperature-corrected steady PSP. Once calibrated, the unsteady PSP is able to capture the unsteady pressure field up to at least 8 kHz (St훿 = 0.055). Future efforts to characterize the response can enable frequency-dependent calibration of the paint response and improved quantitative description of the pressure fields. Additionally, the PSP analysis can be further improved using modal analysis techniques in order to reduce noise (Sugioka et al. 2019) and isolate key physics within the unsteady data. The pressure fields between two facilities with fivefold difference in boundary layer height can be assimilated by scaling by 훿∕ℜa 훿, where a = 0.7 instead of the widely validated scaling of a = 1∕3. The scaling of upstream influence measured in the present experiments deviates from correlations developed for higher Mach numbers (M > 2.5), possibly due to the local effect of a bow-shock-like structure near the fin leading edge. Further investigation into the scaling for interactions with high sweep angle is necessary to determine the broader applicability of the present scaling law to low supersonic Mach numbers, since distinct physics in local recirculating flow near the shock generator is implicated Transonic Turbine Vane EndwallFilm Cooling Using the PressureSensitive Paint MeasurementTechnique 

Abstract
This work focuses on the parametric study of film cooling effectiveness on the turbine vaneendwall under various flow conditions. The experiments were performed in a five-vaneannular sector cascade facility in a blowdown wind tunnel. The controlled exit isentropicMach numbers were 0.7, 0.9, and 1.0, from high subsonic to transonic conditions. The freestream turbulence intensity is estimated to be 12%. Three coolant-to-mainstream mass flowratios (MFR) in the range 0.75%, 1.0%, and 1.25% are studied. N2, CO2, and Argon/SF6mixture were used to investigate the effects of density ratio (DR), ranging from 1.0, 1.5,to 2.0. There are eight cylindrical holes on the endwall inside the passage. The pressuresensitive paint (PSP) technique was used to capture the endwall pressure distribution forshock wave visualization and obtain the detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions.Both the high-fidelity effectiveness contour and the laterally (spanwise) averaged effectiveness were measured to quantify the parametric effect. This study will provide the gas turbinedesigner more insight on how the endwall film cooling effectiveness varies with differentcooling flow conditions including shock wave through the endwall crossflow passage 

Introduction
Film cooling is one of the effective approaches to protect the gasturbine components from being damaged by the high-temperaturemainstream inside the engine during operation. This protection isespecially important on the first stage vane since it has to withstandthe highest heat load from the combustor exit. The film cooling onthe endwall region of the first stage vane is, therefore, a challengingtask for the gas turbine designers due to the nature of the complicated flow field from the strong pressure gradient in the endwallpassage, and the secondary flows including the horseshoe vortices,passage, and corner vortices [1]. The complicated interactionbetween the coolant and the mainstream can make the coolant coverage on the endwall to deviate from the desired scenario.Even not considering the effect of leakage flow from the interfacebetween the combustor and vane, many studies about the possibleparameters affecting the film cooling performance on turbineendwall are available in the open literature [2–9]. However, thereare relatively few investigations focusing on the endwall heat transfer/film cooling under transonic conditions. Although there areseveral papers [10–15] on the film cooling studies under transonicflow conditions conducted on simplified geometries or even thecascade, the conclusions from these studies contradict each otheras the Mach number or the oblique shock wave is found to haveeither a positive/negative effect or no measurable effect on thefilm effectiveness. Among the limited endwall film coolingstudies under transonic flow conditions, Harasgama and Burton[16] performed a heat transfer experiment on the outer endwall of the nozzle guide vane with discrete holes film cooling under an exitMach number of 0.93. They found that placing the cooling holealong an iso-Mach line is a very effective approach to cool thevane endwall. In terms of the Nusselt number on the endwall,there is a reduction up to 75% near the hole exit due to filmcooling; around 50% reduction in most of the other areas with thecoolant-to-mainstream mass flow ratio less than 1.45%. Giel et al.[17] used the steady-state liquid crystal to study blade endwallheat transfer for exit isentropic Mach numbers of 1.0 and 1.3 in alinear cascade. Their results indicate that the shock in the supersoniccase breaks up the smooth Stanton number distribution seen in thesonic case. Also, the Stanton number for the sonic case is actually40–60% higher than the supersonic case. Nicklas [18] investigatedthe heat transfer and film cooling in a linear cascade under exit isentropic Mach numbers of 1.0 and 1.2 using an infrared camera. Hisresults about the influence of the Mach number show an interestingphenomenon. For the downstream of the throat area, there is a 20%heat transfer coefficient decrease in the supersonic case comparedwith the sonic case despite the higher local Mach number in thesupersonic case. He attributed the heat transfer reduction to theeffect of the shock in the throat to the endwall boundary layer,the shock leads to a fast increase of the endwall boundary layeror even separation. Later works from Jonsson et al. [19] and Salvadori et al. [20] studied the heat transfer/film cooling under an outletisentropic Mach number of 0.88. Nonetheless, similar to the aforementioned research, there is no clear clue how the film coolingeffectiveness on the endwall will change under the different transonic conditions. The interaction between the film and the pressuregradient in the endwall is already very complicated, not to mentionif the shock wave is present. Specifically, whether the shock waveaffects the film cooling on the endwall in a similar fashion as the flatplate test remains a question.Therefore, this study experimentally investigates endwall filmcooling by systematically varying coolant-to-mainstream massflow ratios (MFR) and density ratio (DR), with the mainstream conditions from high subsonic to transonic at a given endwall filmcooling design. The present work will help the gas turbine designerto have more understanding of the coolant behavior on the endwallunder the transonic flow conditions. 
Experimental Setup and Method
Five-Vane Annular Sector Cascade. The flow loop of the testrig is shown in Fig. 1(a). As shown in Fig. 1(b), the metal cascadeand the two reinforcement bars for the windows are made by eitherthe selective laser sintering process or aluminum machining. Thetest vane is an aluminum machined piece, while the endwall ismade from a stiff resin material called Somos® PerFORM usingthe stereolithography process. The test vane is of a threedimensional design with a solidity around 0.5 and an aspect ratioof around 0.7. The endwall is contoured to have the passage areacontraction before the leading edge (LE) plane and a step expansionafter the trailing edge (TE) plane, respectively. The current testsection has a wide Plexiglas window coverage extended toaround 1.6Cax both upstream and downstream of the centervane’s leading and trailing edge planes. The three-window designis intended to divide the windows into smaller pieces to reducethe equivalent force that each window has to sustain during thehigh-speed flow. Also, reinforcement bars are installed to provideadditional coverage between the window interfaces. A blowdownfacility is used as the source of the mainstream. It consists of a highpressure compressor, a dryer, and a reservoir. An electronic flowcontrol valve is used to control the mainstream velocity by monitoring and adjusting the pressure in the upstream of the flow loop.The mainstream condition during the tests was continuouslymonitored using the Pitot-Static probes instrumented at 3.81Caxupstream and 0.75Cax downstream of the vanes leading and trailingedge planes, respectively. The probe readings from the downstreamwere used to define the nominal flow condition (exit Mach number) as shown in Fig. 2(a). A turbulence grid was used to create an estimated turbulence intensity of 12% [21] and an integral length scaleof 1.5 cm on the vanes’ LE plane. The grid is located at 7.61Caxupstream of the vanes’ LE plane. It has an equivalent bar widthof 1.43 cm and 54% porosity. The light-emitting device (LED)light and charge-coupled device (CCD) camera are arranged atboth upstream and downstream of the test section for data capturingunder different views 
Film Cooling System. There are two cooling hole rows on theendwall inside the passage, five cylindrical holes at the first row, and three cylindrical holes at the second row as shown in Fig. 2(b).Since the typical upstream portion of the endwall is protected by theinjection from the slot between the combustor and the vane, thecurrent two-row holes are intended to protect the endwall withinthe passage only. It is noted that the hole close to the pressureside at the second row is actually underneath the vanes’ TE dueto the special vane geometry. The diameter (d) of the coolinghole is around 0.14 cm. The injection angle is around 29-deg and17-deg for the first and second row, respectively. They are of different lengths and exit areas due to the curvature of the endwall. Asingle plenum is used to supply the coolant to all the endwallcooling holes. A metal screen and a honeycomb are installedinside the plenum to make sure the coolant pressure inside theplenum is uniform. The uniformity is further confirmed with twopressure taps instrumented on both sides of the plenum walls. Dryair from the compressor loop or the foreign gas cylinders were usedas the coolant. Three different kinds of foreign gas including N2(DR = 0.97 ≈ 1.0), CO2 (DR = 1.52 ≈ 1.5), and Argon/SF6mixture (DR = 1.93 ≈ 2.0) were used. The flowrate of the coolantis controlled using a rotameter, in which the reading is correctedusing the pressure at the rotameter exit 
Experimental Method. The conduction-free pressure-sensitivepaint (PSP) technique is used to capture the film cooling effectiveness on the endwall. PSP is a mixture of luminescent moleculesand oxygen permeable binder. The luminescent molecules in thepaint can be excited by using the light of a specific wavelength(400 nm) to illuminate the painted surface. The correspondingemission intensity from the painted surface is of a longerwavelength (650 nm). It can be recorded by the monochromescientific grade CCD camera (The Cooke Corporation, SensiCam,with 320 × 240 resolution, 16-bit dynamic range). A long-passfilter is attached to the camera to prevent the excitation lightfrom being captured.The PSP’s emission intensity is inversely proportional to theoxygen concentration of the painted surface (oxygen quenching).So, a proper calibration to quantify the variation of the emissionintensity to the oxygen partial pressure on the painted surface isneeded. A typical calibration can be realized using a pressurecontrolled chamber with optical access and a test coupon coatedwith PSP. The test coupon is a small strip of copper sprayedwith black paint, painted 4–5 layers (30–40 µm thickness perlayer) of PSP, and then placed in the chamber. The coupon hasone T-type thermocouple embedded and is attached to a heatingmat. During the calibration, the PSP-coated coupon, LED, andthe camera were arranged to a similar scenario as the real test.The emission intensity variation within the expected experimentpressure range was captured correspondingly. The oxygen partialpressure adjacent to the painted surface is found to be correlatewith the surface emission intensity by a power fitting curve asshown in Fig. 3. In addition, the sensitivity of PSP emission intensity to surface temperature and view angle are described inRef. [9].The center endwall was painted with PSP using an airbrush bythe same procedures as described in calibration. The area in thevicinity of the center endwall including the test vane and the neighbor vanes are painted black to reduce stray reflection. Four imagesets are required to determine the film cooling effectiveness for agiven flow condition. They are the black image, the referenceimage, the foreign gas injection image, and the air injectionimage. The black image set (Ib) is used to eliminate the backgroundnoise from the camera sensor. The reference image set (Iref) is theintensity taken with LED switched on but without flow(wind-off). Two wind-on image sets including the air injectioncase (Iair) and the oxygen-free foreign gas injection case (Ifg) aretaken under the same coolant flowrate with mainstream presents.The corresponding oxygen partial pressures are PO2,air and PO2,fg .One hundred images were recorded in each image set to averageout the measurement noise. 
Test Conditions
To systematically study the parametric effect of varying MFR,DR, and the exit Ma on the endwall film cooling, 33 sets of experiments were performed. Five different MFRs from 0.5% to 1.5%were conducted at the lowest exit Ma case to capture the generaltrend of the MFR effect on this particular endwall film coolingdesign. Three different MFRs from 0.75% to 1.25% were later conducted at higher exit Ma cases. For all the MFR cases studied, DR isvaried from 1.0 to 2.0. The summary of the test matrix is shown inTable 1.Experimental UncertaintyThe fluctuation of mainstream velocity (±3%) and the fluctuationof coolant flowrate (±2%) will contribute to the uncertainty of themeasurement in this experiment. However, the fluctuation of thePSP emission intensity value captured by the camera is consideredthe dominant uncertainty source. By the method proposed by Kline and McClintock [23] based on a 95% confidence level, theuncertainties of film cooling effectiveness deduced from the calibration curve at η = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 are 15%, 3.9%, 1.7%, and0.7%, respectively, in the present study. The reported uncertaintyrefers to the local values as it is estimated on the raw data basedon the corresponding value of each pixel in the data capturing region.Results and DiscussionPressure and Isentropic Mach Number Distribution. Thestatic pressure distributions on the endwall under different mainstream conditions are shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding isentropicMach number is calculated using the total pressure measured from the inlet pitot-static probe. The individual color bar range is used fordifferent exit Ma cases to find the local variation of the pressure/Maon the endwall. The line (no data) within the passage on the contouris the junction line between the data captured from the upstreamview and downstream view. This line will be included in all the following contour plots. The static pressure, in general, is the highestat around the vane’s LE and then gradually decreases toward theTE. The corresponding isentropic Ma is increasing from LE toTE in the passage. The pressure on the pressure side of thepassage is higher than the one on the suction side, this pressure difference is the source of the crossflow inside the passage and canaffect the coolant distribution. Since the downstream pressure monitoring point (Pitot-Static Probe) is actually out of the passage (flowdecelerates due to further channel expansion) as shown in Fig. 2(a),the isentropic Ma on the endwall especially at the downstream ofthe passage is found to be consistently higher than the nominalflow condition. For exit Ma = 0.9 and 1.0 case, there is a narrowsector-shaped static pressure recovery band (downstream of thedotted line in the close-up dashed box) that starts at right upstreamof the second cooling hole row, which is not observed in lowest exitMa cases. This abrupt Ma change is also revealed in Fig. 4(c). Thiscould be the oblique shock wave originating from the neighborvanes’ TE, as its location is considered similar to the previousstudy [24] based on the same vane’s geometry. However, whetherthe shock wave might affect the endwall film cooling or not willbe discussed in the Mach number effect.Blowing Ratio and Momentum Flux Ratio. For all the MFRsand DRs in this study, the row-averaged blowing ratio and the corresponding momentum flux ratio are calculated. A constant discharge coefficient is first assumed for all the cooling holes atthe first and second rows. With the plenum pressure measuredby the pressure tap, the endwall static pressure and isentropic Ma distribution measured by PSP, the discharge coefficient canbe calculated as 
The local coolant velocity can thus be obtained to calculate thetrue coolant mass flux. The row-averaged blowing ratio andmomentum flux ratio are shown in Table 2.As the coolant from the first and second cooling hole rows aresupplied by a single plenum, it is expected that there will be a relatively small amount of film that comes out from the first row compared with the second row due to the endwall static pressuredistribution. However, since the mainstream mass flux at thesecond row is higher than at the first row, the averaged blowingratio on the second row is found to be lower than the first row formost of the test conditions. 
Mass Flow Ratio Effect. 
DR = 1.5 at exit Ma = 0.7 cases areselected to demonstrate the MFR effect. As shown in Fig. 5,coolant turning can be found for both cooling hole rows as thetrace directions do not exactly follow the hole exit directions. TheMFR effect on the first and second cooling hole row is different.Overall, the current two-row design seems to provide sufficientcoolant protection for the majority of the current endwall passage.The film coverage from the first row demonstrates an increasingthen a decreasing trend when the MFR increases from 0.5% to1.5%. Best film coverage is found to be when MFR = 0.75%.When the MFR increases beyond this point, the shrinking of thecoolant trace right at the downstream edge of the cooling hole indicates the onset of coolant lift-off. Also, it is found that the coolantlift-off does not uniformly happen in every hole at the first row. Butthe surface static pressure does not demonstrate a similar nonuniformity at the vicinity of the first row. One potential reasoncould be that non-uniformity is actually the result of the timeaveraged unsteadiness of the film due to mainstream turbulence.This will require further investigation of the film’s unsteady behavior. On the other hand, the film coverage from the second rowdemonstrates an increasing trend when the MFR increases to1.0% but then gradually levels off for even higher MFR. This behavior difference between cooling hole rows can be attributed to threereasons. First, at the location of the first row, the suction side leg ofhorseshoe vortices from the vane’s LE and the corner vortex fromthe vane’s pressure side are still very close to the surface. So, thefilm from the first row is very susceptible to lift-off. Second, thesmaller surface angle of the second row can make the coolinghole performance less sensitive to coolant lift-off since the coolant’svertical (wall-normal) momentum is reduced compared with thecounterpart of the steeper surface angle (first row). Third, the longer cooling hole length and slightly larger cooling hole exit areadue to the shallow surface angle can lead to a more uniform exitvelocity profile where it is beneficial to have higher effectiveness.Besides, the coolant deflection due to the mainstream is reducedwhen MFR increases (higher coolant momentum). But this behavioris not prominent for trace from the second row which implies thestrong mainstream still dominates the local flow field.Figure 6 shows the laterally averaged effectiveness when DR =1.5 at exit Ma = 0.7. It is worthy to mention that in this study, thenoise level on the region upstream of the first row is not always negligible and does not correlate to the variation of any parameter inthis study. While this noise level varies from run to run, theauthors confirmed that it does not affect the results (magnitude)for the region covered with film traces (X/Cax ≥ 0.3). To preventconfusion in interpreting this noise as the true effectiveness, theupstream of the first row (X/Cax < 0.3) is excluded from all thelateral averaged effectiveness plots in this study. For the upstreamregion (X/Cax < 0.68) which the coolant only comes from the firstrow, it is clear that MFR = 0.75% case has the highest averagedeffectiveness. For higher MFR, the decreasing trend is alsovisible. For the downstream region (X/Cax ≥ 0.68), since the filmeffectiveness contributed by the second row is dominant, an increasing trend then being leveled off averaged effectiveness trend can bedetected similar to the observation in the contour plots. There aresome film (coolant) carryover even after the trailing edge plane,but the data there suffer from the reflection due to the step expansion, so the data after X/Cax > 1.1 are not included in this study.Density Ratio Effect. DR = 1.0 and 2.0 at exit Ma = 0.9 casesare selected to demonstrate the DR effect as shown in Fig. 7. Itshould be noted that, for a given cooling hole design under afixed endwall pressure distribution, the required differential pressure to deliver a given amount of coolant decreases when thecoolant density increases. This implies that the heavier coolant actually is less likely to being ejected from the holes where the mainstream static pressure is high. This is typically the case when thecoolant flowrate is low (so is the corresponding blowing ratio). Ata given coolant flowrate, the heavier coolant also possesses lowermomentum. This is great for better lateral coolant spreading, butthe correspondingly low streamwise momentum can lead to insufficient film coverage in the streamwise direction. However, in thisparticular endwall cooling design, a positive DR effect is observedwhen MFR is as low as 0.75%. This implies that the momentum ofthe heavier coolant is sufficient enough to have a satisfactorystreamwise film coverage. On the other hand, it is found that thewide coolant trace when DR = 2.0 does not demonstrate sufficientoverlapping, leaving the portion between holes unprotected. This could be easily improved by using the shaped hole in the firstrow. The short coolant traces from the second row when DR =2.0 simply implies that the low coolant momentum is inadequateto form a proper film coverage. When MFR increases to 1.0%,the film coverage from the first row reduces but the one from thesecond row enhances. The momentum of the heavier coolant islower compared with the lighter coolant, which is a great advantagein terms of having film stay adhered to the surface instead of lift-off.When MFR is further increased to 1.25%, the coolant lift-off isinevitable particularly for the film from the first row since thecoolant traces are shrinking for both DRs. Nevertheless, a widertrace is still observed when DR = 2.0 compared with DR = 1.0, indicating a positive DR effect.Figure 8 shows the laterally averaged effectiveness for DR = 1.0and 2.0 at exit Ma = 0.9. The trend of averaged effectiveness variation is found to be consistent with the contour plots. The behaviorof the DR effect on the averaged effectiveness from the first rowand second row is found to be the same. This reiterates the fact thatwhile the DR effect can be negative or marginal for the lowcoolant flowrate, within the tested MFR range, a positive DR effectfor the current endwall cooling design can be expected since thecoolant has sufficient momentum (flowrate is relatively high).Mach Number Effect. The performance of the different coolinghole rows is supposed to vary based on the local endwall surface pressure (subjected to the Ma). This will cause the coolant split (redistribution) and affect the film distribution between two rows. So, theobserved coolant behaviors when varying the Ma are considered ascombined characteristics instead of purely from flow compressibility. Three different MFRs when DR = 1.0 and 2.0 casesare selected to examine the Ma effect as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. Thefilm from the first row and second row shows different Ma effects. Inaddition, different MFRs are found to demonstrate different Maeffects as well. For the film from the first row, it is found that thefilm coverage in general increases with the increase of the exit Ma.As the exit Ma increases, the mainstream velocity at the regionnear the first row also increases. This higher mainstream velocityresults in a thinner boundary layer around the first row. The corresponding higher near-wall velocity facilitates the film bendingtoward the wall, relieves the coolant lift-off, and eventually leadsto better film coverage. The positive Ma effect on the film effectiveness is more prominent when the coolant flowrate is high. This phenomenon is consistent with the finding reported by Shiau et al. [24]and Saumweber and Schulz [25]. For the film from the second row,the film coverage variations when exit Ma increases are found to berelated to the corresponding MFR. When the MFR = 0.75%, theeffectiveness is found to decrease significantly when exit Maincreases. But when MFR = 1.25%, the film coverage at exit Ma =1.0 outperforms the Ma = 0.9 case. From Fig. 4(a), when exit Ma = 1.0, the local static pressure rises when flow across the shock wave is observed (narrow high-pressure band upstream of the secondrow). According to Ligrani et al. [13], compared with the casewithout the shock present, the flow deflection occurs across theshock can locally reduce the effective blowing ratio and forcelarger film concentration near the surface. From Figs. 9 and 10, thelarger film concentration near the surface is indeed observed as thefilm for higher exit Ma seems to diffuse and fills the spacingbetween the holes compared with the lowest exit Ma. In addition,as the traces from the second row do not seem to be affected significantly by the endwall flow field (passage vortex), the argument fromLigrani et al. [13] seems to be applicable to the scenario in the presentstudy as well. For low MFR (e.g., 0.75%), the shock reduces theeffective blowing ratio by increasing themainstream local static pressure, which leads to insufficient coolant momentum and thereforepoor film coverage. On the other hand, for the higher MFR (e.g.,1.25%), the effective blowing ratio reduction by increasing the mainstream local static pressure and deflecting the jet could indeedachieve improved effectiveness by relieving the coolant lift-off tendency. However, this might also lead to higher effectiveness in thevicinity of the hole as mentioned earlier, but the film is incapableto propagate much in the streamwise direction.Figures 11 and 12 show the laterally averaged effectiveness forDR = 1.0 and 2.0 at different exit Ma, respectively. In general, the averaged effectiveness is increasing when exit Ma increasesfor X/Cax < 0.68; for X/Cax ≥ 0.68, a decreasing then increasingeffectiveness trend is observed when exit Ma increases. It is alsofound that exit Ma = 0.7 cases have the highest averaged effectiveness for X/Cax ≥ 0.68, but this advantage is diminishing when theMFR increases since the coolant lift-off is weakened by the shockwave when MFR is high 
Matching the Momentum Flux Ratio. 
As the coolant momentum dominates the film behavior, the momentum flux ratio is beingconsidered as the quantity to combine the blowing ratio and density ratio for film performance comparison, especially in the flat platestudy. Based on the row-averaged momentum flux ratio inTable 2, selective cases with the matching momentum flux ratioare compared to evaluate if it can portray the resulting effectswhen the MFR, DR, and exit Ma are varying.For the first row, only two cases when exit Ma = 0.7 have thematching I ≈ 2.8 as shown in Fig. 13(a). It is found that while thefilm distribution seems similar, the traces in higher DR cases are relatively diffused. For the second row, eight cases for exit Ma rangingfrom low to high are having the matching I ≈ 0.3 as shown inFig. 13(b). It is found that except for the cases when exit Ma =0.9, the coolant traces in higher DR cases are wider which meansstronger lateral spreading. In other words, with the same momentumflux ratio, different DR results in different coolant diffusion scenarios. Moreover, it is found that the coolant spreading from the secondrow for high exit Ma is more prominent than the low Ma cases,which is considered due to the shock as discussed earlier. Therefore,it is reasonable to conclude the momentum flux ratio effect is unableto properly describe the Mach number and the DR effects observedin this study 
Area-Averaged Effectiveness. 
The area-averaged effectivenesson the endwall for all the test cases in this study is shown inFig. 14. The endwall is divided into two zones, Zone 1 is fromthe upstream edge of the first row to the upstream edge of the second row; Zone 2 is the region at the downstream of Zone 1.Since there is no coolant coverage upstream of the first row,those areas have been excluded from Zone 1, which means thearea-averaged value will be inherently higher than the laterallyaveraged one. For Zone 1, MFR = 0.75% seems to be anoptimum flowrate for exit Ma = 0.7, when exit Ma increases, adecreasing trend on effectiveness when MFR increases is observedfor exit Ma = 0.9, but the trend becomes to decrease then increasesfor exit Ma = 1.0. For Zone 2, an increasing than being level off oneffectiveness is observed for exit Ma = 0.7, but the trend becomesto increase then decrease for higher exit Ma. The trend for Zone 1and Zone 2 is found to be the opposite when just comparing theresults at MFR = 0.75%, 1.0%, and 1.25%. This could be attributed to the single plenum design as the film coverage variationwhen MFR changes is shifting between the coolant contributedfrom the first and second row.
Conclusions
A parametric study on the effect of MFR, DR, and exit Ma on theendwall film cooling effectiveness measurements was performed ona five-vane annular sector cascade. The film cooling performanceunder different conditions is compared and discussed with regardto detailed film cooling effectiveness contours, laterally averaged,as well as the area-averaged effectiveness. The key highlights ofthe presented study are as below:(1) For this particular endwall film cooling design, increasingMFR has an increasing then a decreasing effect on the filmeffectiveness from the first row; for the film from thesecond row, an increasing then leveled off trend on thefilm effectiveness is observed.(2) Within the tested MFR ranges, a positive DR effect on thefilm effectiveness is observed for both the first and secondrows on the present endwall cooling design.(3) The Ma effect is positive for the coolant from the first row,for the coolant from the second row, the Ma effect dependson the MFR. Negative Ma effect is observed when MFR islow and the positive effect is demonstrated when MFRincreases. Due to the cooling hole location, the film fromthe second row does not seem to be affected by theendwall flow field, so the effect of the shock wave on thefilm is similar to the flat plate test. Because of the plenumdesign, in addition to the flow compressibility, the Maeffect in this study includes the impact from the coolant split.(4) The momentum flux ratio is unable to correlate the film behavior for different flow conditions (varying MFR, DR, exitMa) as the case in the flat plate test.(5) The variation trend of area-averaged effectiveness on Zone 1and Zone 2 at different exit Ma is different. Especially forexit Ma = 0.9 and 1.0, a reversed trend is observed forZone 1 and Zone 2. Validation of a NumericalQuasi-One-Dimensional Modelfor Wave Rotor Turbines WithCurved Channels 

Abstract
A wave rotor is a shock-driven pressure exchange device that, while relatively rarelystudied or indeed, employed, offers significant potential efficiency gains in a variety ofapplications including refrigeration and gas turbine topping cycles. This paper introduces a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) wave action model implemented in MATLAB for thecomputation of the unsteady flow field and performance characteristics of wave rotors ofstraight or cambered channel profiles. The purpose here is to introduce and validate arapid but reliable method of modeling the performance of a power-generating wave rotorwhere little such insight exists in open literature. The model numerically solves the laminar one-dimensional (1D) Navier–Stokes equations using a two-step Richtmyer time variation diminishing (TVD) scheme with minmod flux limiter. Additional source termsaccount for viscous losses, wall heat transfer, flow leakage between rotor and stator endplates as well as torque generation through momentum change. Model validation wasconducted in two steps. First of all, unsteady and steady predictive capabilities weretested on three-port pressure divider rotors from open literature. The results show thatboth steady port flow conditions as well as the wave action within the rotor can be predicted with good agreement. Further validation was done on an in-house developed andexperimentally tested four-port, three-cycle, throughflow microwave rotor turbine featuring symmetrically cambered passage walls aimed at delivering approximately 500 W ofshaft power. The numerical results depict trends for pressure ratio, shaft power, and outlet temperature reasonably well. However, the results also highlight the need to accurately measure leakage gaps when the machine is running in thermal equilibrium. 

Introduction
Over the past decades, numerous research studies have beendedicated toward the investigation of dynamic pressure exchangemachinery, such as wave rotors. These devices use the energy carried in moving shock waves to transfer energy from one stream offluid to another without the need to incorporate additionalmechanical parts. This advantage, in combination with relativelylarge pressure ratio gains through shock wave compression and ahigh efficiency associated with this process, renders wave actiondevices an attractive technology for power generation.Opposed to crypto-steady flow devices, such as turbomachinery, wave rotors are inherently unsteady flow devices, whereshock and expansion waves travel along discrete channelsarranged around the circumference of a cylindrical drum. To eachside of the spinning rotor, there are stator endplates containingport openings, as shown in Fig. 1. Exposing the rotor channelsperiodically to the ports then triggers shock and expansion waves.The application range for wave rotors outlined by the literatureis diverse. The bulk of early studies focused on pressure exchangers with straight passage profiles for gas turbine topping cycles[1–8] and supercharging devices for internal combustion engines[9–16]. In recent years, the application to refrigeration cycles[17–19] and pressure-gain combustors [20–22] has come into thefocus of consideration.In comparison, little amount of attention has been given towave turbines with cambered passage walls aimed at acting bothas pressure exchangers while producing shaft power through momentum change of the flow [23–27]. Documentation of theseendeavors is unfortunately fragmentary. The best documented andmost successful example of a wave rotor engine was done byPearson [23,24] at the University of Bath. Initial tests were conducted on a single cycle, through-flow wave rotor with helicalpassage shape leading to a power output of around 26 kW at arotational speed of 18,000 rpm. Further research was suspendedafter the engine was destroyed due to overspeeding. Furtherexperiments by General Electric and General Power Corporationyielded insufficient shaft power generation and were not furtherpursued [25,26] 
One limitation of early efforts on wave rotor design was partially due to a lack in computational power rendering performanceestimation time consuming (in particular when done by hand calculations) and often inaccurate. To mitigate this and to accuratelycompute unsteady wave action in the rotor channels and steadyconditions in the ports as well as wave rotor performance parameters, one-dimensional (1D) codes have established themselves asswift and reliable tools. This has been pursued by a number ofinstitutions, ranging from the Naval Postgraduate School [28–32],University of Tokyo [6,33,34], ONERA [6,35,36], Michigan StateUniversity [37], NASA Glenn Research Center [38–42] as well asXiamen University/Beihang University [43,44] most recently.While most of the mentioned studies deal with straight channels, there is merely one study that incorporates passage curvaturein a one-dimensional environment, albeit at reduced order througha passage-averaged description. This was conducted at NASAGlenn Research Center by Welch and Paxson [42] and comparedport axial and tangential velocities as well as predicted power output to a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)simulation. However, no comparison with experimental data wasdone.Against this background, this paper aims at addressing this gapby introducing a one-dimensional model that allows a reliable andcost effective insight into the performance of wave rotors withstraight and arbitrarily shaped camber. To the authors’ knowledge,this paper will present, for the first time, a quasi-one-dimensional(Q1D) model that allows direct computation of torque output forcambered wave rotor channels without the need for further modelreduction. It is also the first time such a model has been comparedto experiments. Conventional 1D models for turbines and compressors employ either a map-based approach that requires a prioriexperimental data in the form of mass flow rate, efficiency, andpressure ratio [45] or model the rotor wheel through an adiabaticpressure loss that is calibrated over the anticipated flow rangeagainst experimental data [46]. The proposed model, however,differs to that approach as directly models the unsteady waveaction dynamics within the rotor while accounting for finite passage opening, friction, leakage, and inviscid forces.The structure of the paper is thus as follows: first, the governingequations and model source terms for viscous and inviscid forces,flow leakage, and wall heat transfer are introduced; second, steadyand unsteady validation of the code is done based on experimentaldata from the open literature on pressure dividers done by Kentfield [47] and NASA [48]. Further validation of the model isachieved through experimental data from a wave rotor turbineexperiment performed in the gas stand at the University of Bath.The wave rotor turbine features a symmetrical, arc-shaped passage design that was designed to produce a power output of up to500 W.Simulation Model
The model was implemented in MATLAB R2017 and follows asingle wave rotor passage of constant cross section as it passesports along the circumference. It consists of numerical routines tosolve the one-dimensional conservation equations accounting forchannel curvature for shaft power extraction, heat transferbetween fluid and rotor walls, flow leakage in the axial clearancebetween stator and rotor, as well as gradual passage openingeffects. The code can be applied to both through-flow and reverseflow wave rotor applications.Finally, the user has the option of defining the gas compositionfor the operating medium. Throughout this study, this is assumedto be air, composed of 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen.For the derivation of the model, a number of assumptions aremade; first of all, in order to justify a one-dimensional formulation, channel length is expected to be an order of magnitude largerthan channel width and height. Furthermore, the flow path followsa single streamline through the passage. The quasi-onedimensional formulation assumes that all quantities are uniform across the cross section. This does not hold for wave rotors, ashigh rotational speeds due to centrifugal effects, vortices due tofinite passage opening effects, and shock-wave boundary layerinteractions create secondary flows and skewed air/gas demarcation surfaces, which cannot be captured using one-dimensionalwave action codes. While the effect of gradual passage openingon the primary shock strength can at least be qualitatively captured, interferences between neighboring channels and betweenthe channel and leakage cavity, which become particularly pronounced for larger axial clearances between rotor and stator, cannot be depicted directly.Governing Equations. The equations used to describe theunsteady, compressible, and viscous effects taking place within awave rotor turbine are the one-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations, which can be written in conservative form as 
The first term represents time-dependent variations, while the second term refers to advection. The source term S accounts for viscous as well as inviscid effects (i.e., friction and “blade” forces),as well as leakage losses and wall heat transfer. These will beexplained in more detail in the section Source Terms. The statevector U and the flux vector F are defined as 
Heat conduction within the fluid is addressed through Fourier’slaw of heat conduction. Furthermore, friction between particles isincluded through shear force. They can be more explicitly statedas 
The set of PDEs encompasses four primitive variables u, q, p, ande, which require the introduction of an additional equation toensure closure of the equation system. This is done by the idealgas equation relating pressure, temperature, and density 
The model further treats air as a calorically imperfect gas, wherespecific heat constant at constant pressure cp ¼ f(T) varies withtemperature. While this is less important for pressure exchangers,where temperatures can be close to ambient conditions, itbecomes more important at elevated temperatures exhibited in gasturbines, where the peak cycle temperature delivered from thecombustor exceeds 450–500 K [49]. Thermodynamic data for specific heat constant and internal energy used throughout this studystem from GRI-MECH [50] and the thermal database provided byVirginia Tech [51]. Finally, dynamic viscosity is modeled throughthe well-known Sutherland relation.Source TermsViscous and Inviscid Forces. The previous one-dimensionalmodels addressed merely viscous (friction) forces and did notdirectly address inviscid profile forces that account for shaftpower generation. Fluid viscosity determines wall friction andpromotes convective heat transfer. As a result, the correspondingsource term affects both the momentum and the energy equation.Friction force is defined as 
It features a friction multiplier Cf that accounts for additionalmomentum losses that cannot be captured with the relatively simple approach taken. As stated by Winterbone and Pearson [52],the friction factor f is a function of the Reynolds number withinthe channel and is given by 
where k denotes the surfaces roughness value, which was set to25 lm. Using the force diagram shown in Fig. 2(c), one can workout the tangential component of the friction factor and write thetotal source term as 
Torque generation in wave rotors is pulsatile in nature and is primarily generated when the channels are exposed to a high pressure inlet port. Throughout this study, tangential forces and thuspower generation are computed as a result of the momentumchange as the fluid travels along the cambered channel walls. 
Overall, this is exemplified by the change in velocity triangles atleading and trailing edge of a passage wall, as shown in Fig. 2(a).The corresponding blade force source term affects momentum andenergy equation and takes the form 
The tangential blade force per unit volume can be determinedusing the change in momentum, which is influenced by the difference in absolute tangential velocity Ch across leading and trailingedge, the mass flow rate through the channel m_ , and the channelvolume V. In the discretized domain, this force is calculated foreach element taking the difference in the tangential velocity vector from one cell to the next into account 
Friction forces are accounted for by the previously suggested viscous source term. Thus, the blade force source term acts in aninviscid way so that one can assume the blade force vector to beorthogonal to the relative velocity vector, as given in Fig. 2(b).Hence, the scalar product of blade force vector and relative velocity vector equals zero and the equation can be rearranged to givethe axial inviscid blade force per unit volume 
In reality, the port angles will be aligned at a different angle thanthe passage walls angle. This can take place at off-design conditions or if an additional momentum change is desired at the statorrotor interface in order to create more torque. In addition, flowseparation on the passage wall “suction side” can often be witnessed if the port angle is considerably larger than the passagewall angle. To account for such incidence losses, an additionalentropy-based loss coefficient is introduced and applied in theform of a distributed loss factor. It can be calibrated throughexperimental data or three-dimensional CFD simulations 
Flow Leakage. 
The effect of leakage is a crucial factor in waverotor performances and was modeled as a simple, nonlabyrinthleak in similar fashion as in the previous publications from Kentfield, NASA, and ONERA [35,39,53]. Leakage is modeled as alumped capacitance model assuming steady flow equations. Itconcerns both continuity as well as energy equation, so that theleakage source term may be stated as 
where CD is the discharge coefficient, p and q the pressure and thedensity in channel or cavity, respectively, h denotes enthalpy, dlthe axial clearance between rotor and stator, and Dz the cell sizeused for discretization. The leakage function U takes up the form,which allows to differentiate between flow entering and leavingthe cavity depending on the pressure ratio in cell and leakagecavity 
The source terms are only active at the extremities of the rotorchannel and are set to zero in the remainder of the domain. Aftereach cycle, the mass and energy balance are computed, and thecavity pressure and temperature updated from a first-order systemof differential equations as provided by Eq. (16). The equationsdesignate continuity and the energy equation derived from the firstlaw of thermodynamics and are integrated in time using anexplicit Runge–Kutta scheme. Cavity pressure can be found byapplying the equation of state for ideal gases 
The heat transfer term stands for the heat transfer from the waverotor wall temperature. For the respective heat transfer coefficient,a Nusselt number relation for annuli with inner cylinder rotationwas used [54] 
Wall Heat Transfer.
 The viscous source term given in Eq. (7)features the wall temperature to compute convective heat transfer.During operation and constant inlet temperatures from the ports,the rotor temperature settles at a constant value. In order toinclude the effect of wall heat transfer, a lumped capacitancemodel that follows the first-order differential equation given inEq. (18) was implemented 
Domain Discretization.
The explicit, second-order accuratescheme of Richtmyer in combination with a minmod flux limiterof Roe and Baines was selected for the discretization of the governing equations in space and time. This allows for an accurateresolution of flow discontinuities while obeying time variationdiminishing criterion and preventing spurious oscillations fromtaking place in their vicinity. The proposed scheme suggests atwo-step technique where additional half timesteps are introduced.The first step consists of a first-order accurate Lax-Friedrichsmethod, which can be obtained through the integration of Eq. (1)in space and time and assuming the intercell fluxes to be the average of two consecutive cells 
Boundary Conditions
For the implementation of boundary conditions, a cell-centeredapproach has been chosen. This involves the addition of an imagecell lying just outside of the domain. In general, one can distinguish between inflow, outflow, and wall boundaries. For each ofthese types, one needs to determine the flow variables on theimage cells. Walls are treated as reflective boundaries where pressure and density are equal to the neighboring interior cell node,while velocity is assigned the same value with the opposite sign.Assuming subsonic inflow, it is necessary to specify two characteristics entering the domain, while one characteristic leaves thedomain. Therefore, stagnation properties (temperature and pressure) are imposed, while velocity is extrapolated in the zerothorder. This approach further guarantees a simple way to compareresults with experimental conditions. When computing the flowvariables at the image cell, it is crucial to consider that the stagnation properties are defined in the absolute frame of reference,while the code operates in the relative frame of reference.For outflows, one characteristic enters the domain, while twocharacteristics leave the domain. Thus, a single physical conditionneeds to be imposed (static outlet pressure) and the remaining twoare extrapolated from the domain interior.Unfortunately, this is only valid for fully exposed channels.There are, however, periods where only a certain portion of thechannel is exposed to a port, as shown in Fig. 3(a). This gradualpassage opening is of paramount importance in the formation ofprimary shock waves [55]. To account for this, a function is defined that determines the amount of overlap based on port opening and closing positions, channel width, and the channel positionat each time-step.If this function is between zero and one, the port is only partially open and an alternative solution for the boundary conditionsis calculated. In the case of inflow, the principle is given in Fig.3(b). The gas enters the domain from a reservoir described bystagnation properties for pressure and temperature in the form of ajet through the cross section area at station 2. At station 1, the jetfurther expands to cover the entire width. The first cell in thedomain is at station i. Assuming steady flow conditions, one canformulate the three conservative equations for mass, momentum,and energy between stations 1 and 2 as 
giving three equations for six unknowns in total. The set of equations is closed using the energy equation and isentropic relationbetween stations 0 and 1 as well as wave and pathline compatibility relations [52]. In a similar fashion, one can formulate the problem for partially open outflows, as given in Fig. 3(c). Here, gasflowing through a cross-sectional area of A1 exits the domainthrough area A2. In the subsonic case, the pressure at station 2equals the reservoir pressure at plane 2. Together with the conservation of mass and energy as well as the isentropic relationbetween stations 1 and 2 and the corresponding compatibilityequations, all six unknowns can be determined.ProcedureThe solution procedure of the code shall be introduced usingthe example of a four-port throughflow wave rotor, as shown inthe unfolded view of a single wave rotor cycle in the z t/h planein Fig. 4. The ports are designated as high pressure gas inlet(HPG), high pressure air (HPA), low pressure air (LPA), and lowpressure gas (LPG), referring to high pressure gas and air and lowpressure air and gas, respectively.It follows the steps outlined in Fig. 5(b). Initially, geometricdimensions of the rotor and target rotational speed of the waverotor are specified. Furthermore, the number of cycles per rotationand the port solution needs to be provided. An initial guess andrough layout can be devised through the analytical tools given by Chan and Liu [43] and M€ uller and coworkers [56–58]. Subsequently, all matrices used throughout the computation are, alongwith the spatial domain, initialized. In terms of the time-step, aninitial estimation is provided. While a uniform grid is used, thetime-step size is allowed to vary depending on the maximumwave speed maxi_x0007_  jun i j þ an i in the domain at the previous timestep and a fixed CFL number of 0.7 [52]. This allows us to savecomputational time as otherwise a constant time-step would needto suit the largest velocities in the domain and would thus have tobe more on the conservative side.In open loop configuration (without a closed combustor loop),stagnation properties in the HPG port are fixed, while static pressure in the HPA port is varied automatically using a simple proportional controller based on a simple Bernoulli relation until themass flow rates are matched and within a 2% relative error. Thelow pressure inlet conditions generally involve ambient temperature of around 300 K, while the total inlet pressure again beingvaried in the same manner as for the HPA port and according tothe desired loop flow ratio 
In the low pressure gas port, exhaust gases are expelled to theambient and the static pressure is again automatically adjusted togive the desired inlet mass flow rate m_ HPG. At the end of eachcycle, combustor and leakage cavity properties are updated andport flow conditions need to be determined. This is done through mass flux averaging according to Eq. (25) and converting the values into the absolute frame of reference 
Before the next cycle commences, conditions within the channelat the cycle end are set as initial conditions for the subsequentcycle, thus guaranteeing periodicity. Finally, the simulation isstopped either when the maximum number of cycles is reached orthe relative changes of combustor and leakage temperature andpressures are below a predefined threshold 
Results and Discussion. 
The results presented in the sectionResults and Discussion seek to exhibit the code’s ability to predictresults from wave rotor experiments. This shall be done in twostages. First of all, performance data of two three-port pressure dividers are produced and compared with data from the open literature. These are Kentfield’s pressure divider from the 1960s [47]and NASA pressure divider from the mid-1990 s [48]. After that,laboratory experiments conducted at the University of Bath on al-wave rotor turbine are used to test the code when dealing withfour port, throughflow wave rotor turbines with symmetricallycambered profiles.Wave Rotor Pressure Dividers. The geometric dimensionsand operating conditions of the two investigated designs are givenin Table 1. The main characteristics of both designs shall bebriefly introduced. Kentfield’s device is characterized by relatively large channel width, while NASA’s three-port design hasfour times the number of channels and has, as a consequence, arather small channel width. Thus, it can be expected that finiteopening timing effects are of minor importance. In terms oflength, the NASA design is longer, so that viscous losses becomemore pronounced. Leakage plays a reduced role in Kentfield’sexperiments owing to tighter clearances between the rotor and stator endwalls.Rotational speed of both designs and total inlet temperature inthe medium pressure port are fixed in both simulations. Total inletpressure in the medium pressure port is variable for the Kentfieldexperiments. In the model, the total outlet pressure of the highpressure port is varied in both cases to give a desired mass flowratio m_ M=m_ H ranging from 0.1 to 0.6. The NASA experiment wasconducted at a constant mass flow ratio of 0.37. The unfoldedmidplane view for the two pressure exchangers with the anticipated wave pattern and relative positions of the three respectiveports is given in Fig. 6. Solid red curves denote shock waves,hatched blue areas expansion fans, and dashed gray lines (weak)pressure waves.Using the MATLAB code on Kentfield’s three-port pressuredivider yields the results depicted in Fig. 7. All data were produced with a grid resolution of Dz/L ¼ 0.0135 and a dischargecoefficient of 0.67 and a friction multiplier of 1.77. The plotsshow total pressure for the high pressure port on the ordinate andtotal pressure for the low pressure port on the abscissa for four different mass flow ratios. All values are nondimensionalized withrespect to the inlet total pressure and inlet mass flow rate, respectively. Figure 7(a) shows a comparison of the 1D-Navier–Stokesequation (that includes particle friction and heat conduction in thefluid but without wall heat transfer, friction, and leakage model)compared with the experimental data. Clearly, the pressure levelin the high pressure port is overpredicted with an increasing deviation toward lower pressure levels in the low pressure port. The full model results are then shown in Fig. 7(b) outlining the effectlosses impart. The main loss mechanisms responsible for the difference are leakage and friction, confirming the findings of theprevious studies [35,39]. Since maximum temperatures in bothcases are relatively low, wall heat transfer plays a minor role.The same model parameters were then applied to performunsteady validation using the NASA three-port wave rotor. Thisexperiment featured static pressure traces at three locations,namely at z/L ¼ 0.025, z/L ¼ 0.5, and z/L ¼ 0.975, within a waverotor passage as it travels through the circumference. Evaluatingthe numerical results and normalized static pressure at the channelends, namely at data against the numerical results, gives the distribution shown in Fig. 8. In comparison with Fig. 6(b), one can witness the initial expansion fan generated upon opening the lowpressure port on the right-hand side. This is well captured in themodel, although the expansion ratio at z/L ¼ 0.025 remainsslightly overpredicted. The subsequent shock discontinuity issharper than in the experiments and features a sharp peak for bothprimary and secondary shock waves. The overall shock pressureratio across all stations is, however, well depicted. The finalexpansion fan as well as the attenuation of the pressure wave takes place slightly sooner, as seen at around 
Bath l-Wave Rotor TurbineLayout and Operating Conditions. The third validation casedeals with a four-port, three-cycle throughflow wave rotor withsymmetrically cambered wall profiles. The rotor was designed toyield approximately 500 W of shaft power output at a target peakcycle temperature of 750 C and HPG total inlet pressure of285 kPa. The port solution is shown in Fig. 4 and can be dividedinto a high pressure and low pressure section in the bottom andtop, respectively. The former encompasses a HPG and a HPA outlet that would form the combustor loop in a gas turbine arrangement, while the latter houses the LPA inlet and a LPG outlet . Adetailed view of the symmetrically cambered wall profiles and aphotograph of the rotor and endplates with the corresponding portopenings are given in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b).Geometric dimensions and operating conditions that will beused for the simulations are given in Table 2. The rotor has a midwidth diameter of 60 mm, length of 30 mm, and features 46 symmetrically cambered channels with a maximum profile angle of21.5 deg. In total, three cycles are covered in a single rotation andthe design speed is set to 32,000 rpm, giving a tangential speed inthe midwidth plane of 100 m/s.The wave rotor test rig encompasses an open loop configuration, as shown in Fig. 10(a). A set of industrial compressors provides pressurized and dry air to the inlet side (HPG and LPA).The corresponding flow rates and thus the flow ratio k are controlled through a set of pneumatically actuated gate valves andmeasured through differential mass flow meters. On the HPG leg,the incoming air is additionally directed through an air-to-air heatexchanger to use hot exhaust gases from the outlet side beforebeing run through a set of 44 kW-electrical heaters that ensure thetarget inlet temperature is reached. Rotational speed and shaftpower output is measured through an eddy-current dynamometerthat modulates the load on the wave rotor. It is coupled to thewave rotor through a single-plane coupling. On the outlet side,further gate valves ensure the mass flow rates in the high pressurezone, i.e., between HPG and HPA, can be matched accuratelybefore being expelled from the test chamber through extractionfans. Figure 10(b) exhibits a photograph from the test chamberdisplaying the electrical heaters as well as the wave rotor anddynamometer units and outlet gate valves.The design of the wave rotor encompassed a variable nominalaxial clearance between 0.1 and 0.4 mm. Unfortunately, it wasfound during the experiments that the nominal clearance differedsignificantly from its design value due to uneven thermal expansion. As the exact values of the actual clearances could not bedetermined, it was decided to use the nominal values for throughout the validation study.Rotor Characteristics. Before moving on to the results, it isnecessary to classify the wave rotor performance with respect toother existing machines. Table 3 lists a comparison of nondimensional performance parameters for finite passage opening T, viscosity F, and leakage flow G for various wave rotor types, asdefined by Nagashima et al. [6] and Wilson and Fronek [48].Although comparison is somewhat difficult for pure pressureexchangers and wave rotor turbines operating at high temperatures, one can see that the Bath l-wave rotor performs similarlywith respect to finite opening timing effects despite its short rotorlength. As expected, due to the small size compared with largerdesigns, viscous losses become more pronounced and is similar tothe microwave rotor study conducted at the University of Tokyo& ONERA [6]. The most critical loss mechanism for the investigated design is without a doubt leakage effects, which is at bestsimilar to the ABB Comprex and the University of Tokyo. In reality, however, it is anticipated that uneven thermal expansion ofstators and the shaft-rotor assembly account for a considerably larger G-parameter approaching 0.2–0.23. This effect however,cannot be captured in a one-dimensional environment and needsto be taken into account through the leakage coefficient CD. Anadditional effect of leakage that cannot be identified using onedimensional code is that increasing leakage gaps promote theinteraction between neighboring channels effectively attenuatingin particular the reflected secondary shock extensively.Model Validation. For the first part of the experimental validation, rotational speed was swept from 24,000 rpm to the designspeed of 32,000 rpm in steps of around 2000 rpm. This is done fortwo different nominal leakage gaps, namely 0.20 mm on the inletand 0.25 mm on the outlet side as well as 0.3 mm on both in- andoutlet side, respectively. In addition, the peak cycle temperatureTt,HPG was varied from 500 C to 600 C. The loop flow ratio k ismaintained constant at 1.7. In the second part of the validationstudy, k is varied in steps of 0.5 between 1.7 and 2.7. The totalinlet pressure remains at approximately 270 kPa throughout.Variations in rotational speed lead to different velocity trianglesat both in- and outlet. To account for these variations and associated misalignment of the flow with the rotor profiles, a parameterfit was made for the loss coefficient floss. The linear relationshipdetermined from this is given in Fig. 11(a) and used throughoutthe validation study. The same procedure was applied to the leakage coefficient CD. Here, the situation becomes more complicated as different leakage gaps account for slightly different characteristics, as illustrated in Fig. 11(b). The reason for this lies most likelyin the fact that actual leakage gaps are not known and merely thenominal values were taken. Hence, the selected discharge coefficient partially accounts for this lack in information. The reasonwhy one sees a variation of the leakage coefficient with speed canbe explained by additional blockage or greater dynamic head created in the leakage gap through higher rotational speeds, similaras witnessed in turbomachinery [59]. Finally, the friction multiplier was set to 2.7 throughout the simulations. A similarly highvalue was witnessed in the studies by Paxson and Wilson [39].At the design speed of 32,000 rpm Fig. 12 gives the numericallydetermined unfolded view of both wave pattern in the left-handside contour plot and temperature distribution in the right-handcontour plot. The plot also shows the predicted velocity profiles ineach port and the extent of gradual passage opening. Marked instations S1 and S2 are primary (right running) and secondaryshock (left running) waves generated upon opening of the highpressure gas (HPG) inlet and high pressure air (HPA) outlet. Further shown are expansion fans E1 and E2 produced as a result ofHPG closing and LPG opening. The temperature distribution indicates inherent exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) characteristic toaxial throughflow machines as well as a small amount of fresh airexhaustion (FAE) through the exhaust port LPG.The effect of gradual passage opening is shown in Fig. 12(b),where mark T1 indicates the initiation of the primary shock wave before progressively increases toward the fully developed level atapproximately T2. The predicted instantaneous and cycleaveraged power output for a single channel is given in Fig. 12(c).It becomes apparent that solely the flow entering through the HPGport results in torque generation, while opening of the LPG portand inflow through LPA does not significantly contribute to overall power generation. This is of course expected as the flowthrough the HPG port signifies the flow with the highest enthalpy.The total expected power output is then evaluated by multiplyingthe number of channels with the cycle-averaged value. The plotfurther indicates that the proposed symmetric, arc shape is not anoptimum with respect to torque generation, which is outlined bypositive regions in the instantaneous power trace near openingand closure of the HPG port.Comparing power output, pressure ratio, and outlet temperaturefrom the HPA duct for the experimentally determined dataset withthe simulation model shows the group of plots displayed inFig. 13. The first plot on the top left denotes total pressure ratiodata obtained for a maximum inlet temperature of 500 C and anominal clearance of 0.20 mm on the inlet and 0.25 mm on theoutlet side. The model accurately predicts the total pressure distribution well across the entire speed sweep. As expected, increasedleakage gaps result in compromised energy transfer and thuslower achieved pressure ratio. This trend is reflected in the modelresults, although there is an overprediction in pressure ratio with arelative error between experiments and simulation of around10–15%. Furthermore, the model predicts a pronounced drop-offin pressure ratio as one approaches lower rotational speeds, whichhas not been witnessed in the experiments. Opposed to the validation on pure pressure exchangers of Kentfield and NASA, there isa more pronounced discrepancy between simulation results andexperimental data. This can at least partly be attributed to the factthat experimental work on pressure exchangers was done at nearlyambient temperature conditions. This renders thermal expansioneffects; minimal and axial clearances between stator and rotors are likely to remain unchanged from their nominal values. For thewave rotor turbine under investigation here, peak temperaturesdiffer significantly from ambient conditions and uneven thermalexpansion between rotor and stators that cause the axial clearancegap to increase in size, which severely affects in particular thesecondary shock wave strength and thus the achieved pressureratio.Raising maximum inlet temperature from 500 C to 600 Cresults in an increase in pressure ratio as a consequence of moreenthalpy being directed to the wave rotor. While the overall trendis also reflected in the simulation results, the model indicates thatthe increase in temperature appears to outweigh the penalty inlarger leakage flow, while in the experiments this is clearly notthe case. This shortcoming exemplifies the sensitivity of the system that arises when choosing model factors, thus limiting its predictive capabilities. 
The model yields good results with respect to predicted poweroutput for all simulated conditions, shown in Fig. 13(b). Power isslightly overpredicted throughout with a relative error of around5–10%. The power output increase shown in (b) stems from anincrease in HPG mass flow rate of 34 g/s compared to 32 g/s in thelow leakage case.Finally, Fig. 13(c) gives a comparison of the averaged totaltemperature at the HPA outlet with the experimental data recordedthrough thermocouples close to the port outlet. Across all testedconditions, the relative error varies between 1% and 6%. Whilethere seems to be moderate (left and right) to no (center) variationwith respect to rotational speed changes, the model predictssteeper line gradients. This is a consequence of the model predictions regarding exhaust gas recirculation at the HPA port. Thetemperature distribution shown in Fig. 12 implies some FAE.Reducing FAE by allowing more fresh air being directed to theHPA port before the port closes. This reduces EGR rates at theHPA port and accounts for a slightly lower mixed-out temperature. This effect is well shown in Fig. 13(a). The simulationresults in (center) and (right) almost show the same gradient withrespect to speed as in the low leakage case in (left). The discrepancy between the two stems again from the effects of leakage,where increased leakage promotes interaction and flow betweenone channel, another channel, and the leakage cavities around it.Thus more hot air is ingested into the cold air stream leading tomore or less the same average outlet temperature.Figure 14 exhibits the effect of a variation in loop flow ratiofrom 1.7–2.2 and 2.7 with rotational speed. The model correctlypredicts an increase in pressure ratio with increasing loop flowratio. However, while there is a relatively small difference at aloop flow ratio of 1.7 of less than 3%, the model reacts more sensitively to an increase in loop flow ratio resulting in higher pressure ratios and increased error. Higher loop flow ratio signifies areduced cold air mass being ingested into the wave rotor resultingin a higher average rotor temperature and thus altered thermalexpansion. The Q1D-model cannot account for this change inleakage characteristic, which results in a greater error between thesimulation results and the experimentally determined data. 
Predicted shaft power output captures the trends of increasingpower output with increasing loop flow ratio. The main mechanism for this is an increase in inlet mass flow rates to around 34 g/s at k ¼ 2.2 and 35.5 g/s at k ¼ 2.7. However, the increase indicated in the experiments is higher than shown for the simulationmodel, resulting at a maximum underprediction in shaft power atk ¼ 2.7 of approximately 8%.Looking at the averaged temperature in the HPA port, the maximum relative error between experiments and simulations is ataround 4%. The model is able to predict the effects of the decreasein fresh air flow well. Higher loop flow ratios increase EGR andthus mark a reduced effect of fresh air temperature on the mixedout average temperature. As a result, average temperaturesincrease as is both witnessed in the model and experiments. Furthermore, varying rotational speed has most influence on HPAoutlet temperature at low loop flow ratios, where EGR rate is generally lower. At higher flow ratios, EGR rate is high and the HPAtemperature less sensitive to a variation in rotational speed. Thiseffect is recorded in the simulation results through a reducedgradient.
Conclusions and Outlook. 
This paper presented a numericalmodel that extends the previous one-dimensional codes to allowcomputation of torque generation in curved rotor passages throughadditional source terms that compute inviscid blade forces. Themodel was furthermore validated through both literature data andexperimental data from a symmetrically cambered microwaverotor developed at the University of Bath. The main points of thepaper can be summarized as follows: The objective of the study was to perform model validationthrough literature data for straight channeled pressureexchangers run at low temperature and through experimentaldata obtained from a symmetrically cambered microwaverotor developed at the University of Bath. The comparison with literature data for pressure exchangersat constant speed and inlet conditions yields good agreementfor both steady and unsteady flow data. This gives confidence that the model is able to predict fundamental characteristics,such as wave patterns and port flow conditions. It furtheremphasizes the importance of loss mechanisms on the performance characteristics of wave rotors. A comparison of the model with sub-1 kW microwave rotorturbine data yielded promising results and showed that themodel is able to identify the variation of pressure ratio andtemperature with rotational speed. Predicted power outputwas also in very good agreement with the experimental data.Nonetheless, a few restrictions in the model persist and canbe listed as follows:– The model appears to react more sensitively to changesin inlet temperature and leakage gap than witnessed inthe experiments 
Increases in nominal leakage lead to a larger relativeerror between the determined total pressure ratio forexperiments and simulation. The issue is exacerbated ifonly the nominal, rather than the actual leakage gap for athermally stable operating point is known rendering thedetermination of leakage coefficients difficult and resultsmore deviating from experimentally determined ones.– Power predictions are slightly overpredicted throughout,but show similar trends as in the experiments and varyonly marginally with respect to changes in rotationalspeed. However, an additional loss factor is required toaccount for the (mis-)alignment of the flow at the port/rotor interface. For higher loop flow ratios, the increasein power output in the simulation results is lower compared to the experiments, resulting in a slight underprediction for k ¼ 2.2.The model is able to predict port outlet temperatureswell, but fails to identify the effects larger leakage gapsincur. The effect of reduced EGR rates and thus morefresh air being directed through the HPA port appears tobe more pronounced than witnessed in the experiments.Also, the ingestion of air from neighboring channels andthe leakage cavity seem to become more pronounced atelevated leakage gaps, which cannot be identified by themodel. However, trends showing the effect of increasedloop flow ratio on the outlet temperature are capturedwell. The introduced model facilitates wave rotor turbine designprocess, as it provides the means to investigate both the pressure exchange capabilities of the wave rotor as well as its use as a power turbine. It can thus be used for initial sizing andas an inexpensive design tool to vary channel camber beforemore expensive CFD modeling tools are applied.                                Dropwise condensation theory revisited: Part I. Droplet nucleation radius

Abstract 
     An improved thermodynamic model is developed for the critical radius for droplet condensation on subcooled surfaces having a promoter coating layer. In addition to heat conduction through the droplet, this model takes into consideration thermal resistances of the coating layer, the liquid vapor interface, and curvature depression of the equilibrium interface temperature, which are important in nanosize droplets. The critical radius for droplet condensation is obtained based on the availability criterion, and effects of contact angles, degree of subcooling, thickness and thermal conductivity of the coating layer, and saturated pressure on droplet nucleation radius are illustrated. Furthermore, the critical radius for condensation on a superhydrophilic subcooled surface without a promoter coating layer obtained from this new model recovers to the critical radius of droplet condensation in classical heterogeneous nucleation of droplets.

Introduction
     About 80 years ago, Schmidt et al. found that dropwise condensation heat transfer had a much higher heat transfer coefficient than that of dropwise condensation. Since that time, much experimental and theoretical work has been carried out on dropwise condensation heat transfer. In early years, the problem of onset of droplet condensation was the focus of study. In 1936, Jakob proposed that very thin layers of steam condensed initially on the subcooled surface, and the thin film fractured into droplets after a certain thickness was reached. Tammann and Boehme proposed a different droplet condensation mechanism, suggesting that droplet nuclei randomly existed initially on subcooled surfaces. This mechanism was later confirmed by McCormick and Baer＊s experimental observation, which showed that droplets nucleated on cavities on the condenser surface. Umur  and Griffith used an optical microscope to detect thin films of molecular dimensions, and no film greater than a monolayer thickness. Based on the equilibrium theory of Gibbs free energy and assuming that temperature of the vapor at a uniform temperature, Graham and Griffith gave the following expression for the critical radius for droplet condensation on a subcooled wall at Tw with the degree of subcooling given by DTsub, i.e. where ql is the density of the liquid, rlv the liquid每vapor surface tension, T is the saturated temperature of the vapor, and hfg the latent heat. Eq. (1) has been used for calculation of critical radius for drop- wise condensation heat transfer until recently. Most recently, Quan et al. obtained the critical radius for droplet condensation on a subcooled surface in a saturated vapor based on changes in Gibbs free energy and availability analyses, assuming a linear temperature distribution between the wall and the top  of the droplet at a saturated temperature. A review of literature on early work on onset of droplet condensation, droplet nucleation density, single droplet heat transfer, and nucleation mechanism from the molecular viewpoint is given by Khandekar and Muralidhar.
    In this paper, we will obtain the critical radius for onset of droplet condensation on a subcooled wall having a promoter coating layer based on the change in availability. This new model takes into consideration thermal resistances of the coating layer, the liquid vapor interface, and curvature depression of the equilibrium interface temperature, where the latter two effects become important in nanosize droplets. Thus, the new model for the critical radius for droplet condensation differs from previous models in two different aspects: (i) there is no need to assume temperature distribution in the droplet adjacent to the wall such as uniform temperature in or linear temperature distribution in, and (ii) effects of thermal resistance of coating, interfacial thermal resistance of the liquid vapor interface as well as curvature depression are taken into consideration. This newly developed model on the critical radius of heterogeneous droplet condensation will be applied to the study of dropwise condensation heat transfer on a subcooled surface in Part II of this paper series.

Thermodynamic analyses on onset of droplet condensation
    Consider the formation of a droplet with radius r on a smooth subcooled surface at Tw having a coating layer with thickness d in a saturated vapor at Ts and ps, as shown in Fig. 1. We now carry out a thermodynamic analysis to study onset of droplet condensa- tion on a subcooled surface by making the following two assumptions: The local temperature of vapor before onset of droplet conden- sation is the same as after onset of droplet condensation, i.e. This assumption is based on the local thermal equilibrium of the vapor and liquid before and after onset of droplet condensation. The vapor adjacent to surface before onset of droplet condensation is at ps(Ts) where ps(Ts) is the saturated pressure at Ts and at Tv (where Tv < Ts), i.e., at a subcooled state, or ps(Ts) > ps(Tv), i.e., at a supersaturated state.
    The change in Gibbs free energy from local supersaturated vapor to subcooled liquid is presented in a p每T diagram as shown in Fig. 2, where the supersaturated vapor initially at Point 2 is condensed into subcooled liquid at Point 3 undergoing a constant temperature process. The vapor before phase change is at Point 2, where ps(Tv) > ps(Ts) = pv, so that the vapor is supersaturated or subcooled initially. The liquid inside the droplet at Point 3 is subcooled because  pl > pv. We  now determine. The specific Gibbs function g=G/m is the change in specific Gibbs free energy from subcooled vapor to subcooled liquid undergoing a constant temperature process can be calculated from. To evaluate the second term in the right hand side of Eq. (4), we note that one of the thermodynamic relations gives where s is specific entropy, cp is specific heat at constant pressure and v is specific volume of the fluid. In order to obtain the specific Gibbs free energy of the liquid gl at Point 3 and the specific Gibbs free energy of the vapor gv at Point 2, one saturated state at Point 1 or Point 4 is chosen for simplification of dp = 0 and dT = 0, respectively. For the constant pressure process for vapor from a saturated condition at Point 1 at temperature Ts and pressure ps(Ts) to Point 2 at a subcooled state with temperature Tv and pressure ps(Ts), the specific entropy of vapor can be given by an integration of Eq. (5) from Point 1 to Point 2 to give. and the specific entropy of liquid at Point 3 can be obtained from an integration of Eq. (5) from Point 1 to Point 3 to give for liquid is used in Eq. (7). The change of specific entropy between the vapor before droplet nucleation and liquid after droplet nucleation by subtracting Eq. (7) from Eq. (6) to give. 
    To evaluate the first term in the right-hand side of Eq. (4), we note that another thermodynamic relation for the change in enthalpy between the supersaturated vapor at Point 2 and the subcooled liquid at Point 3 can be calculated accordingly. And the enthalpy of supersaturated vapor at temperature Tv and pressure ps(Ts) at Point 2 and the enthalpy of the subcooled liquid  at temperature T and pressure p at Point 3 is. Expanding the third term at the right hand of Eq. (11) with a Taylor expansion and neglecting small terms, the above equation gives. which is also given by Quan et al. Eq. (12) can also be obtained by the second approach, by way of Point 4 (a saturated state) at Tl (or Tv) and ps(Tv) to Point 2 at Tv and ps(Ts) for vapor, and to Point 3 at Tl and pl for liquid, which is an isothermal process with dT = 0. The change in chemical potential can be calculated from Gibbs每Duhem equation. where ps(Tv) is the saturated pressure at Tv and Rg is the specific gas constant. On the other hand, for the subcooled liquid phase at Point 3, Eq. (13) is used again to calculate its chemical potential from Point  4 to Point  3. Since  the  liquid  is  virtually  incompressible with vl  taken to be constant,  its chemical potential is determined as. where p (T ) is the saturated pressure at T. Eqs. (14) and (15) were obtained previously by Khandekar and Muralidhar. For a pure substance, the specific Gibbs free energy is equal with its chemical potential. With the help of the assumption Tv = Tl, the change in specific Gibbs free energy is. An integration of the Clausius Clapeyron equation gives rise to the saturated pressure equation as. The change of availability during droplet condensation is given by. where Alv, Asl and Asv is the surface area change of liquid vapor, solid liquid, and solid vapor interface after nucleation. When Young＊s equation is applied, and combining it with Eq. (12), then Eq. (19) can be simplified to. where Tl is the temperature inside the droplet and h is the contact angle. In order to perform the integration in Eq. (20), Graham and drop
    Griffith assumed that Tl is uniform and Quan et al assumed that Tl is linear with distance from the wall. In the following, we will derive Tl without making any assumption in its temperature distribution and then obtain the critical radius for droplet condensation.

Determination of temperature inside the droplet
    We note from Fig. 3 that the liquid temperature Tl in the droplet can be obtained from where Rg is the specific gas constant. The local differential volume where the right-hand side of Eq. (21a) can be obtained from Kim
and Kim  as follows. Where d is the thickness of the coating, and u is a shape fitted coordinate introduced by Kim and Kim for droplet which is related to x and h (see Fig. 3) by. Which is in terms of the local coordinate u. Substituting Eq. (22) for interesting to note that the change in availability is equal to zero for a subcooled superhydrophilic surface with h = 0. This implies that filmwise condensation occurs on a superhydrophilic subcooled surface without any nucleation work.
    We now obtain the critical radius rc for heterogeneous droplet nucleation from Eq. (26a) according to where the value of the critical radius rc is obtained from Eq. (26) numerically. Note that in all of previous droplet nucleation theories, the minimum radius for droplet was assumed to be Rmin=r0 but in this paper we will assume that rmin = rc, which is determined below.

Results and discussion
     In this section, we will present results of the critical radius rc for droplet condensation of water vapor on a subcooled wall based on Eq. (26). Effects of subcooled degree, contact angle, coating thickness, thermal conductivity of coating layer and saturated vapor pressure on the critical radius will be analyzed. Also, the variation of change in availability versus droplet radius will be discussed.
    The change in availability DW given by Eq. (26a) during forma- tion of an embryo droplet in a subcooled water under the condition of  DT sub = 4 ∼C and Ts = 100 ∼C for contact angles of h=5∼ and h=150∼ is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b) respectively, where the critical radii rc are obtained based on the criterion of DW/or =0, where the change in availability is given by Eq.(26a). As shown from Fig. 4(a) and (b), the critical radii are 5.0 nm  for  h = 5∼ and 5.6 nm for h=150∼,  and the corresponding changes in availability are respectively.  Comparing Fig. 4(a) and (b), it can be seen that both the critical radius and the change in availability increase with an increase in the contact angle.
    The critical embryo radius for droplet condensation on a subcooled surface obtained from the above model at DW/or = 0 without a promoter coating layer is given in Fig. 5. The result from the classical heterogeneous droplet nucleation given by Eq. (1) is also presented. It is shown from this figure that the critical radius for droplet condensation decreases with increasing degrees of subcooling. At the same degree of subcooling, the critical droplet radius increases with increasing contact angle. This is because the base area of the droplet becomes smaller at larger contact angles. On the other hand, the contact angle plays an important role for the droplet nucleation radius on hydrophobic surfaces, specifically at small degrees of subcooling. It should be noted that the present model for critical radius of droplet condensation in the limit of h0 almost recovers to the Eq. (1). This is because at the limit case of h=0 (a superhydrophilic surface), the droplet is  in contact with the subcooled surface with only one contact point and therefore the droplet temperature is uniform at Ts which demonstrates the validity of the present model. To see clearly the results at h = 0∼, an enlarged graph is plotted at the top right corner of Fig. 5, and a comparison of critical radii computed from the present model with h=0 and those from Eq. (1) is also presented in Table 1. It should be pointed out that film condensation can be considered as dropwise condensation with small critical droplet radius, which occurs on a superhydrophilic surface with h0. Thus, the curves for h=0 can be considered as the occurrence of filmwise condensation on a superhydrophilic surface.
    Temperature drops due to four thermal resistances in a single droplet at onset of condensation with critical radius rc computed according to Eqs. (21c), (23c), (23d) and (23e) for a surface with no coating at DTsub = 4 ∼C and Ts=100 ∼C are listed in Table 2. In this table, xi is the location of the interface at the top of the droplet (where u = h) which was computed according to Eq. (21d). From this table, we can see that the most important part of the four thermal resistances is the temperature depression due to the curvature effect which is large compared with the thermal conduction resistance through the embryo droplet. This is because the radius  r of an embryo droplet is very small, so the thermal resistance due to curvature is relatively large as determined by  Eq. 
Temperature distributions Tl in the droplet with respect to both   of u and x are presented in Fig. 6. The interfaces for these two cases are at xi = 5.017 nm for h = 90∼, and xi = 9.617 nm for h = 150∼ respectively. It is shown from Fig. 6(a) that although temperature varies linearly with respect to u, it varies nonlinearly with respect to x Fig. 6(d) at large contact angles. Thus, the assumption of an uniform temperature distribution in the droplet in the classical model for heterogeneous condensation  was wrong (since  it is valid only in the limit of h = 0 when filmwise condensation occurs on a superhydrophilic surface as mentioned earlier), and the assumption of a linear temperature distribution in the droplet for heterogeneous condensation is not accurate at large contact angles.
    Condensers are usually made of copper or aluminum which is hydrophilic in contact with water. A coating layer is usually applied on the subcooled surface to increase the contact angle of the subcooled surface for the purpose of promoting dropwise condensation heat transfer, which is a common industrial practice. Organic polymers such as polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE, ＆Tefion＊), and dioctadecy disulphide etc., are usually  applied  as the coating. Although coatings can promote good hydrophobicity, their thermal conductivities are very small (about 0.25 W/m K) compared with metals. These promoter coating layers will lead to an additional thermal resistance to the dropwise condensation process as analyzed in Section 2.2. Moreover, since the embryo droplet is in the range of nanometers, the thermal resistance due to coating layer will be especially significant. The effect of pro- moter coating layer on the embryo droplet radius is investigated below.nucleation radius on a promoter coating layer with respect to degree of subcooled and contact angle are similar with those with- out a coating layer. The critical radius for droplet condensation increases with the addition of a coating layer. Effects of contact angle are more remarkable on a surface with coating (Fig. 8) than those without a coating layer (Fig. 5). Also, the critical radius for onset of droplet condensation will not recover to Eq. (1) for a con- tact angle close to 0 if a coating layer is added on the substrate. Fig. 7 shows the effect of coating on changes in availability during droplet condensation. It is seen that the change in availability becomes larger with the addition of a coating layer. The maximum DW occurs at a larger critical radius for droplet condensation on a surface with coating than with those without a coating layer. Fig. 8 presents the critical radius for onset of droplet condensa- tion on a coating layer with thickness d=0.1 lm and thermal conductivity kcoat = 0.25 W/m K. The variation trends of droplet. Heat transfer characteristics of a single embryo droplet on a coating layer with d = 0.1 lm and kcoat = 0.25 W/m K at DTsub = 4 ∼C and Ts = 100 ∼C is given in Table 3 and Fig. 9. It is shown in Table 3
that the most important part of the four thermal resistances is the temperature depression resulting from the curvature. And the thermal conduction resistance through the embryo droplet is very small compared to the curvature effect. Comparing Table 3 with Table 2, it can be seen that DTdrop with coating is bigger than that without coating. This is because at a given degree of subcooling (say DTsub = 4 ∼C), droplet nucleates on a coating with a larger radius, so DTcur decreases according to Eq. (23d). And DTi increases with more liquid每vapor interface at a larger radius according to Eq. (23e). The temperature distribution inside the droplet is presented in Fig. 9 where the top interface for these two cases is located at xi = 8.68 nm for h = 90∼, and xi= 58.4 nm for h = 150∼ respectively. As shown in Fig. 9(d), temperature distribution inside the droplet is not linear with respect to x at a large contact angle. Fig. 10 shows the effect of coating layer＊s thickness on the crit- ical radius for onset of droplet condensation. It can be seen that a thicker coating layer will give rise to a larger critical radius for con- densation, since a thicker coating layer will increase its thermal resistance.  For a 1 lm coating layer with kcoat =0.25 W/m K, h=90∼ and Ts=100 ∼C, the critical radius for droplet condensation
is about 8 times larger than that prediction by Eq. (1) without a coating  layer.  A coating  layer with  thickness d < 0.1 lm has little influence on the droplet nucleation radius, so an ultrathin coating layer is desirable for dropwise condensation. For this reason, much work has been done to fabricate monolayer promoters for the purpose of promoting dropwise condensation. Fig. 11 shows effects of coating thermal conductivity on droplet nucleation radius. It can be seen that a coating layer with higher thermal conductivity will decrease droplet nucleation radius, since coating with higher thermal conductivity will reduce the thermal resistance of the heat transfer process. So, a thin coating layer with high thermal conductivity can decrease the droplet nucleation radius and is favorable for promoting dropwise condensation. Fig. 12 shows the effect of saturated vapor pressure ps on the critical radius for droplet condensation. Since values of thermophysical properties, such as saturated temperature Ts, latent heat hfg, liquid vapor density ql and qv, and surface tension rlv, are all related to the saturated pressure ps(Ts), physical properties will affect the critical radius for droplet condensation. It can be seen from Fig. 12 that the critical radius for droplet condensation increases at higher saturated vapor pressures. This is because at high saturated pressure ps, Ts increases while hfg decreases, the critical radius for droplet con- densation will be enlarged according to Eq. (1).

Concluding remarks
    In this paper, a thermodynamic model based on Gibbs free energy and availability is developed for heterogeneous condensa- tion nucleation on a subcooled surface with coatings. This model is a modification of previous dropwise nucleation theories in which the thermal resistance of coating on the surface, the interfacial thermal resistance of the liquid vapor interface and curvature depression of the equilibrium interface temperature have been taken into consideration. Based on the nucleation criterion for change of availability oDW/or = 0, nanometer scale critical radius for dropwise condensation can be predicted. The following conclusions can be drawn from this paper:
    Droplet condensation radius is small (in nm) at large degree of subcooling. Thus, the interface effect of temperature drop from vapor to liquid is very large and cannot be neglected.
    For subcooled surfaces having large contact angles, the temperature inside the nanoscale condensate droplet is not linear with respect to distance perpendicular from the subcooled surface.
    At high contact angles, the base area of the droplet in contact with the subcooled surface is small, resulting in a high thermal resistance and large droplet nucleation radius.
    At zero contact angle (i.e., a superhydrophilic subcooled surface), nano droplets with a uniform temperature at Ts are formed with a point contact with the subcooled surface at Tw. Film condensation occurs on a superhydrophilic surface at (h = 0∼) without nucleation work and condensation heat transfer.
    Although the addition of a coating layer can promote dropwise condensation, it will also increase the thermal resis- tance of the condensation process. A thin hydrophobic coating layer with a high thermal conductivity will decrease droplet nucleation radius and is desirable in practice.
    At higher vapor pressures with higher saturated temperature and smaller latent heat, the droplet nucleation radius will be enlarged.         Dropwise condensation theory revisited Part II. Droplet nucleation density and condensation heat flux

Abstract  
    An improved dropwise condensation heat transfer model modified from previous models is proposed in this paper. The critical radius for onset of droplet condensation is determined in the preceding paper (Part I), leading to a more accurate determination of droplet nucleation density and the coalescence radius in this paper (Part II). Effects of subcooling, contact angle, thickness and thermal conductivity of the coating layer on droplet nucleation density, condensation heat flux, and critical condensation heat transfer rate for onset of droplet condensation are illustrated. The predicted droplet nucleation density and dropwise condensation heat flux are shown in excellent agreement with existing experimental data.

Introduction
    The study of dropwise condensation heat transfer has attracted a great deal of attention since Schmidt performed his experiment on dropwise condensation heat transfer in 1930. Le Fevre and Rose developed the first dropwise condensation heat transfer model in 1966, in which the average condensation heat transfer was obtained by an analysis for heat transfer through a single droplet combined with the drop size distribution. In this single droplet model, three thermal resistances including conduction resistance, vapor liquid interfacial resistance and surface resistance were considered in series. Wu and Maa obtained an expression for calculation of dropwise condensation heat transfer by dividing the droplets into two groups: small droplets before coalescence and large droplets after coalescence; they used a population balance model to obtain drop size distribution of small droplets before coalescence which grow mainly by direct condensation. Abu-Oriba improved Wu and Maa¡¯s model by taking account of the thermal resistance of promoter coating based on a single droplet heat transfer model given by Le Fevre and Rose. A dropwise model similar to Abu-Oriba was recently proposed by Kim and Kim, who included the effect of contact angle on heat conduction in a single droplet. Although Kim and Kim¡¯s model for dropwise condensation heat transfer is a most comprehensive dropwise condensation model, it has a few short- comings: (i) the critical radius was determined from the critical radius for classical heterogeneous droplet nucleation condensation, which did not take into consideration effects of contact angle and coating layer, (ii) the value of droplet nucleation density is, and (iii) the model is unable to predict the critical heat transfer for onset of dropwise condensation.
    In this paper, we propose an improved dropwise condensation model which is based on the modification of Kim and Kim¡¯s model by using the more accurate expression for the critical radius for onset of droplet condensation  derived  in the  preceding paper to determine (i) the minimum droplet nucleation radius and  (ii)  the droplet nucleation density. Effects of contact angle, degree of subcooling, contact angle hysteresis, thickness and thermal conductivity of the coating layer and the saturated vapor pressure on dropwise condensation heat flux are analyzed. The predicted droplet nucleation density and dropwise condensation  heat flux are shown in excellent agreement with existing experimental data.

Previous models for dropwise condensation
    In this section, we will briefly review previous models for dropwise condensation on a subcooled surface. Wu and Maa assumed that droplets condense on a subcooled surface can be divided into two groups: a group of small size droplets (with radius from rmin to re) having a number density n(r), and a group of large size droplets (with radius from re to rmax) having a number density N(r) and gave the following expression for dropwise condensation heat transfer: where rmin is the minimum droplet radius, re is the coalescence radius, and qdrop is the heat transfer rate through a single droplet given by Kim and Kim as where h is the contact angle; d is the thickness of the coating; hcont is its thermal conductivity, and hi is the interfacial heat transfer coefficient is given by where a is the accommodation coefficient. Graham and Griffith assumed the minimum radius rmin of the droplets to be equal to the critical radius r0, which can be obtained from the classical heterogeneous droplet nucleation theory as. where DTsub = Ts-Tw is the degree of subcooling with Ts being the saturated temperature of the vapor; ql is the liquid condensate density, and rlv is liquid vapor surface tension, and hfg is the latent heat. It should be noted that Eq. (2a) has taken into consideration of the thermal resistances of the promoter, the liquid vapor interface, and the curvature depression of the equilibrium interface temperature. In the first integral of Eq. (1), n(r) is the drop size distribution of small droplets with radius from r0 to re, which is given by. The lower limit of the first integral is the critical radius rmin for droplet nucleation, and the upper limit in the first integral is the. Coalescence radius r is given by. Rose has derived a theoretical expression for droplet nucle- ation density which is given by. Where rmin = r0 is in all previous models. Although Eq. (4b) was derived in 1976, it has seldom been used in practice since Eq. (4b)  is known to be overestimating the droplet nucleation sites if rmin =  r0, where r0 is given by Eq. (2c). On the other hand, experimental values of droplet nucleation density Ns were found in the range from 109 m2 to 1015 m2, and this value was used in previous dropwise condensation models. In the second integral of Eq. (1), N(r) is the number density of large drops with radius from re to rmax which is given by. where rmax is maximum drop radius, which can be obtained according to the force balance between surface tension and gravity as with hr being the receding contact angle and has the advancing contact angle. Eqs. (1)-(5) with rmin=r0 is Kim and Kim¡¯s model for dropwise condensation heat transfer. It should be noted that the critical condensation heat flux from  Eq. (2a)  gives qdrop ro=0,  which is unrealistic since the critical heat flux is not equal to zero for bubble nucleation

The improved dropwise condensation model
    As mentioned earlier, we now propose an improved dropwise condensation model which differs from Kim and Kim¡¯s model in two aspects: the evaluation of (i) the critical radius for onset of droplet nucleation and (ii) the droplet nucleation density Ns, which will now be discussed. And the critical radius for onset of heterogeneous dropwise condensation rc is obtained by submitting Eq. (2a) with qdrop to Eq.(6a) and letting
where the value of the critical radius rc can be obtained numerically. The results of critical radius for nucleation of droplet condensation are presented in Part I in details, where effects of contact angles,degree of subcooling, thickness and thermal conductivity of the coating layer, and saturated pressure are discussed.
The condensation heat transfer rate at the onset of droplet condensation qdropercT can be obtained from Eq. (2a) by substituting r=rc to give where hi is given by Eq. (2b) with a=0.3 being chosen for computation in this paper. Eq shows that: and qdrop is not zero in the present model because latent heat is released when droplet is formed and heat is transferred from droplet to the subcooled wall. It is interesting to note that for h = 0(a superhydrophilic surface), rc=r0 and therefore i.e, film condensation occurs on a superhydrophilic
r is computed for different contact angles, subcooled degrees, coating thickness and thermal conductivity of the coating and the results are presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a) shows the effect of contact angle on critical condensation heat flux at the onset of droplet condensation. It is shown that (i) the critical condensation heat flux qdrop (rc) is small at small contact angles (i.e., on hydrophilic surfaces), (ii) qdrop (rc) increases as the contact angle becomes larger. The latter is because rc increases at larger contact angle (see Fig. 5 in Part I). As a result, we can see that the numerator of Eq. (7) increases, and this effect will play the major role. Similarly,  rc  becomes larger at lower subcooled degrees (Fig. 1(b)), bigger coating thickness (Fig. 1(c)), and lower thermal conductivity of coating (Fig. 1(d)), and under these conditions, qdrop(rc) given by Eq.(7) will also increase.
    As mentioned earlier, Eq. (4b) is known to be overestimating  the droplet nucleation sites if r0 is given by Eq. (2c).This implies that r0 given by Eq. (2c) may be too small especially when the subcooled surface has a coating layer. In this paper, we propose  that the analytical expression by Rose for droplet nucleation density Ns given by Eq. (4b) is to be calculated according to. where rc is the critical radius for onset of heterogeneous droplet nucleation given by Eq. (6), which has taken into consideration effects of contact angle, the thickness and thermal  conductivity  of a coating layer and liquid vapor interfacial thermal resistances. Effects of contact angle, the thickness and thermal conductivity of the coating layer on droplet nucleation density based on  Eq.(8) are presented in Fig.2. It can be seen from this figure that the values of the droplet nucleation density computed from Eq. (8) are in the same order of magnitude as those obtained from experimental observation. This confirms the validity of Eq. (8) indirectly. Fig.2(a) shows the effect of contact angles on droplet nucleation density on surfaces without a coating layer is small except on a subcooled surface having a large contact angle and at small degrees of subcooling. It is shown that the droplet nucleation density decreases as the contact angle increases. At large contact angles, the droplet nucleation radius become large, indicating that the onset of droplet condensation is more difficult to occur. Conse- quently, the number of activated condensation sites decreases. For large degree of subcooling, the nucleation potential aggrandizes,the radius of condensation droplets becomes smaller and more droplet nucleation sites are activated. It should be noted that for contact angle smaller than 90¡ã, droplet nucleation density curves shown in Fig. 2(a) are close with each other. This is because the droplet nucleation radius for h < 90¡ã is close to each other, which was explained in the preceding paper. Fig. 2(b) shows the effect of contact angle on droplet nucleation density on a coating layer having a thickness of d = 0.1 lm and a thermal conductivity  kcoat = 0.25 W/m-K. A comparison of Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows that addition of a coating layer decreases the droplet nucleation density greatly. Effects of thickness and thermal conductivity of coating layers on droplet nucleation density is presented in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. The results show that droplet nucleation density decreases on a thicker coat- ing layer with a smaller thermal conductivity.
    The proposed improved model for dropwise condensation heat transfer rate is given by Eq. (1) with qdrop given by Eq. (2a) with rmin being replaced by rc, i.e., where n(r) and N(r) are given by Eqs. (3a) and (5a) respectively with rmin being replaced by rc, the critical radius rc determined from Eq. (6b), the coalescence radius re determined from Eq. (4a) and with droplet nucleation density Ns determined from Eq.(8), respectively. Fig. 3 is a comparison of the predicated condensation heat transfer based on the improved dropwise condensation model with existing experimental data obtained by different investigators. Since information on the contact angle was not reported in their experimental data, three contact angles (h=60¡ã, 90¡ã and 120¡ã) were chosen for computations in the proposed model and the results are compared with the experimental data. In compari- son with the present theory, the mean absolute percentage error of the experimental data are 34.8%, 17.9% and 21.9% if the contact angle of  h=60¡ã, 90¡ã, or 120¡ã, were used for computation respectively. Fig. 4 shows the effect of contact angle on the predicted drop- wise condensation heat flux  at a specific degree of subcooling of 4 ¡ãC. It can be seen that the condensation heat flux firstly increases with the contact angle to a maximum value at about h=120¡ã and then decreases afterward. This behavior with respect to h can be seen from the three terms in downstairs of Eq. (2a) for a hydrophilic surface (h < 90¡ã) and a hydrophobic surfaces (h > 90¡ã) respectively. For a hydrophilic surface (h < 90¡ã), all of the three terms decrease with the contact angle, and thus, the condensation heat flux increases with the contact angle. For a hydrophobic surface (h > 90¡ã), heat transfer rate qdrop decreases because the  increase in first two terms (i.e., thermal resistance of coating, and conduction in the droplet) in downstairs is larger than the decrease of the third term (i.e., the interfacial thermal resistance) and consequently the condensation heat flux decreases. For the above reason, Fig. 4 shows that an optimal contact angle exists for max- imum dropwise condensation heat flux for a given degree of subcooling. The contact angle hysteresis, defined as ha hr, also influences dropwise condensation heat flux because it affects the movement of the droplet. With small contact angle hysteresis, the maximum drop radius decreases as shown in Eq. (5b), suggesting that droplets are easier to move. The effect of contact angle hysteresis on dropwise condensation is given in Fig. 5. In the calculation, the receding contact angle hr and advancing contact angle ha is estimated as. Fig. 5 shows that condensation heat flux is much larger at low contact angle hysteresis than at high contact angle hysteresis. Fig. 6 shows the effect of contact angle on dropwise condensa- tion heat flux on subcooled surfaces having a coating with thick- ness  d = 0.1 lm  and  thermal  conductivity  kcoat = 0.25 W/m-K. It can be seen that the dropwise condensation heat flux firstly increases with the contact angle, then decreases for hydrophobic surfaces, a trend similar to Fig. 4 (without a coating). It is shown from Fig.6 that the maximum condensation heat flux occurs at about h = 90¡ã with a promoter coating, which is smaller  than at h= 120¡ã on a surface without a coating layer as shown in Fig. 4. This is because the first term (i.e., thermal resistance ofcoating) in Eq. (7) decreases for 0 < h < 90¡ã  but  increases for 90¡ã < h < 180¡ã, leading to the shift of optimum contact angle to be smaller from h = 120¡ã to h = 90¡ã at maximum qdrop. Fig.7 shows the effect of thicknesses and thermal conductivities of the coating surface on condensation heat transfer. The results show that thermal resistance increases with a thick coating surface having a low thermal conductivity, so that dropwise condensation heat flux is reduced under such situations. Fig. 8 shows the effect of saturated pressures on predicted dropwise condensation heat flux on subcooled surfaces without a coating layer at h = 90¡ã. It can be seen that dropwise condensation heat flux increases with the saturated pressure. This is because the nucleation radius is smaller at higher saturated pressures as shown in the preceding paper. When the nucleation radius is small, the nucleation density is high, so dropwise condensation heat flux increases at high saturated pressures.
Fig. 9 shows that predicted condensation heat fluxes are in good agreement with Stylianou and Rose¡¯s experimental data at different saturated pressures. The contact angle of h = 90¡ã was chosen for computation in this model because the contact angle was not reported in their paper.

Concluding remarks
     In this paper, an improved model is proposed for dropwise condensation heat flux on a subcooled surface with coatings, where embryo droplet nucleation radius and droplet nucleation density are evaluated differently from existing models. This improved model differs from Kim and Kim model in two important aspects: (i) the droplets nucleation radius is evaluated from the preceding paper instead of the critical radius given by Eq. (2c). (ii) The droplet nucleation density is calculated from the analytical expression given by Rose with the critical radius computed from the preceding paper instead of experimental values. Effects of contact angle, degree of subcooling, contact angle hysteresis, thickness and thermal conductivity of promoter coating layer as well as saturated pressure on dropwise condensation heat transfer are presented. The following conclusions can be drawn from this paper:
     An analytical expression for critical condensation heat transfer rate at onset of dropwise condensation is obtained in this paper for the first time. At a given degree of subcooling, this condensation heat transfer rate increases with the contact angle.
    The validity of Rose¡¯s analytical expression for droplet nucleation density is confirmed by a more accurate calculation of critical radius for onset of dropwise condensation, with effects of coating, interfacial temperature drop, and curvature depression of equilibrium interface temperature taken into consideration.
    Increasing degree of subcooling within certain limits can diminish embryo droplet nucleation radius, magnifying droplet nucleation density and increasing the dropwise condensation heat flux.
    The dropwise condensation heat flux increases with the contact angle of hydrophilic surfaces at first, then decreases at high contact angles of hydrophilic surfaces. An optimal contact angle for dropwise condensation heat transfer exists for a given degree of subcooling.
    Although a hydrophobic coating layer can enhance dropwise condensation heat transfer, it also introduces an extra thermal resistance to the condensation heat transfer process. A thin hydrophobic coating layer with a high thermal conductivity can aggrandize droplet nucleation density and enhance dropwise condensation heat transfer greatly.
    Both the condensation heat flux and droplet nucleation density increase at higher saturation pressures.Effects  of wall  temperature on slagging and  ash  deposition of Zhundong coal  during circulating fluidized bed  gasification

a b s t r a c t  ：
Zhundong coal  with a large reserve is faced severe ash-related problems including slagging and fouling during pulverized-coal boiler combustion. The  gasification in  circulating fluidized bed is a good way to use Zhundong coal  due to the low  reaction temperature, while it is  unknown for  the slagging and ash deposition mechanism of Zhundong coal  during circulating fluidized bed gasification. In this paper, the gasification of  Zhundong coal  was tested in  a 0.4 t/d CFB test rig  simulating the real industrial device. Ash  deposition probes were installed along the gas  flow  direction to characterize its  slagging and ash deposition at different wall temperatures. These probes were treated with three cooling methods (no cooling, air  cooling or  water cooling) to reach different wall temperatures (882–737, 665–429 and 81–45 °C). The  results reveal that deposition was affected greatly by  wall temperature.  Mineral elements including Na, Ca, Fe, Al and Si were likely to accumulate in  deposits on  high-temperature  surfaces, and existed in  the forms of  silicates and sulfates at wall temperature  above 882 °C, resulting in slagging. Although the contents of most mineral elements in  the deposits on  cooled surfaces were always low,  a large gas-wall temperature gradient triggered the condensation of  gaseous species, such as  Na,  Cl and K. The  CaSO4  and CaO in  gases were condensed and restructured in  an  ordered crystalline array on  the surfaces of ash particles, forming a coating layer that made the ash particles stickier. Chemical composi- tion and crystallographic analyses show that the properties of deposits on the probes and gas-borne ashes were different. More mineral phases as well as sodium were present in deposits. Additionally, due to the Cl enrichment on  air-cooled surfaces, the corrosion of the metal surfaces should be  focused.
1. Introduction
The Zhundong coalfield, which is a very  large coal  deposit still under exploration, is potentially an important coal mining resource in  West China  [1].  The  coal  reserves in  this coalfield were esti- mated to  be  390  Gt. The  high volatile content, low  ash  and sulfur contents, and high reactivity make Zhundong coal  a potential sup-ply   of  gas   fuels,   liquid  fuels,   hydrogen, electricity, and  other chemical materials. However,  due to  the insufficient understand- ing of its characteristics, the utilization of Zhundong coal  is limited by  the occurrence of  severe slagging and fouling [2,3].  To better understand  and  resolve these  two  problems,  researchers  have tested Zhundong coal  extensively, but mostly in  laboratory-scale furnaces [2,4–8]. The main cause for slagging and fouling of Zhun- dong coal is attributed to the richness of alkali-alkaline earth metal (AAEM) elements, particularly Na.
Na  affects slagging and fouling mainly in  two aspects: (1)  its high chemical reactivity with other minerals leads to  formation of  eutectics  [3,4,9] and  (2)  it  is  strongly prone to  sublimation [2–4,8]. Na in  the coal  may also  be  involved in  complex transfor- mation reactions and partially ends up  in  the form of  silicates and sulfates. At melting temperature below 1000 °C, sodium sili- cates would mix  with iron,  calcium, or magnesium oxides to form eutectics. These eutectics easily adhere  to  and slag  in  the coal burners of industrial pulverized coal-fired boilers [10].  Moreover, they cover the surfaces of bed  materials or  ash  particles to  form adhesive coating layers, leading to  agglomeration or  even de- fluidization [9,11,12]. Additionally, during thermal coal conversion, Na is easily released through fast  de-volatilization. The Na vapors will nucleate/condense to form sticky fine particles, thus accelerat- ing the ash deposition in the boilers [2,4]. In Zijing bituminous coal, a  type of  Zhundong coal  containing 12.77 wt% Na2O  in  coal  ash, volatilized Na content was  maintained at 20–55 wt% during com- bustion at 400–1000 °C, in  which Na  volatilization was  kept at a high  level   within  600–900 °C  [8].   Volatilized  Na   will   adhere, through  sulfation [10]   or  condensation, to  the  heated surfaces and other ash  particles to  form a  sticky inner layer on  the bare heating surfaces or to form a sticky coating surface of bulk ash  par- ticles, which are  considered as two necessary aspects of ash  depo- sition [4].  Therefore, the existing research is  focused on  the Na release and transformation during the high-Na coal  thermal con- version [8,13–15]. To date, the most effective resolution in indus- trial  boilers  is   co-combustion  with  other  coals  [2,16].  Some additives, such as clay [11,17], kaolin [6] and gibbsite [17], are used to  restrain agglomeration during the fluidized bed  combustion  of high-alkali coal.  These Al-rich additives could react  with  Na  to form high-melting-point aluminosilicates, partly restraining foul- ing  and slagging.
Recently, there are  some studies about the slagging and fouling of Zhundong coal.  The sintering experiments of Zhundong coal  ash under an  O2/CO2   atmosphere in  a  laboratory-scale sintering furnace (over 1200 °C) show that all sintered coal  ashes were layered in different colors [5].  The  relative contents of Si, Ca, Al and Fe in the oxyfuel combustion atmosphere were all different compared with the air-firing atmosphere. During pulverized coal  combustion of high-Na lignite in  a 25 kW  down-fired furnace, Zhundong coal slagged significantly around 1150 °C on  the walls near the burner inlet due to  the formation of  low-melting-temperature  wollastonite and other eutectic mixtures [4]. The mechanism how AAEM species  accelerate  ash   deposition  can   be   summarized  in   two aspects: (1) formation of a sticky inner layer on the bare tube surface and (2) formation of a sticky coating surface of bulk ash  particles.  Wang et al. investigated the mechanisms underlying the Ca/ Na/S/Cl  transformation and ash  deposition in  both full-scale and laboratory-scale furnaces, and found sulfate condensation at about
850  °C was  pivotal in ash  deposition [2]. Wu et al. reported the ash deposition behaviors of  Zhundong coal  in  a  3 MWth   pilot plant facility, and found the Fe-/Ca-bearing minerals and sulfates promoted slagging and ash  deposition [18].  However, among these studies, the most recent work was  carried out  at high temperature (over 1000 °C) during combustion of Zhundong coal.  As reported, ash   deposition  on   convective heat  transfer  surfaces could be cleaned using the conventional soot-blowers by  controlling the flue  gas  inlet temperature [19].  Due  to  low  reaction temperature of  CFB, the reduction of  low-temperature eutectics might remit the slagging and ash  deposition of  Zhundong coal.  Thus,  CFB is highly potential  for   utilization of  high-sodium  Zhundong  coal. We  previously investigated the Na transformation during gasification/combustion [20]  and compared the slagging behaviors among three types of Zhundong coal containing different sodium contents in a 0.25  t/d CFB test rig [21].  It was  found Na behaved differently under these two reaction atmospheres: Na  migrated from Zhundong coal  to deposit mainly in the form of Na2SO4  during combustion, but in the form of NaCl during gasification. The properties of Zhundong  coal  exploited  from  different  coalfields  vary  consider-ably.  Such  variation is contributed to the formation of morpholog- ically  different slags,   in  which the Na/Si  ratio in  Zhundong coal plays a very  important role.  Zhundong coal  with high volatile con- tent is a good  gasification fuel. Gasifying Zhundong coal by CFB and gradient  utilization  of   the  gas   and  gasified  fly   ash   are   new attempts. A series of studies are  needed to  realize these attempts. To date, there is  rare research about Zhundong coal  gasification and even less  report about the effects of wall  temperature on slagging  and deposition during CFBG of Zhundong coal.
In this work, the CFBG of a type of Zhundong coal  was  tested in a 0.4 t/d CFB test rig. The slags  and deposits were sampled by ash deposition probes, whose temperatures were controlled by  water or  air  in  order to  reach different wall   temperatures. To  further reveal the mechanisms of  slagging and fouling, we  analyzed the morphology, chemical compositions and crystalline phase of both slags  and deposits. The aim  of this work is to characterize the slagging  and ash  deposition during CFBG of Zhundong coal  and to pro- vide  guidance for  industrial application of  Zhundong coal  in  the future.
2. Experimental

2.1. Materials

The proximate and ultimate analyses as well  as ash  composition of Zhundong coal  are  presented in Table  1. The relatively low  ash and high volatile contents make Zhundong coal  suitable for gasification, but the high Na2O content in ash  (up  to 7.28%) indicates the possible occurrence of slagging and ash  deposition during gasification. The  experimental coal  was  sieved to  the size  of 0.1–1.0 mm before each experiment.
The important role  of Al2O3  in inhibition of de-fluidization has been reported  extensively [6,11,17]. Thus,  Al-enriched bed  mate- rial containing 90.05% Al2O3  and 7.69% SiO2  was  used in this study, which was  sieved to  0.18–0.71 mm.


2.2. Test system

The  gasification experiments were undertaken in  a 0.4 t/d CFB test rig (inner diameter 150  mm; height 4.4 m).  The test rig  (brief schematic showed in Fig. 1) has  a coal  feeding rate of 0.4 t/d.
The  test system is equipped with thermocouples and differential  pressure sensors along the riser height. Its  main pipelines are coated with high-temperature-resistant cotton in  order to  minimize heat loss during operation. The fuel was  ignited at the startup stage by the external heating provided by heating wires.
All of the data, including temperature, pressure and air volume- flow  rate, were collected and displayed real-time by  a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) data acquisition system.

2.3. Sampling system and  analyses

For a better comparison, the T1-measured bed  temperature was stabilized at ~935 °C for  ~8 h  in  each test. The  details of experimental conditions are  shown in Table  2.
Ashes  were sampled from positions P1–P9 as  shown in  Fig. 1. Ashes  in  positions P1–P4 were sampled by  sampling cans, which were each controlled by a valve independently. Ashes  in positions P5–P8 were  collected by  temperature-controlled ash   deposition probes (schematic diagram illustrated in Fig. 1) cooled by different media (e.g.  air,  water or  nothing), and were used to  characterize the coal slagging and fouling. The inner and outer surfaces of probe walls were each installed with a  thermocouple to  measure wall temperatures.  The   two  thermocouple-measured temperatures were averaged to  be  the wall  temperature of  the corresponding probe. The  probes are  composed of a fine  heat-resistant material– stainless steel Cr25Ni20 (GB/T20878-2007).
Ashes  in position P9 were collected by  an  ash  sampling probe, which was  purged by  N2  in  advance. This  operation ensures the sampling is valid.  Before  the condition stabilized, the ash  sampling probe contained a large amount of unwanted ash.  To collect more valid  ash,  purging the sampling probe must be  carried out.  Mean-while, N2, an inert gas, has  no effect on the atmosphere around the ash. The gas composition in position P4 was  also  detected by a portable infrared gas  analyzer (Gasboard-3100P).
The  microtopography of the samples and element distribution at some interest  points were analyzed on  a  scanning electron microscope with an  energy dispersive X-ray  spectrometer  (SEM- EDX;  S-4800, Hitachi,  Japan). The  compounds of  samples were detected on  an  X-ray  diffractometer (XRD; PANalytical, Nether- lands). The  chemical components of  some samples were deter- mined via  an  X-ray  fluorescence meter (XRF, XRF-1800,  Japan).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Deposition tendency at  different wall  temperatures

According to the gas  properties shown in Table  3, it is believed that the ash  deposition probes for the three tests were maintained at almost the same reducing atmosphere.
Since   the experimental conditions were similar among the three tests, the temperature curves along the rise  (T1–T5) coincided  perfectly  (Fig.  2).  The   wall   temperatures  were  different among the adiabatic, air-cooled and water-cooled probes. Under the action of  thermal radiation, the thermocouple-measured gas temperatures were affected by  the cooled probes. Thus,  the temperature  difference was   enlarged gradually from position P5  to P8 (i.e. T6, T7, T9 and T10).
The  wall  temperatures varied among the adiabatic,  air-cooled and water-cooled probes owing to the different thermal conductivities of the cooling media. For the uncooled probe which could be considered as adiabatic, the wall  temperatures in positions P5–P8 ranged  from 882   to   737  °C  (Fig. 3a),   which were  only   several degrees to  dozens of  degrees lower than the corresponding gas temperatures  (891–774 °C).  The   wall   temperatures  of  the  air- cooled and water-cooled probes were 665–429 °C and 81–45 °C, respectively, which were largely lower compared with the adiabatic case.
The ash  deposition probes along the gas flow direction are  illustrated in Fig. 3b. The amount and morphology of deposits both differ among probe types and change with wall  temperature. A small amount of slags  is found only  on the adiabatic probe in position P5, but fine  ash  particles are  evenly distributed on  the surfaces of the two cooled probes in positions P5 and P6. It is indicated the cooled probes can  capture more ash  particles than the adiabatic one.  The deposited amounts on each probe increase gradually from position P5 to  P8.
Slagging and ash  deposition are  affected by  the adhesion force between  heating surfaces and  ash   components,  especially  Na- based compounds [22].  The  ash  particles on  the probes certainly contain viscous materials that melt easily at ~900 °C, such as silicates and sulfates [9,23]. The  gaseous alkali metal elements after approaching the cooled surfaces would be  condensed to  be  adhesive   among ash   particles,  thereby  promoting deposition [4].  In the two cooled cases, fine  ash  particles were transported by  thermophoresis, a phenomenon in which fine or aerosol particles move against the temperature gradient and ultimately deposit on  low-temperature surfaces.
The formation of a fouling layer on a probe aggravated the thermal  resistance and thereby decreased heat flux.  The  heat flux reduction was  reflected by  the temperature change. However, because of the small amount of deposits on the probes, the temperature changes were not  obviously different among the three cases. Therefore, the temporal variation of temperature only  in  position P8  under the air-cooling condition is  illustrated in  Fig. 4,  where G/WT  is  the gas/wall temperature around/of the ash  deposition probe in position P8, and DT is the temperature difference between them. Generally, the temperatures  in  position P8  including gas temperature and wall  temperature varied slightly, which is consistent with the small thickness of  the fouling layer. At  the initial deposition stage, the wall  and gas  temperatures tended to  rise  to a thermal equilibrium with smaller difference between them. As ash  deposition continued, the thermal resistance was   enhanced, leading to  the decrease of  wall  temperature  and the increase of temperature  difference. With the progression of  deposition, the contact area between ash  particles was  enlarged and the deposits became dense. In  consequence, the thermal conductivity was increased [24].  Thus,  at the final  depositing stage, the wall  temperature rose  slightly again and the temperature  difference was diminished.
3.2. Microstructure and  crystalline phase  of deposits

Fig. 5 shows the micro-morphology and element distribution of deposits on the probes in position P5. Granular slags  appear on the adiabatic probe (Fig. 3b)  and are  covered with obvious melting as indicated by  SEM image. EDX shows that large amounts of Ca, Si, Na, Fe and S are  distributed on  the slag  surfaces, indicating these elements are  fluxing materials [4,5,25,26]. The  agglomerated and melted particles are  primarily formed from eutectic compounds, silicates and (composite) sulfates, which reduce the melting point of deposits. Special attention should be  paid to  iron,  which functions as a flux agent during the deposition. In addition, no chlorine is found on the particles, indicating it is still  gaseous at 882  °C. The major mineral phases of  the slags,   detected by  crystallographic analysis, are  SiO2, Al2O3, Ca2Al2SiO7  and Na2Al2Si3O10 (Fig. 6). The Al-rich material  used in  these experiments effectively captured sodium  to   form  high-melting-temperature  refractory  minerals [27,28]. However, the further increase of sodium atop the Al-rich grains would convert these refractory minerals to fluxing minerals. It could be  deduced that an  interaction between sodium and Al- rich  bed  materials occurred from surfaces inward to the inner part, just like  the interpenetration between Na2O in Zhundong coal  and quartz sands (SiO2) [21].  The dominant component inside the gran- ular salgs  was  still  Al2O3. Thus,  the presence of Al2O3  in the granular  slags  indicates it served as a skeleton of slagging. Ca2Al2SiO7, a common fluxing material in the slags  of Zhundong coal,  tended to appear at high temperature [5,24]. Na2Al2Si3O10 resulted from the reaction among Na-based compounds, SiO2  and Al2O3.  Formation of Al-containing compounds indicates that high sodium in  Zhundong coal  could consume Al gradually. In addition, many sodium compounds were still   not   detected by  XRD because of  the low crystallinity.
Na-  and  Si-rich particles  also   appear in  the deposits of  the air-cooled probe  in  position  P5  (Fig. 5b).   These particles were considered to  reserve strong viscosity at the gas  temperature  of
903  °C, like  under the adiabatic condition. However,  no  slagging occurred, indicating slagging was  inhibited by  the low  wall  temperature (~665 °C). One  explanation is  that those agglomerated and melted particles became less  viscous once they contacted with the low-temperature walls. The  weakened viscosity is  unable to produce enough adhesion force  that can  prevent the fall-off of particles from the  probe induced by  the  airflow collision or  self- weight. As  reported, the deposited ashes became heavier with the rise  of  probe temperature through a  drop tube furnace [25], which was  attributed to  the higher viscosity of the ashes on  the higher-temperature  surfaces.
A large amount of  fine  particles were adsorbed onto the surfaces  of both the air-  or water-cooled probes due to  the temperature gradient (Fig.  5).  These cooled surfaces were a  good   home for  volatile components. Fig. 5c  shows the SEM-EDX results of an ash  particle sampled from the water-cooled probe in  position P5. Despite small amounts of Ca, Si, Fe and S on  the surfaces, the Na and Cl contents are  still  very  high (9.05% and 13.54% respectively) compared with Fig. 5a.  Volatilized-Na content  was   up  to  50% at 900 °C,  and Cl  was   more  volatile [8].  It  is  believed that  large
amounts of Na and Cl are  still  gaseous at about 900 °C. These gaseous components were condensed on  the surfaces of the fine  particles absorbed by the cooled probes. The Na/Cl molar ratio on the particle surfaces is 1.03,  meaning a high possibility of Na  and Cl being condensed to  NaCl. The  Cl enrichment is a potential threat to  the metal heating surfaces [29].  The  condensed Na  severs as an  adhesive between fine  particles. 
Fig.  7  shows an  ash   particle with a  coating layer. The  local amplification shows that the smaller particles lean on  each other orderly and closely to  form a coating layer. EDX shows abundant Ca and S appear on the layer surfaces, indicating a higher probability that the smaller particles are  composed of CaSO4. Moreover, the Ca/S atomic ratio is 1.80  in area 2 and 1.65  in area 3, which means still a large amount of Ca exists in other forms. CaO is the most possible form in  addition to  CaSO4.  Chemical fractionation analysis shows that 66.6% of Ca in  Zhundong coal  is organically bounded [4] and this part of Ca is decomposed to oxides at low  temperature (<900 °C) [30].  At the reducing condition, another possible form of Ca is atom, which, together with CaO and CaSO4, is released from the raw coal  into gases. These components, when meeting low- temperature  surfaces or  when at low  gas  temperature, are  condensed to an ordered crystalline array on the surfaces of ash  particles.  These calcium species deposited  on  the surfaces of  fly  ash particles, making the ash  particles on  the heating surfaces stickier [2].  Under the combustion conditions, the clusters of  fine  CaSO4 particles  were  also   observed at  the  flue   gas   temperature   of 507  °C, in which the CaSO4  was  considered to  result from the sulfation of CaO [3].
3.3. Property changes of deposits along  the  gas flow direction

The morphologies of slags  and deposits along the gas flow direction are reflected by chemical compositions, which are related with the decreasing temperature [2].  As shown in  Fig. 8, the chemical compositions of the deposits change with temperature in different ways among the three conditions. For the adiabatic condition, the top  two elements in most deposits are  Ca and S, corresponding to the Ca- and S-rich raw coal.  This  indicates that CaSO4  contributes to  the deposition. With the temperature drop, Na,  Fe, Ca, Si and Al contents were all reduced from position P5 to  P8, especially in the interval from P5 to P7, i.e. the wall  temperature decreases from
882  to 804  °C. In contrast, the contents of other elements such as Cl and K were the lowest (~0) in position P5, and increased with the decreasing wall  temperature, which indicates Cl and K were gaseous at 882  °C and began to  condense below 804  °C. The  S, Ca, Fe and Mg contents decreased, but were still  higher than those under the air/water cooling conditions in  the corresponding positions.
Thus,  it is believed that S, Ca, Fe and Mg are  more likely  to  enrich on  the high-temperature surfaces.
Additionally, under the adiabatic condition, Na, Al, Si, S, Ca and Fe  contents in  the deposits were all  maximized at position P5 under all the three conditions, which explains the distinctive morphology. As reported, the ash  richer in Ca, Fe and Mg melted more easily [25].  When approaching high-temperature surfaces, these elements formed surface-adhering eutectic compounds which then combined with the strongly affinitive S to form low-melting- temperature sulfates.
Under the air-cooling condition, the Fe and Al contents declined with the decreasing temperature, but were maintained at lower levels compared with Ca, S, Si and Mg. Moreover, the contents of Na, Cl and K all increased much with the decreasing temperature, probably because they tend to  condense on  cooled surfaces [2]. Fe, Ca, S, Si, Al and Mg contents under the water-cooling condition were all lower compared with the other two conditions, suggesting there  is   no   temperature-dependent   regularity  below  100 °C.
However, the wall  temperature below 100 °C could still  stimulate the condensation of Na, Cl and K.
The above discussion suggests that the properties of the deposits changed significantly along the gas flow  direction. Especially at high  wall    temperature   (882–737 °C),  mineral  elements  were enriched more easily on  these surfaces. With the decrease of wall temperature,  Na,  Cl and K contents increased modestly, but the contents of most other mineral elements decreased evidently. In a  biomass furnace, medium-heated  surfaces below 900 °C were the major regions for  deposition [31],  which is  consistent with the fact  that the largest changes of mineral contents occurred at
882–804 °C.
The  changes of mineral phases in ashes with the gas  temperature were investigated via  XRD. Due  to  small number of samples, no   deposits  in   positions  P5–P7 were  detected  by   XRD.  Thus, Fig. 9 only  shows the XRD patterns of ash  samples from positions P4 and P9, whose major mineral phases are  CaSO4  and CaO, which is consistent with Fig. 7. Na4SiO4  and MgO were only  detected in  ash   samples from position P4,  indicating these mineral species were probably captured by  metal surface to s from position P4  P9. Since  Na, Ca, and Mg were more inclined to  reside in fine  particles [32],  the fine  ash  particles escaping from the cyclone were rich  in alkali metal compounds. These fine  particles adhered onto metal surfaces to  form the initial ash  deposition layer [33].  Especially   among  minerals,   the  presence of  alkali sulfates  greatly enhanced the adhesion force  between ash  and metal surfaces [22].
3.4. Differences  between ash  and  deposits 
Deposits originated from the fly ash  particles in  gases. To further understand the mechanism of deposition, we  compared the properties between deposits and fly  ash.  The  ash  at position P4, which fell  into the sampling can  gravitationally, was  representative  of  the fly  ash  in  the flue  gas.  The  chemical compositions  of ash  and deposits are  shown in  Fig. 10.  In these experiments, the contents of S, Ca and Fe all increased with the rise  of wall  temperature.  Especially, the  contents  of   these  elements  in   deposits exceeded those in  ash   only   under  the adiabatic condition. This indicates  that  S,   Ca   and  Fe   migrated   easily  to    the  high- temperature surfaces, but hardly to the low-temperature surfaces. As  reported,  alkali metal  compounds selectively adhered  and deposited onto metal surfaces [33].  Na,  K and Cl in  all  deposits (especially the air-cooled deposits) were more sufficient than those in  ash,  which proves that the corresponding gaseous components or fly ash  particles enriched in Na, K and Cl would gather on metal surfaces. Since  the air-cooling condition is  similar to  the actual industrial boiler, attention should be  paid to  the Cl-caused corrosion   of  deposits. Additionally,  alkali-metal-sulfate-caused  corrosion  might occur during the combustion of Zhundong coal  [34].
XRD reveals more mineral phases in deposits than in ash  (Figs. 9 and 11).  Besides CaSO4  and CaO detected in ash,  all deposits contain Ca2SiO4,  Ca3Mg(SiO4)2,  MgO  and NaCl.  The  presence of NaCl in deposits further proves that Na and Cl are  condensed in the form of  NaCl.  Ca3Mg(SiO4)2,  which resulted from the reaction among SiO2, MgO and CaO, was  also  detected in Zhundong coal  ash  under an oxyfuel  combustion  atmosphere  [5].   Ca3Mg(SiO4)2     would decompose to  Ca2SiO4  at ~1200 °C.
At 600 °C, the CaCO3   in  coal  would decompose to  CaO, which reacts with other mineral species to  form more complex minerals[2,5].  CaO in adiabatic deposits shows a lower XRD peak and thus is very  reactive with other mineral compared with that in  cooled deposits. Additionally, low  wall  temperature prevented the participation of SiO2  and Al2O3  during other chemical reactions, resulting in  their high XRD intensities in  water-cooled deposits. The  presence of Na4SiO4   in  deposits on  both the adiabatic and air-cooled probes indicates that high temperature surfaces could easily capture sodium silicates.
In  general, more mineral phases are  present in  deposits, and mineral elements such as  S, Ca  and Fe  are   prone to  enrich on high-wall-temperature  surfaces. Attention should be  paid to  chlorinous corrosion under the air-cooling condition.

4. Conclusions

The effects of wall  temperature on  slagging and ash  deposition during circulating fluidized bed  gasification of Zhundong coal were investigated. The main conclusions are  listed below.

(1)  Deposition was  greatly affected by  wall  temperature.  Slagging  occurred on  the surfaces at above 882  °C. As the gas- wall  temperature gradient was  enlarged, fine  particles were captured and deposited onto cooled surfaces. Deposition affected wall   temperature in  return and thus destabilized the heat flux.
(2)  The enrichment of Ca, Si, Na, Fe and S was  the main cause of slagging on  the high-temperature  surfaces. Volatile species such as  NaCl were condensed on  cooled surfaces and thus contributed to  deposition. Ca was   condensed and restructured in an ordered array to form a coating layer on ash  particle  surfaces, making ash  particles stickier.
(3)  The  contents of  mineral elements decreased along the gas flow  direction. The largest content changes occurred within the wall  temperature of 882–804 °C. The  contents of these elements were always low  at below 737  °C. However, gaseous Na,  Cl and K were condensed to  deposits along the gas  flow  direction.
(4)  The properties of deposits and ash  were very  different. More mineral phases were present in  deposits. Mineral elements such  as   S,  Ca  and  Fe  tended  to   enrich  in   deposits  on higher-wall-temperature  surfaces. Attention should be  paid to  chlorinous corrosion under air-cooling condition.


      Effects of electric fields on onset of dropwise condensation based on Gibbs free energy and availability                                                                                       analyses

Abstact
    A thermodynamic model based on changes in Gibbs free energy and availability is developed in this paper for onset of condensation of supersaturated or saturated vapor under electric fields. Both homogeneous condensation and heterogeneous condensation on subcooled surfaces are considered. Effects of contact angle, subcooled wall temperature and the strength of the electric field on heterogeneous condensation are illustrated. The results of these analyses show that an electric field can decrease the critical radius and promote onset of droplet condensation in a supersaturated or saturated vapor.

Introduction
    As early as in 1871, Thomson performed an analysis on thermodynamic equilibrium of vapor liquid interface with curvature and gave the initial form of Kelvin's equation, which describes the critical radii for onset of droplet condensation. Based on a grand potential analysis, Vorob'ev and Malyshenko concluded that external electric fields stimulated both bubble nucleation and onset of condensation. Warshavsky and Shchekin studied uniform electric field's effects on droplet shape and analyzed the change of chemical potential and the work required for droplet formation, and they proved that electric fields enhanced onset of droplet condensation. Gao et al. Used Monte Carlo method to simulate onset of condensation under two conditions: they found that an electric field promoted onset of condensation under the condition of fixed vapor chemical potential, but it prohibited onset of condensation under the condition of fixed temperature or pressure. All of these papers focused on effects of electric fields on onset of condensation in an environment with uniform temperature. 
    In this paper, we study the effect of an electric field on heterogeneous droplet condensation on a subcooled surface in a supersaturated or saturated vapor based on thermodynamic analyses, taking into consideration the wall temperature gradient and the contact angle of the subcooled surface. The critical radii for droplet condensation and bubble nucleation under the same degree of subcooling and superheat are first field is found to promote droplet condensation, which is in agreement with previous analyses. 

Onset of homogeneous condensation under an uniform electric field
    Consider the most simple case of homogeneous condensation in which droplet is condensed in a supersaturated vapor at a uniform temperature Tv and at a pressure pv, (which is higher than the saturated pressure ps corresponding to Tv) under an external imposed electric field.The chemical potential in a fluid under an external electric field with strength E can be written as. Where E is the strength of an imposed electric field, ¦Å is the dielectric constant of the fluid, ¦Í, ¦Ì, h, s are respectively the specific volume, the chemical potential, specific enthalpy and the specific entropy of the fluid. The change in specific Gibbs free energy after and before condensation is. where ¦Å and ¦Å are the dielectric constants of liquid and vapor respectively; El and Ev are the electric field strength imposed on liquid and vapor, respectively. The first term on the right hand of Eq. (2) can be calculated as: where Ts is the saturated temperature corresponding to vapor pressure pv; cpl and cpv are respectively specific heats of liquid and vapor at constant pressure, hlc and hvc are respectively the critical specific enthalpy of liquid and vapor at an equilibrium state where Tl = Tv. The second term on the right hand side of Eq. (2) can be calculated as. where hgf=fhfg is the latent heat from vapor phase to liquid phase; pl and pv are respectively the pressure inside and outside the liquid droplet.
Substituting Eqs. (3a), (3b), (3c) and (4) into Eq. (2) and setting El = where ¦¤T = Ts fTv N 0, ¦ÅL and ¦ÅG are the relative dielectric constant of liquid and vapor respectively, for which ¦Ål = ¦ÅL¦Å0 and ¦Åv = ¦ÅG¦Å0, with ¦Å0 = 8.85 ¡Á 1012 F/m being the vacuum permittivity. The relative dielectric constant of vapor ¦ÅG is regarded as a constant (which is listed in Table 1) and is independent of temperature. However, the relative dielectric constant of liquid is temperature dependent, which can be expressed as. It follows that the change in Gibbs free energy for the whole droplet is:where pl and pv are determined from the modified Young Laplace equation in an electric field. We can numerically calculate the critical radius for homogeneous condensation of droplet (rc1) at different electric field strengths by setting Eq.(7) equal to zero, i.e. The results of calculations, based on physical properties of water and water vapor listed in Table 1, are presented in Fig.1, where it can be seen that the critical radius for onset of homogeneous droplet condensation decreases with the imposed electric strength. If there is no electric field, i.e., E = 0, Eq.(10) with the aid of the Clausius Claperon equation gives, which is the Kelvin equation for critical radius for onset of homogeneous condensation of droplet. It is interesting to note that if Tv, pv, ¦Ñl in Eq. (11a) is replaced by Tl, pl, ¦Ñv, respectively, the resulting expression is identical to the critical radius for homogeneous bubble nucleation. Thus, expressions of critical radii for onset of homogeneous condensation of droplet and for homogeneous nucleation of bubble can be interchangeable after a simple substitution if the temperature of the environment is uniform. It is interesting to note from Eqs.(11a) and (11b) that the critical radius is inversely proportional to its initial phase's density respectively. The initial availability of the system (i.e., vapor at Tv and pv) can be expressed as. After droplet condensation occurs, the availability of the system with liquid, vapor and interface can be calculated as follow:It follows that the change in availability during homogeneous con- densation is the sum of Eqs. (13)¨C(15) minus Eq.(12) to give. Eq. (16) is presented in Fig. 2, where it can be seen that the peak value of availability change decreases with the electric field's strength. The peak value of availability represents the energy barrier of phase change because nature process will always tend to decrease the availability. Accordingly, the critical droplet radius (rc2) for onset of condensation of droplet can also be calculated as,  It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the condensation will have smaller energy barrier and smaller critical radius in a stronger electric field. This means that an electric field promotes homogeneous condensation of droplets. Fig. 3 shows changes in Gibbs free energy given by Eq. (7) and avail- ability given by Eq. (16) versus droplet radius during homogeneous condensation of droplet under the condition of Tv = 90 ¡ãC, Ts = 100 ¡ãC, and E =1 ¡Á 107 V/m. The two critical radii rc1 and rc2 in homogeneous condensation of droplet obtained respectively by Gibbs criteri marked in Fig.3. It can be seen that the critical radius obtained from ability criterion (rc2). It follows that Gibbs criterion is the necessary con-dition for onset of dropwise condensation, and the availability criterion is the sufficient condition. This conclusion is similar to those given by Dong et al for bubble nucleation. which is higher (or equal to) than the saturated pressure ps(Tv). It is assumed that: (i)The external electric field is uniform. (ii)The liquid droplet's temperature at height x is the same with the vapor temperature at the same height, i.e., Tv(x) = Tl(x) and temperature changes linearly from Tw to Ts, i.e. where Tv(xd) = Ts corresponds to the saturation temperature of the atmosphere vapor pressure. So, the temperature gradient k is: where xd is the height of the droplet, and ¦È is the contact angle of the substrate.
The temperature on top of the condensation droplet equals to the saturation temperature Ts corresponding to the environment vapor pressure at the onset of condensation; Next, consider the problem of onset of heterogeneous condensation of droplet on a wall (at x = 0) at a subcooled temperature Tw and with contact angle ¦È. Next to the wall is a semiinfinite extent of supersaturated (or saturated vapor) at a temperature Tv, and at a pressure pv
    The change in Gibbs free energy during heterogeneous condensa- tion of droplet on a subcooled wall can be obtained by integrating the specific Gibbs free energy change for the droplet's mass to give: where ¦¤T(x)= Ts Tv(x), ps(Ts) and ps(Tw) are the saturated pressures of water vapor corresponding to temperature Ts and Tw respectively. It should be noted that for the special case of ¦È = 180¡ã, Ts = Tw = Tv, ps(Tw) = ps, and ps(Ts) = pv, Eq. (20) will be reduced to the case of homogeneous condensation given by Eq. (7). According to Eq. (10), we can determine the critical radius (rc1) numerically. The results of this calculation for Tw=90 ¡ãC, Ts=100 ¡ãC and ¦È = 60¡ã are presented in Fig. 4, which shows that an electric field also promotes onset of heterogeneous condensation of droplets.
    The availability of initial state consists of the vapor phase and interface is: After condensation occurs, the availability of the system consisting of vapor, liquid and interface are given by: where the volume of the droplet and areas of interfaces are: and we can get the value of ¦Òlv¡ä from Eq. (9) for which the contact angle of the droplet under an electric field can be calculated as: Substituting Eqs. (25)¨C(29) in Eqs. (21)¨C(24), we can obtain the total availability change during heterogeneous condensation of droplets:
    Fig. 5 shows the change in availability during heterogeneous con- densation for Tw = 90 ¡ãC, Ts = 100 ¡ãC and ¦È = 60¡ã in different electric fields with strength of  0, 1 ¡Á 107 V/m and 4 ¡Á 107 V/m. It can be seen that the onset of condensation in a stronger electric field has a smaller energy barrier and a smaller critical radius, so an electric field also enhances onset of heterogeneous condensation of droplets. Fig. 6 shows the changes in Gibbs free energy and availability given by Eqs. (20) and (30) respectively during heterogeneous condensation of droplets for E =1 ¡Á 107 V/m, Ts = 100 ¡ãC, and Tw = 90 ¡ãC. Comparing this figure with homogeneous condensation under same conditions (E =1 ¡Á 107 V/m, Ts=100 ¡ãC, and; Tv = 90 ¡ãC, i.e., subcooling degree
to be 10 ¡ãC) shown in Fig. 3, it can be seen that the peak value of availability change in heterogeneous condensation of droplets in this figure is about 5 ¡Á 10^20 J, which is smaller than that of homogeneous condensation of droplets (about 4 ¡Á 10^19 J) shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding critical radius of heterogeneous condensation is about 1.2nm as compared to homogeneous condensation critical radius of 1.3nm. Thus, under an electric field, homogeneous condensation of droplets is more difficult to occur than heterogeneous condensation of droplets under the same temperature conditions.

Onset of heterogeneous condensation without electric fields
    We now consider the special case of heterogeneous condensation of droplets without an electric field. For this purpose, we set E = 0 in Eqs. (20) and (30) to give the changes in Gibbs free energy and availability for heterogeneous condensation of droplet on a subcooled substrate with temperature Tw and contact angle ¦È: Eqs. (31a) and (31b) versus the droplet radius are presented in Fig. 7, which shows changes in Gibbs free energy and availability during het- erogeneous condensation of droplets in a supersaturated (or saturated vapor) without an electric field. Setting Eq. (31a) equal to zero, the critical radius for the simple situation of onset of heterogeneous condensation of droplet with no electric field (E = 0) is simplified as. Setting ¦È = 180¡ã, Ts = Tw = Tv, ps(Tw) = ps, and ps(Ts) = pv in Eq. (32), the result will be reduced to the most simple case for homogeneous condensation given by Eq. (11a). The critical radius rc2 can be obtained from Eq.(31b) according to Eq. (17). It can be shown from Fig. 7 that the critical radius rc1 is less than the critical radius rc2 although the difference is small. It should be noted that Quan et al. have derived the following expression for critical radius for heterogeneous nucleation of bubble with no electric field (E = 0). Under no electric field, a comparison of critical radii for droplet condensation (with a subcooling of 10 ¡ãC) given by Eq. (32) and bubble nucleation (with a superheat of 10 ¡ãC) given by Eq. (33) is presented in Fig. 8. It is interesting to note that the critical radius for onset of droplet condensation is much smaller than the critical radius for onset of bubble nucleation because the density of liquid is much larger than that of vapor. Fig. 8 also shows that onset of droplet's critical radius increases with the contact angle, which means that condensation is more prone to occur on a hydrophilic surface. However, the critical radius for bubble nucleation decreases with the contact angle, meaning that boiling bubble is more prone to nucleate on a hydrophobic surface. From Eqs. (32) and (33) we note that the two expressions of critical radii for onset of  dropwise condensation and bubble nucleation are not identical, because the two processes of bubble and droplet formation are not exactly opposite. This is reflected in the changes in specific Gibbs free energy during heterogeneous condensation of droplets and heterogeneous nucleation of bubbles are not exactly the opposite. For the onset of heterogeneous condensation, the specific Gibbs free energy change is where pl is a function of radius and calculated by Young Laplace equation, ps (Ts) equals to the vapor pressure pv. For heterogeneous nucle- ation of bubbles, the specific Gibbs free energy change is: where pv is a function of radius and calculated by Young Laplace equation, ps (Ts) equals to the liquid pressure pl. The difference in specific Gibbs free energy's expressions for onset of condensation and boiling nucleation will lead to a difference in total Gibbs free energy changes, so the expressions for critical radii in these two cases are not exactly opposite.

Conclusions
    In this paper, we have developed a thermodynamic model to explore the electric field's influence on onset of condensation. Gibbs free energy analysis and availability analysis have been applied to obtain critical radii of dropwise condensation and the energy barrier for onset of condensation. From this analysis, the following conclusions are obtained:
    An electric field can promote onset of homogeneous heterogeneous condensation of droplets, reflecting in a decrease of both critical radius and nucleation energy barrier.
    Critical radii for onset of dropwise condensation have been obtained from Gibbs free energy criterion and availability criterion respectively. It is found that the former is always smaller than the latter, so Gibbs free energy criterion is the necessary condition while the availability criterion is the sufficient condition for onset of condensation. This conclusion for droplet condensation is similar to those given by Dong et al for bubble nucleation.
     Under the same temperature conditions and the same electric field, it is found that onset of homogeneous condensation is harder to occur than onset of heterogeneous condensation, reflecting in a higher energy barrier and a larger critical radius than heterogeneous condensation.Hydrogen production by  Zhundong coal gasification in supercritical water
Hui Jin*, Yunan Chen, Zhiwei Ge, Shanke Liu, Changsheng Ren, Liejin Guo
a b s t r a c t
The high sodium content of  Zhundong coal restricts its application in  direct combustion and supercritical water gasification is  a promising clean and efficient coal conversion technology. To obtain the gasification and sodium distribution characteristics of Zhundong coal in  supercritical water, experimental investigations were conducted in  autoclaves and supercritical water fluidized bed reactors. The experimental results showed that as the concentration of  Zhundong coal slurry decreased or  the residence time increased, more sodium was released from the solid phase in  autoclaves. Carbon gasification efficiency of more than 95% was obtained with the coal slurry of  30 wt%~40 wt%  in  the fluidized bed reactor. Less  than 0.07% sodium was released from the reactor, in other words, most of the sodium remaining could be  collected and caused no  pollution and fouling problems for downstream process. Supercritical water fluidized bed reactor appeared to  be a promising reactor for  supercritical water gasification of Zhundong coal.
Introduction

Coal  accounts for  the main part of energy resources in China and will  play a dominant role in  the next decades [1]. Direct combustion of coal in  the gas  phase has caused serious environmental pollution and safety problems. Zhundong coalfield has huge exploitable reserves of  164  Gt  [2,3],  how- ever, direct combustion of Zhundong coal is restricted for  its high alkali metal content. Because alkali metal lowers the ash fusion temperature and leads to  serious fouling and slagging on  the boiler water wall quickly [4e8].
Efficient and clean Zhundong coal utilization method is urgently needed and advanced coal conversion methods such as pyrolysis or  gasification were investigated  [9,10].  Much attention was paid to  the effect of sodium upon the gasification results and solid foundation was built for  the clean con- version  of   Zhundong   coal  [5,11e13].However traditional gasification and pyrolysis were conducted in  gas  phase, and sodium containing fly ash may exist in the raw gas. Therefore, special fly  ash separation device is  necessary to  prevent slagging problems. Supercritical water gasification technology attracts people's  attention due to  the unique chemical and physical properties of supercritical water [14e17]. Supercritical water provides a homogenous and rapid reacting medium for   clean  coal  conversion  [18e26]. The  main  conversion product is hydrogen, which is believed to  be  one of the most promising fuel in this century [27,28]. Moreover, the solubility of  inorganic matter in  supercritical water is  quite limited, which makes the  separation of  unwanted inorganic slats easier [29e33]. MODAR SCWO  [29] reactor used reverse-flow vessel to  recover the slats with a small steam at the bottom of the reactor. Vogel  [34] investigated the separation of inorganic salt in the process of biomass gasification to recover the salts as fertilizer and also avoid catalyst poisoning. Tester [35] discussed several commercial approaches that have been developed and/or used to control salt precipitation and solids buildup in SCWO systems. Cao [36,37] conducted supercritical water gasification of black liquid, and investigated the alkali recovery from supercritical water fluidized bed reactor. Therefore, supercritical water gasification might be  a good choice for  coal with high sodium content.
The element transformations were examined by  re- searchers. For example, the transformations of Pb, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Cr during the supercritical water treatment of used tires were studied by  Chen [38]. Nitrogen [39e41] and sulfur [42e44] transformation characteristics were investigated in the supercritical water environment from the point of view of pollution reduction. Su  [3] conducted the gasification of Zhundong  coal in   supercritical water  with a  quartz  tube reactor to  omit the unwanted catalytic effect of  the reactor wall and obtained a kinetic model for  Zhundong coal gasification. However, the distribution characteristics of  sodium were beyond the discussion. This manuscript investigated Zhundong coal gasification in  supercritical water with auto- claves and fluidized bed reactor, and attention was paid to the sodium transformation characteristics.
Materials and experimental method
Coal sample
Table 1  showed the elemental analysis and the proximate analysis of Zhundong coal. It can be  observed that the moisture content is  as high as 17.1%,  which also restricts the widespread application of Zhundong coal [15,45,46]. The coal ash analysis is  seen in  Table 2 and it  can be  seen that the sodium content is 3.40 wt%  and potassium content is 1.05 wt %. The coal particle size used in experiments was in the range of 75e150 mm.Apparatus  and experimental procedures Supercritical water gasification reactions were conducted in high-through autoclaves for  batch experiments and in  fluidized bed reactor system for  continuous experiments. The autoclave material  is   Hastelloy  C276.   The depth and the effective volume  of  the autoclave are 20  mm and 10  mL respectively. The designed temperature  and pressure of are 750℃ and 30  MPa  respectively. The average heating rate inside the reactor was about 70 o C/min. More details of  the autoclave were noted in the reference [17].
The fluidized bed reactor has supercritical water as fluid- izing agent. A  distributor made of  sintered metal with an average pore diameter of 50 mm is located in the bottom of the reactor. The sintered metal is provided by Northwest Institute for   Nonferrous  Metal  Research.  Water  preheated   to   the desired temperature flows through the distributor to  form a fluidization state [47,48].  Zhundong coal-water-slurry  flows into  the  reactor  above the  distributor.  The fluidized bed reactor is  constructed of  316  stainless steel and the design temperature and pressure are 700 o C and 30 MPa respectively. The inner diameter of the reactor is 40 mm, and the height of the reactor is 1650 mm.

Analytical methods and data interpretation

The composition of the gaseous products was analyzed by gas chromatography  (Agilent 7890A)  with thermal conductivity detectors (TCDs) and high-purity argon was used as the carrier gas. The yield of gas  was measured by wet gas flow meter. The determination of the sodium content in  the aqueous or solid sample was conducted in inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, IRIS Intrepid II, Thermo Scientific). Carbon gasification efficiency and hydrogen yield were selected to  evaluate the gasification characteristics and defined as follows [17]:
CE (Carbon gasification  Efficiency) ¼ (total carbon in  the gaseous products)/(total carbon in Zhundong coal)  × 100(%)
Gas  yield ¼ (molar amount of a certain component of the gaseous products)/(mass of Zhundong coal)  (mol/kg).
Results and discussion

Effect of concentration

High concentration means high handling capacity of Zhundong coal in reactors, however, high concentration of feed- stock may be  overloaded for a certain reactor. The effects of concentration upon Zhundong coal gasification results were investigated in autoclaves as seen in Fig. 1. When the concentration of Zhundong coal was 5 wt%, the main gas fraction (fraction is based on volume in the paper) was H2 and CO2 and their fractions were 56.86%  and 40.75%  respectively.  As the concentration increased from 5 wt% to 15 wt%,  the fraction of H2 decreased to  40.74%  and the fraction of CO2  increased to
36.29%.  It was  worth  mentioning  that  the  fraction  of  CH4
increased obviously from 7.54%  to 21.26%.  It was probable that high concentration of  coal means  low  content of  supercritical water molecules surrounding reactants, therefore the methanation reaction (R-1) was enhanced for  CH4  production. The increase of CH4 also increased the lower heating value of  the gaseous product for utilization based on combustion.
4H2  þ CO2 /CH4  þ 2H2 O 	(R-1) As  the concentration of  Zhundong coal increased  from
5 wt%  to 15 wt%,  the carbon gasification efficiency decreased sharply from 45.72%  to  29.85%,  and the hydrogen yield decreased from 28.62  to  9.75 mol/kg. It meant that high concentration of  Zhundong coal decreased the amount  of supercritical water molecules around reactants. It can be deduced that the enhancement of heat transfer and effective catalyst were possible solutions to enhance the gasification process.
When the concentration of  Zhundong coal was 5  wt%,76.74%  of the sodium content in  coal was found in  the liquid phase and 23.25% of the sodium was found in the solid phase. The sum of sodium in the liquid and solid phase was not equal to  unity due to  the experimental errors. When the concentration increased from 5 wt% to 15 wt%,  the sodium measured in  the liquid phase decreased and the sodium in  the solid phase increased. It proved that low concentration was in favor of complete gasification and the release of sodium from coal into liquid phase.
Effect of residence time

Fig. 2 showed the influence of residence time on  gasification results. The fraction of CO was still within the range of 1%~3%. It was may be due to the catalytic effect on  the water gas  shift reaction as R-2 caused by sodium in Zhundong coal [49,50]. As the residence time increased from 10  min to  30  min, the fraction of H2 increased from 41.76%  to  45.29%  and hydrogen yield increased from 11.53  to  14.92  mol/kg and it proved that long residence time facilitated H2 production. As the residence time increased, the carbon gasification efficiency increased from 33.89%  to  37.96%,  meanwhile, the sodium content remained in solid phase decreased from 65.89%  to 29.47%.

Effect of temperature

Fig.  3 showed the effects of  reaction temperature upon the gasification results. It can be seen that high temperature was in favor of hydrogen production reaction. As the temperature increased from 650 to 750 o C, the carbon gasification efficiency increased from 19.89% to 31.46%. Because Kruse proposed that supercritical water gasification product distribution indicated two competing reaction pathways: One  pathway consisted of ionic reaction steps preferred at higher pressure and/or lower temperature. The second reaction pathway was a free radical degradation dominating at lower pressure and/or higher temperature [51,52].  Therefore, in  the case of  high temperature, more sodium in  coal were released from coal matrix because the gasification was enhanced. However, high temperature also led to low dielectric constant so as to restrain the release of  sodium from coal particles. To  sum up the above factors, the experimental results appeared that the distribution deviation was not obvious within the temperature range investigated.

Effect of potassium  carbonate

The experimental results above showed that the sodium in Zhundong coal  had  certain  catalytic  effect  upon  the gasification process in supercritical water. The effect of extra potassium carbonate was investigated and the experimental results were seen in  Fig. 4. It can be  seen by  comparison  of Figs. 4(a) and 1(a) that the fraction of gaseous distribution was quite similar. It proved that the amount of sodium in  Zhundong coal might be adequate for the catalyst for homogeneous reactions in  gas  phase. It can be  seen by comparison of Figs.
1(b) and 4(b) that when the concentration of Zhundong coal was 5 wt%,  the carbon gasification efficiency increased from 45.73  to  78.68%,  and the hydrogen yield increased from 28.62 to  48.86  mol/kg. It  proved that the sodium originally inside Zhundong coal was not adequate for  the heterogeneous car- bon gasification reaction, thus extra addition of catalyst was necessary.

Zhundong coal gasification  in supercritical  water fluidized bed

It can be  seen from the gasification result that the catalytic effect of  potassium carbonate was limited and the carbon gasification efficiency was  41.30%  when the concentration was 15 wt%.  The enhancement of heat and mass transfer is necessary for  further enhancement of  gasification reaction. Supercritical water fluidized bed reactor was famous for  the advantages for  preventing the reactor from shut-down by plugging [53]. Supercritical water fluidized bed reactor system was used to investigate the gasification results. It can be seen from Fig.  5(a)  that the gaseous products are mainly H2 and CO2, and the fractions were 49e52% and 32e35% respectively. The CO fraction was within the range of 2e3%. The gaseous product distribution was quite similar to  the experimental results by  the autoclaves. When the concentration of Zhundong coal was 40%,  the carbon gasification efficiency was 95.7%  and the hydrogen yield was 42.22  mol/kg. When the concentration was 30 wt%,  the carbon gasification efficiency was 97.3%  and the hydrogen yield was 48.56   mol/kg. The concentration of  the coal water slurry upon the gasification results of  supercritical water fluidized bed reactor was observed in  Fig. 5. It is emphasized that concentration for autoclaves referred to  the concentration in  the autoclaves. The concentration  for  the supercritical water fluidized bed reactor referred to  the concentration of  the feedstock (coal- water-slurry), and the concentration in  the reactor can be calculated by considering the dilution effect of the preheated water.
The carbon gasification efficiency was obtained in  the re- action temperature range of 620e660 o C. It can be  seen that carbon gasification efficiency of  Zhundong coal in  fluidized bed was obviously much higher than that in  autoclaves, and the reasons might be  as follows: (1)From the point of view of thermodynamics, higher reacting temperature causes higher hydrogen yield [47]. And  the heating rate is the most important factor for  supercritical water gasification of coal particle for a certain reactor temperature. When the heating rate of the coal particle is slow, the time for  the coal particle in  the low temperature  condition would be  long, afterward  unwanted intermediates will  be  produced to  form char, once formed, is difficult to  be  gasified [54e56]. In the autoclave, the temperature has almost the same heating rate with the fluid inside the reactor, while in supercritical water fluidized bed reactor, the temperature of  the coal particle was increased to  the bed temperature  rapidly. (2)The coal gasification reaction in  supercritical water is endothermic, and the water temperature around coal particle may be decreased, which has a negative effect upon the gasification process. While in  supercritical water fluidized bed reactor, the heat transfer around a coal particle is vigorously enhanced by the random motion of the coal particles. (3)In  the process of  the coal gasification, the products and intermediates are needed to be diffused and the reactant supercritical water is needed to  be  diffused towards the coal particles, otherwise, the unwanted polymerization reaction results in the formation of by-products such as char. The diffusion coefficient of organic matter or  gas  is not high enough in  autoclave compared with supercritical water fluidized bed reactor [48,57,58]. So it  is  obviously seen that the carbon gasification efficiency was far  higher than that of autoclaves. Besides, supercritical water has the potential ability to  separate the ash from the reactor, and the bed material is apt to  support catalyst [59]. Therefore, it is  believed that supercritical water fluidized bed reactor is a promising reactor type for  coal gasification in supercritical water.
Sodium distribution was also studied in supercritical water fluidized bed reactor. The sodium distribution was only measured in  the liquid phase since Figs.  1e3(c) showed good sodium balance to  prove the rationality of  the sodium measuring method used in this paper. It can be deduced from the  former experiments that  the  system was believed to operate stably when the accumulated gas   yield was linear with the running time [60]. When the system operation was in stable condition, the liquid effluent from the low-pressure gaseliquid separator  [60]  was collected with a measuring flask. The liquid effluent was diluted by 50-fold and measured by  ICP.  The experimental result showed that  only a small amount of  the sodium was carried away from the fluidized bed reactor and vast majority of  sodium remained in  the fluidize bed reactor due to  the limit solubility of  inorganic salts. In the case of 30 wt%  concentration case, 0.061%  of sodium was released from the  fluidized bed reactor, thus 99.939% of sodium remained in fluidized bed reactor. While in the case of 40 wt% concentration case, 99.932% of sodium was remained in the fluidized bed reactor. The deposited inorganic slats might be deslaged by lock-hopper online and the online deslagging device is  developing and related details will  be published later.
Conclusions

The gasification results  of  Zhundong coal and the sodium distribution characteristics in supercritical water were inves- tigated. The following conclusions were drawn:

1) Low Zhundong coal concentration and long residence time were in favor of the release of sodium from Zhundong coal. Reaction temperature  had  great influence upon carbon gasification efficiency but had no  significant effect upon sodium distribution.
2) Zhundong  coal slurry  with  40  wt%   concentration  was gasified  within   the   reaction   temperature    range   of
620 o Ce660 o C, the carbon gasification efficiency was 95.7%
and the hydrogen yield was 42.22  mol/kg. 99.932%  of  so- dium in Zhundong coal was remained in the fluidized bed reactor and could be removed as inorganic salts.
3) Supercritical water  fluidized bed reactor is  an effective reactor  for    Zhundong  coal  gasification  and   sodium removal.

The  high contents of sodium and calcium in Zhundong coal  induce severe slagging and ash deposition in boilers. In this study, the ash deposition mechanism was investigated based on  the results obtained from a full-scale boiler (350 MW) burning Zhundong coal,  and a ﬁxed bed reactor used for  ash evaporating- condensing. In  the full-scale boiler,  the condensing and depositing of  sodium and calcium sulfates play an  important role on  ash depositing on  convection heating surfaces. Sulfates start to signiﬁcantly condense and deposit at the ﬂue gas  temperature of about 850 ℃ on the medium and high temperature reheater surfaces. Ash  evaporating tests proved that, with the increasing in  temperature from 400 ℃ to 1200 ℃, the ash evaporating process is  divided into three stages: 1)  400e800 ℃, 80% of  sodium,  and100%  of  chlorine are released; 2)  800e1000 ℃, all  the left sodium evaporates and sulfur starts to be released with the formation of partial aluminosilicates; 3)  1000e1200 ℃, all  the left sulfur is released through the decomposition of calcium sulfates and then calcium starts to evaporate, while silicon oxides disappear due to the formation of new complex silicates. Ash  condensing tests further proved that, the sodium in Zhundong coal  was released mainly in the forms of atom, oxide, and chloride, in which sodium chloride account for  about 50%.  When the evaporating temperature  increased higher than 1000 ℃, partial alkali and alkaline earth metals were released as  gaseous sulfates, and afterward condense and deposit on the heating surfaces. At last, a temperature-dependent  ash deposition mechanism in  Zhun- dong coal  combustion was proposed.
1.  Introduction
Zhundong, located in the east of Junggar Basin,  Xinjiang, China, with the forecast reserves of 390  billion tons is the largest intact coalﬁeld in the world. According to the current coal consumption in China, the Zhundong coal could meet the needs for coal consumption in China for the next 100  years [1,2]. Zhundong coal is characterized by high ignition quality and low environmental threat due to the high volatile content  and ultralow ash   and sulfur contents.  However, similar with the brown coal in Australia [3e6], the content of sodium in Zhundong coal ash  is very high, generally more than 5%, far more than the normal sodium content level in typical Chinese coal, usually between 1 and 2% [7,8].  Consequently severe problems of slagging, fouling, and corrosion on boiler heating surfaces are induced, which deteriorate the heat ﬂux, efﬁciency, and lifetime of a boiler [9]. Xi'an Thermal Power Research  Institute  (TPRI) investigated the slagging and fouling status quo  of dozens of boilers burning Zhundong coal in Xinjiang, China.  It indicated that boilers would be under great threat from slagging when the sodium content in coal ash exceeded 2.5 and
3% for 100  MW  and 225e350 MW  boilers, respectively. The  boiler adaptability of even larger capacity 600e1000 MW on high sodium coal is still unknown [7].
In this study eight kinds of Zhundong coal were compared with twenty-seven kinds of non-Zhundong coal very commonly used in China,  including bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal. The inverse values of  sodium, calcium and sulfur content  in  ash  are plotted in Fig. 1, showing that Zhudnong coal  is astricted to a very limited region. It can  also  be observed that the calcium and sulfur contents in Zhundong coal ash  were much higher than the average contents in  non-Zhundong coal  ash.  The  contents of calcium and sulfur in  certain types of Zhundong coal  ash  are  higher than 30%, and in some cases even 40%. Harbin Boiler Company has  conducted a test in a 300 MW boiler co-ﬁring Zhundong coal, and after a dozen days operation, the convection heating surfaces were blocked by severe slagging and ash  deposition. In this test, a high amount of calcium sulfates was found in  the slags  and deposits [10].  These observations indicated that beside sodium, calcium and sulfur species also  play  an  important role  in the slagging and ash  depositing process.
Recently,  only   a  few  studies investigated the Zhundong coal slagging. He et al. [11] used Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) to measure atomic sodium emissions in  Zhundong coal combustion under low  O2  concentration (3.9e10.6%,  oxygen-fuel combustion).  The   study  showed  that  very  little  sodium  was released from the Zhundong coal's volatile matters. 20e38% of sodium was released from the char content while 60e78%  of sodium was released from the ash  content. The  study also  showed that the ratio of  potassium released from the char content was enhanced by  O2  but   inhibited by  CO2  concentration. Zhou  et al. [12,13] developed  an  ash  deposition probe with charge-coupled device camera and heat ﬂux monitoring system to  on-line record the deposition thickness and heat ﬂux in a 300  KW test furnace. It was found that the deposit growth process was composed of four stages and the slagging deposits showed layer structures. However, the enrichment of alkali and alkali-earth metal was not found in each deposition layer.  Xu  et al.  [1]  compared the ash  properties from Zhundong coal co-ﬁring in a lab-scale drop tube furnace and a power plant boiler,  which agreed well.   The  study showed that particles smaller than 10  mm  had higher Ca, Fe, and Mg  content, while the weight fractions of sodium and potassium were not that high. In another study on Zhundong coal slagging, the ash  deposits were collected from different positions in  a  30  MW  subcritical boiler.  The  chemical analysis showed that the ash  fouling on  the superheater tubes was formed with a thinner Fe-rich layer followed by  the deposition of  Na2SO4  liquids.  The  slagging in  the water
cooled wall  was mainly induced by the low-temperature eutectics
from the interaction of CaO and Fe2O3  on the receding char surface, and the eutectic CaeAleSi containing Fe2þ-bearing oxide [9]. The other studies on  Zhundong coal  slagging were mainly focused on the ash  fusion and melting by  using lab-scale furnaces and ash melting  apparatus.  Meng [14]   found that  the low-temperature eutectics of ferrum and aluminosilicate played an  important role in  the high-temperature sintering of  Zhundong coal  ash  and its slagging near the water cooled wall.  It  was also  found that this phenomenon is comparatively affected by O2 concentration. Wang et al. [15]  following the State Standard of GB/T 212-2008 and GB/T
219-1996, measured the ash  melting temperature for  different Zhundong coal  co-ﬁring tests. The  study showed that there was a worst co-ﬁring ratio for the lowest melting temperature. However, the most recent work [16]  pointed out  that the two named stan- dards were not suitable for  the evaluation of Zhundong coal  ash melting, since the  softening temperature  decreased by  100   ℃, when the ashing temperature was lowered from 815  to 500  ℃.
Summarizing the previous results, the authors note that the slagging problem in Zhundong coal  combustion is mainly ascribed to two reasons: (1)  the formation of  low-temperature eutectics containing ferrum at high furnace temperatures in the water cooled wall  region, and (2) re-condensing of evaporated alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) at lowered gas  temperatures in the convection heating surface region. The  melting or  fusion of eutectics containing ferrum has   been widely reported, regardless of  coal types, and it mainly depends upon the primary components in coal ash  like  silicon, aluminum, and calcium. However, the trans- formation of AAEMs is more associated t℃oal types, for Zhundong coal  as newly found low-rank lignite with extremely high sodium and calcium content, the understanding of AAEMs transformation and ash  deposition is still  insufﬁcient. Therefore, this study aims to investigate ash  deposition mechanism in  the convection heating surface region of  boilers burning Zhundong coal, via incorporating the tests in a full-scale boiler and in a lab-scale ﬁxed bed reactor. In the full-scale 350 MW boiler, the slags and deposits were collected and analyzed at different convection heating surfaces along the gas  ﬂow direction. Moreover,  a special temperature-controlled condensing probe, above the fuel stack, was designed to capture the released AAEMs vapor in a ﬁxed bed  reactor. The  residual solid   ash  and the captured condensed species were analyzed by using X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM),  and energy dispersive spec- trometer (EDS). The  research goal  is to build a full  transformation mechanism of sodium and calcium from the Zhundong coal, through evaporating and condensing, to deposits in boilers.

2.  Experimental section

2.1.  Fuel properties

Since  there is no  boiler that could completely be  operated on Zhundong coal,  in  the full-scale test Zhundong (ZD) coal  was co- ﬁred with Zhunnan (ZN) coal,  while in lab-scale test only  ZD coal was used. The  fuel  properties of ZD and ZN coal  are  compared in Table  1. The  water content in  ZD coal  is twice of that in  ZN coal, while the ash  content in ZD coal  is lower than in the ZN coal. Note that the ash  fusion temperatures (DT, ST, and HT) of ZD coal  are
higher than that of ZN coal by 120  ℃, even if the slagging of ZD coal
is much more severe. The  contents of calcium and sodium in  ZD coal  ash  are  over 40% and 6%, respectively. These two contents are much higher in ZD coal  than that in ZN coal,  however the ferrum content in ZD and ZN coal  ash  is almost the same. The comparison of fuel  properties indicates that the key  factors inducing slagging should be  high sodium and calcium contents, rather than melting and ferrum content.

2.2.  Slag and  deposit sampling in a full-scale boiler

Slags  and deposits were sampled in a 350  MW  tangential-ﬁred boiler (Model, DG1211/17.4-II22) after  continuous  operating  for six months. As shown in the Fig. 2, ﬁve layers of burners (a, b, c, d, and e) were running, in which three layers (b, c, and e) were used for ZD coal  combustion and the other two layers (a, d) were for ZN coal. Because the coal feeding quantity in each layer is the same, the co-ﬁring ratio of ZD coal  is about 60%, and the remaining 40% if of ZN coal. The sampling positions are  also  marked in the Fig. 2. They are  located on  each convection heating surface along the gas  ﬂow direction: wall  reheater (A-WR),  separation platen superheater (B- DPS), platen superheater (C-PS), medium and high temperature reheater (D-MHR),  high temperature superheater (E-HS),  low temperature superheater (F-LS), economizer (G-Eco),  air preheater (H-Pre).

2.3.  Evaporating and  condensing of ash  species

The  evaporating and re-condensing test was operated in  the schematic experimental system in Fig. 3, mainly including evaporating unit and condensation sampling unit. The  crucible contain- ing samples was heated in a tube furnace for ash  evaporating. An S- type thermocouple was inserted from furnace bottom to  measure the evaporating temperature. The  temperature-controlled condensation sampling unit was 5 cm  above the crucible, in order to capture the evaporated metal species for 1 h. The sampling unit was cooled by  air  and the sampling substrate at  the bottom was dismountable for  further analysis. A K-type thermocouple was welded on  the substrate inner surface to  measure the condensing  surface temperature,  which  was  controlled  at   500   ± 5  ℃  by adjusting air  speed. This condensing temperature range was used, since in the previous work by Schoﬁeld [17] it was reported that the deposition rate of sodium salts was almost unchanged with probe temperature  changing, when  the  probe  temperature  is  below 550  ℃
The fuel  sample was heated from ambient temperature to three
targeted temperatures: 500, 800, and 1000 ℃ at a constant heating rate of 5 ℃/min. The  entire evaporating process was divided into three stages and the condensed metal vapor species were continuously sampled at each stage by changing a new substrate.
The evaporation and condensation sampling were continuous in this apparatus, thus it  was impossible to  obtain the residual ash sample in  the crucible for  analysis. Therefore, the ash  was again prepared in an  atmosphere-controlled mufﬂe furnace (KSL-1700X, made by Hefei  Ke Jing Materials Technology Co., Ltd., China) by the heating curve shown in Fig. 3, at 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1100, 1150 and 1250 ℃ under air atmosphere. The total ﬂow rate passing through
the furnace and samples was controlled at 500  ml/min (O2, 100  ml/ min; N2, 400  ml/min). In this paper, only  the data at 400e1100 ℃ were presented, because at the high temperature of 1150e1250 ℃,the ash  samples melted and were tightly adhered on  the crucible surfaces, and it was impossible to carry out  the analysis.

2.4.  Characterization of slag  and  deposit samples

X-ray  ﬂuorescence (XRF, S4 PIONEER, Germany) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'pert MPD  Pro,  PANalytical, Netherlands)  were used to  analyze the element distribution and the chemical com- ponents of the deposits from full-scale furnace, and of the residual ash  from the mufﬂe furnace. The  micro-morphology and the element distribution in  the condensed deposits on  sampling sub-strate surfaces were analyzed by  using scanning electron micro- scopyeenergy  dispersive  spectrometry   (SEMeEDS,   JEOL  JSM-6390A,  Japan).

3.  Results  and discussion

3.1.  Morphology and  chemical components of deposit samples in a full-scale boiler

The  ﬂue gas,  steam, air,  and wall  temperature at  each heating surface were  collected from power plant  control system, and plotted in Fig. 4(a).  In this power plant burning Zhundong coal, the wall-temperature was mainly monitored at  the heating surface of super heaters and reheaters. At each stage of heating surfaces, there were  twelve  temperature  monitors, and  the  wall-temperature value in Fig. 4 was obtained after averaging. The water-steam and ﬂue gas  temperatures were obtained by directly reading from the monitor system of the power plant.
The  morphologies of slags  and ash  deposits along gas  ﬂow direction are  shown in Fig. 4(b).  It can  be seen that all the slags  and deposits from A-WR  to E-HS have a dark-red color,  which can  be associated to the presence of the ferrous oxides. In the region of high ﬂue gas temperatures (A-WR and B-DPS, Tﬂue gas > 872 ℃), there are a certain amount of dark porous slags.  In medium gas temperature regions (C-PS, D-MHR, and E-HS, 872  ℃ > Tﬂue  gas>630 ℃), there were no dark porous slags and these compacted deposits looked like blocky red  soil.  At last  three heating surfaces (F-LS, G-Eco, and H- Pre,  630  ℃ > Tﬂue  gas  > 141  ℃), no  blocky deposit was found, and there was mainly the loose ash stacking on horizontal tube surfaces. The samples in Fig. 4 can be divided into three groups: dark porous slags,  compacted dark-red blocks, and loose ash  stackings.
The  elemental  compositions  for   all   the  deposit  samples collected on  each surfaces are   displayed as  stacked columns in Fig. 5(a). It can be seen that the top  three elements in most deposits are  silicon, calcium, and sulfur, corresponding to the co-ﬁring ratio, ash  and inorganic elemental content in raw fuels.  The ash  content in ZN coal is more than twice of that in ZD coal, and silicon content in ZN coal ash  is almost 45% while that in ZD coal is below 18%. The calcium content ranks the ﬁrst (~40%) and third (~13%) in ZD and ZN  coal  ash,   respectively.  The  sulfur contents in  these deposits range from 11% to 24%, much higher than the ash  sulfur contents in Table  1. This indicates that sulfur oxides released from volatile and char react with inorganic ash species, and form sulfates that deposit on  the ash  or heating surfaces. The  sodium content is comparably low  and stable ranging from 3 to 5%.
In Fig. 5(a),  it can  also  be observed that in the region of D-MHR and  E-HS,  the  contents of  calcium and  sulfur were  suddenly enlarged while the contents of silicon and aluminum were lowered.
This  indicates that  calcium and sulfur species have higher concentrations in these two regions. To show it more clearly, the mass ratios of  S/(Si  þ Al), Ca/(Si  þ Al), and Na/(Si  þ Al) are  shown in Fig. 5(b).  In Fig. 5(b),  the signiﬁcant increase of sulfur, calcium, and sodium content in D-MHR and E-HS regions can be observed. These three element contents in E-HS region are  2.5 times than that in A- WR, B-DPS, F-LS, G-Eco, and H-Pre regions.
Comparing the  ﬂue  gas   temperature  in   Fig.  4(a)   with the elemental composition in Fig. 5(b), it can be seen that from A-WR t℃-PS, the ﬂue gas  temperature decreases from 1316 to 872  ℃, and there is no  apparent increase of sodium, calcium, and sulfur con- tent. However, from C-PS to D-MHR, with the ﬂue gas temperature further decreases from 872  to 772  ℃, a sharp increase in sodium, calcium, and sulfur content can be observed. This proves that in the temperature range of 872e772 ℃, amount of gaseous sodium and calcium sulfates condense into sulfate aerosols and then deposit on ash  particle and heating surfaces. The  condensing and depositing quantity of sulfates reaches the highest value at  695  ℃, in  E-HS region. Most sulfates condense and deposit in  D-MHR  and  E-HS region (872e630 ℃), since at the last  three heating surfaces (F-LS, G-Eco,  and H-Pre, 630  ℃ > Tﬂue  gas  > 141  ℃), sulfate content in deposits and ash  is almost constant.
The  observed phenomenon is  very similar with our  previous studies related to  the ash  deposition in  a full-scale grate furnace burning biomass with high potassium content [18].  In biomass furnaces, the gaseous sodium sulfates in  ﬂue gas  also  started its condensing and depositing on  medium  heating  surfaces below
900  ℃ [19].  This indicated that, when combusting fuels  with high
contents of AAEMs, there is a critical temperature around 850  ℃, at which most of the AAEMs sulfates start to condense, form aerosols, and to deposit.
XRD analysis was conducted to qualitatively identify the major and minor mineral components in  slags  and deposits shown in Table  2. In this table the pane color depth stands for mineral con- tent level.  The eight samples were divided into two groups: in the ﬁrst group (AeE) CaSO4 ranked the ﬁrst, while in the second group (FeH) SiO2  ranked the ﬁrst. This  is  corresponding to  the macro morphology and elemental composition results. The  samples in ﬁrst group are  mainly porous slags  and blocky deposits, due to the melting at high temperatures and condensing at medium temperatures. In  the second group, since already most of  sulfates have condensed and deposited in previous regions, CaSO4 content in this group of deposits decreases, SiO2  and Al6Si2O13 contents increase. Therefore these samples look  like  loose ash  containing more aluminosilicates. Moreover, the authors tried to ﬁnd sodium sulfates in the samples, however,  no  Na2SO4 was  found, only   some minor minerals like  NaAlSiO4,  (Na,Ca)(Si,Al)4O8, and  Na2S.  The  named minerals were also  mainly detected in the regions of C-PS, D-MHR,and E-HS, at  medium gas  temperatures. The  possible patterns  of sodium  sulfates might  be   covered  by  that of  calcium sulfates, because the calcium content was 40.69%  that was almost seven times of sodium content 6.07% as shown in Table  1.


3.2.  Chemical component of coal  ash  at  different evaporating temperatures

The  full-scale co-ﬁring test gives  the chemical components of slags   and deposits on  heating surfaces in  boilers, which clearly showed the  enrichment and depositing of  calcium sulfates on heating surfaces. However, due to the co-ﬁring of ZD and ZN coal, and relative lower content of sodium, 1/8  of calcium content, the enrichment of  sodium species in  deposits was not observed. To further demonstrate the evolution of  sodium from the raw Zhungdong coal  to  deposits, the experiments of  ash  evaporating and re-condensing were conducted.
Zhundong coal  ash  was mainly prepared in a mufﬂe furnace at
temperatures ranging from 400 to 1400 ℃ in air atmosphere. At the temperatures  of1200 ℃ and 1400 ℃, the ash   samples melted, ﬂowed, adhered to  the alundum plate, and were impossible to  be analyzed. The SEM micro morphologies of ash prepared at 600, 815,1000,  and 1100 ℃ are shown in  Fig.  6.  With the temperature
increasing from 600  to 1000 ℃, the ash  particles size  decreased with no  conspicuous sintering. However,  when the temperature was continually increased to 1100 ℃, signiﬁcant sintering occurred, ash  particles melted,  and aggregated into large porous pieces. In this study,  the heating time in  mufﬂe furnace is 1 h  at  targeting temperatures, while the practical residence time of coal  and ash particles in boilers is only  3e6 s, which seems incomparable. However,  those ash  particles depositing and adhering on  heating surfaces indeed undergo a much longer period. With the increasing in  deposits thickness on  heating surfaces, the heating transfer ef- ﬁciency is signiﬁcantly reduced, and the wall  or  deposits temperature can  increase from 500  to 1200 ℃ [13].  At such a high local wall  temperature (>1100 ℃), ash  particles on  wall  surfaces melt, aggregated, and tightly adhered on  unclean heating surfaces.
The  elemental composition of ash  at  different temperatures  is shown in Fig. 7(a).  With the increasing in ashing temperature, sodium and potassium contents  decrease, and at  temperature  of 1000℃, there is almost no  alkali metal. In  contrast, for  the elements like  silicon and aluminum, their contents in  ash  increase with temperature increasing. The change of oxygen content is also draws attention. Due  to  its  decreasing with temperature, this phenomenon indicates partial minerals release as oxides. More- over,  what should be  noted is  that sulfur content decreases at 1000 ℃ and becomes zero at 1100 ℃.
Multiplying the elemental content (%) with ashing ratio (%), and raw sample mass (g),  to  reveal the elemental evaporating more clearly, the absolute residual mass of key elements per  gram ZD coal can  be calculated. These values are  plotted in Fig. 7(b).  The right Y axis  scale  of calcium and sulfur is 10  times of that of sodium and chlorine  to  keep  them  in   one    ﬁgure  comparably.   With the increasing in ashing temperature from 400  to 1200 ℃, the evaporating process can  be  divided into three stages identiﬁed by  the curves of ashing ratio and residual element mass. During the ﬁrst stage, from 400 to 815 ℃, 80% of sodium, and 100% of chlorine were released. During the second stage, from 800  to 1000 ℃, all the left sodium evaporated and sulfur started to  be  released. During the third stage, from 1000 to 1100 ℃, all the left sulfur was released and calcium started its evaporating.
The release of chlorine in Zhundong coal  was very similar with our  previous investigation for  biomass fuel,  in  which all  chlorine was also  released at around 800  ℃ [20].  A previous XAFS study showed that all the chlorine in  brown coal  was likely  to  be  associated with sodium [3].  Here it can  be  noted that in  Fig. 7(b)  the released mass quantity of chlorine was much less  than that of so- dium, which indicated that only  partial sodium was released as
chloride and the other might be  released as  atom, oxide, and hydroxide. The calcium in coal  ash  was very stable and released only when the temperature was higher than 1100 ℃. Most of alkaline earth metals (Ca and Mg) existed as ion-exchangeable carboxylates in raw coal,  which decomposed and produced oxides at  low  temperatures   (<900  ℃)   [21].    However,   when  the  temperature increased, partial calcium oxide evaporated, reacting with silicon and aluminum oxides.
XRD patterns were measured to  further illustrate the trans- formation of minerals, and are  shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 shows that in the original ash  at  400  ℃, the major minerals include anhydrite (CaSO4),  quartz (SiO2)  and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) with a very strong signal peak, respectively.  There is  also  a  small amount  of gehlenite  (Ca2Al2SiO7) at this temperature. As the heating temperature increased to  600   ℃, the XRD peak intensity of  CaCO3 greatly decreased, referring to the decomposition of CaCO3:CaCO3 / CaO þ CO2(g) (R1) It was also  found that at 600  ℃, the XRD peak intensity of SiO2decreased but  that of Ca2Al2SiO7  increased, which indicated partial silicon oxides and aluminum oxides might react with calcium ox- ides  to generate gehlenite at a lower temperature through:2CaO þ SiO2  þ Al2O3  / Ca2Al2SiO7 (R2) When  the  heating  temperature  was  increased the  heatingtemperature to  815  ℃, it  was observed that CaCO3  disappeared,SiO2    content  further  decreased,  while  the  peak  intensity  of Ca2Al2SiO7   exceeded that of  SiO2.  This  even more afﬁrmed the possibilities of reactions (R1) and (R2) indicated  above. Besides of the reaction (R2) from CaO t℃a2Al2SiO7, CaSO4 was also  proposed
to react with SiO2 and Al2O3 to produce Ca2Al2SiO7  at around 800 ℃
[22].
When the ash  was prepared at 1100 ℃, the XRD patterns have been totally changed. In the temperature ranging from 400  ℃ to
815  ℃, CaSO4  and SiO2  were always the most abundant mineral species in  ash,   while at  the temperature of  1100 ℃ these two
mineral  species almost  totally  transferred  to   other  phases.  At
1100 ℃ the XRD peak intensity of  Ca2Al2SiO7    increased  again, proving that more gehlenites were formed at higher temperatures by reaction (R2). Moreover, it can  be noted that at the temperature of 1100 ℃ CaMgSi2O7 and CaSiO3 were formed, indicating that with the decomposing of CaSO4, CaO reacted with SiO2  to form wollastonite (CaSiO3).  Akermanites  (CaMgSi2O7) and  augites  (Ca(Mg,Fe) Si2O6) were also found with the participation of magnesium oxides and ferrum oxides. Our  previous results have proved that SiO2  is
highly efﬁcient to  promote the decomposition of  CaSO4.  Consequently, the evolution mechanism of Zhundong coal  ash  with high calcium and sulfur content at higher temperature than 1000 ℃ can be concluded as following:CaSO4  / 

3.3.  Micro-morphology and  elemental component of Re-condensing deposits after  evaporating

In the previous section, the residual ash  properties at  different evaporating temperatures have been declared clearly. However, the evolution of sodium was still not clearly demonstrated by XRD, due to its lower content, compared to other major mineral elements in ash.  In this study, a moderate quench method was used to  obtain
re-condensed sodium species at  the wall  temperature of 500  ℃.
Since  the distance from the evaporating unit to the quench probe bottom is short, the condensed and deposited species on the probe bottom are  capable to  represent the forms of  released inorganic elements from ZD coal  combustion.
The  micro-morphology of  re-condensed species from ZD coal combustion at  500  and 815  ℃ is shown in Fig. 9 (left).  When coal was burned at 500  ℃, there was no  remarkable crystal deposition on  the probe bottom, while at  815  ℃, cubic shaped crystal parti- cles  were observed.  The  element content of  deposits on  probe bottom was analyzed by using EDS for more than ten target points. It was found that there were mainly sodium and chlorine in  the deposits, besides of  the basic  elements of ferrum and chromium for  all  the tested points. The  atom mole contents of sodium and chlorine  in   crystals were  collected and  are   plotted  in   Fig.  9 (right). Fig. 9 (right) shows that most of points deviate from the line  of Na:Cl ¼ 1:1,  but  are  adjacent to  the line  of Na:Cl ¼ 2:1,  or are  in the area of Na:Cl > 2:1.  This indicated that only  50% or less of sodium was released in the form of NaCl, and the other sodium
might be  released in  the form of atoms. van  Eyk et al. [5]  investigated sodium release from Loy Yang  brown coal  by  using quantitative planar laser-induced ﬂuorescence measurement and equilibrium calculation. The study showed that besides of sodium chlorides, the  most likely   sodium compound in  ash   is  sodium oxide. This leaded to the release of atomic sodium from ash  at high temperatures. However, sodium was hardly to be released into the ﬂue gas  in  the form of Na2O  or NaOH,  because even if NaOH  was produced by  Na2O  and H2O  at high temperatures, it  would also equilibrate to produce atomic Na  [23].   The  results of  chemical equilibrium calculation for  sodium compounds by Takuwa and Naruse [24]  also  indicated that there was no  gaseous NaOH at  the temperature below 1100 ℃. However, another work on particulate matter emission from brown coal  combustion found NaCl mainly contributed to  the emission of particles with aerodynamic diameter less  than 0.1  mm  [25].  Li [3]  reviewed the existing forms of sodium in  Victorian brown  coal   with  high content of  AAEMs, which is very similar to Zhundong coal. In this brown coal, sodium species can  mainly be  found in  two forms: as  ion-exchangeable cations  associated  with  the  carboxyl  groups  forming  part  of organic coal  substance or as NaCl associated with the moisture in coal  [3,4,26]. Consequently, in this study, the cubic crystal of NaCl on  probe surfaces should be  from the NaCl  combined with the
moisture in Zhundong coal,  and the other atom sodium should be from the sodium associated with the carboyl groups in Zhundong coal.
After  the ash  was heated to  815  ℃, the third clean deposition probe, also  cooled and with the surface temperature of  500  ℃, was  inserted, and  the  heating temperature  was  increased to 1000 ℃ and kept constant for 1 h. The global micro structures and element contents in deposits are  shown in Fig. 10(a). It can  be seen that there was no  chlorine in the deposits, agreeing well with the results in Fig. 9(b),  since all the chlorine has  been released before the temperature of 815  ℃. As shown in  Fig. 10(a), sulfate species were  observed in   the  deposits at   evaporating  temperature   of1000  ℃.  Also   in   this  ﬁgure  a   small  amount  of   silicon and aluminum can  be  observed, indicating the depositing of  aluminosilicates. Furthermore, a selected measurement on  the element distribution of different kinds of deposits is shown in Fig. 10(b). At evaporating temperature  of  1000 ℃, the deposits on  the probe were mainly divided into two types: (1)  the sulfates of alkali and alkaline earth metals (SAAEMs) containing sulfur, sodium, potassium, and  calcium; (2)   the  aluminosilicates containing  silicon, aluminum,   sodium,   potassium,   calcium,  and   magnesium.   As shown in  Fig. 10(b), the ﬁrst type was gray  and noted as 026  and 028,  while the second type was light white and noted as 025  and 027.  Most of the light white particles were embedded into the gray layer at the bottom. This proved that in the ash  depositing process of  Zhundong coal   combustion, the  released or  formed gaseous sodium chlorides, sodium sulfates, calcium sulfates, and potassium sulfates  ﬁrstly  deposited  on   the  cooling surfaces, and  then partial aluminosilicates were captured and embedded into the ﬁrst layers.
3.4.  Temperature-dependent ash  deposition mechanism in
Zhundong coal  combustion

Based  on the results from the full-scale industry boiler and lab- scale  experiments, a temperature-dependent ash  deposition mechanism cor  the combustion of Zhundong coal,  with high sodium and calcium content,  in  pulverized coal  furnaces was pro- posed in Fig. 11. At a lower temperature of 800  ℃, more than 80% of the sodium in Zhundong coal was released into ﬂue gas in the form of atom sodium, sodium oxides, hydroxide, and chlorides; SO2 was mainly from the oxidation of organic sulfur and pyrites. With the temperature  increased to  1100 ℃, the  left sodium was mainly released in  non-chloride form, while all the left  sulfur in  calcium sulfates was released by the decomposition of calcium sulfates with the formation of  calcium oxides. Starting  from 1000 ℃, partial calcium has  been released as gaseous forms of calcium oxides and atom calcium. As the temperature increased, as high as the ﬂame temperature in pulverized coal furnace, all the sodium and most of the calcium should be  released as  gaseous species, which quickly reacted with sulfur oxides in the ﬂue gas, forming a large amount of gaseous calcium and sodium sulfates [27,28].  At  the temperature ranging from 1100 to 1450 ℃, Zhundong coal  ash  melts and was easy to be adhered on  cooling surfaces.
After the ﬂue gas passes through the convection heating surface, its  temperature is reduced. With the decreasing in  ﬂue gas  temperature, the aerosols of calcium and sodium sulfates started forming. When the  ﬂue  gas   temperature  decreased to   around
850  ℃, a large number of sulfate aerosols are  formed, which very
easily deposit on heating surfaces. These aerosols could also deposit on the surfaces of ﬂy ash,  aggravating the adhering of ash  particles on  heating surfaces. In the meantime, the gaseous sulfates around the cooling surfaces directly condense and deposit on the surfaces. The   depositing  of  sulfate aerosols and  condensed  sulfates on heating surfaces is especially important, since after the formation of such a layer, more and more ﬂy ash  particles were adhered and the depositing layer would grow up  quickly.

4.  Conclusions

In this work, the Ca/Na/S/Cl transformation and ash  deposition mechanism in  boilers burning Zhundong coal  with high calcium and sodium contents were investigated. The main conclusions are as following:
(1)  In  a full-scale boiler,  the condensing and depositing of sodium and calcium sulfates play  an  important role   on  the slagging and ash  depositing on  convection heating surfaces. Sulfates start to signiﬁcantly condense and deposit at the ﬂue gas  temperature of about 850  ℃ (at  medium and high temperature reheater).
(2)  With the increasing in temperature from 400  to 1200 ℃, the
ash  evaporating process is divided into three stages: a) from
400   to 800   ℃, 80%  of  sodium, and 100%  of  chlorine are released; b) from 800  to 1000 ℃, all the left  sodium evapo- rated and sulfur starts to  be  released with the formation of partial aluminosilicates; c) from 1000 to 1200 ℃, all the left sulfur is  released through  the  decomposition of  calcium sulfates and then calcium starts to  evaporate,  while silicon oxides disappears due to the  formation of  new complex silicates.
(3)  The  condensing quenching test further proved the detailed forms of  released sodium and calcium. The  sodium in Zhundong coal  was released mainly in  the forms of  atom, oxide, hydroxide, and chloride, in which sodium chloride accounts for less  than 50%. When the evaporating temperature increased higher than 1000 ℃, partial alkali and alkaline earth metals were released as  gaseous sulfates, and after- ward condense and deposit on  the heating surfaces.

The paper presents an investigation of flow and noise produced by the generic fan of an environmental control system installed in a circular duct, with a focus on the evaluation of the effect of mean flow distortions and elevated turbulence levels upstream of the fan, which are here created by replacing a baseline smooth bell-mouth duct inlet by inlets with a rectangular-to-circular transition of the duct cross section and with a T junction formed by two circular pipes. The study includes both experiments, which are aimed primarily at supplying data for a validation of simulation approaches and numerical simulations based on a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation approach. An acoustic modal decomposition of the measured and computed unsteady pressure fields is then carried out, which allows extracting “pure” (with filtered out hydrodynamic/turbulent fluctuations) acoustic modes propagating upstream and downstream under reflection-free conditions. A comparison with the experiment is performed for both the “raw” pressure spectra on the duct walls and the extracted individual acoustic modes. It is shown that, in terms of acoustics, a replacement of the clean inlet by the rectangular/circular one is almost neutral, whereas the T-junction inlet causes a strong noise penalty.
Noise produced by the environmental control system (ECS) constitutes a significant part of the overall noise inside an airplane cabin, and so it has a substantial impact on the passengers and crew comfort. Reliable prediction of this noise and revealing its main sources and mechanisms are essential for designing better noise-mitigating ECSs. Of significant interest in this respect are various installation and interaction effects: particularly, the effect of elevated level of turbulent fluctuations caused by nonuniformities of the flow in the ECS ducts on the noise generated by a blower (fan) ingesting such flow distortions. This effect is investigated exactly in the present study, which was carried out in the framework of the European-Union-funded project titled “Integrated Design of Optimal Ventilation Systems for Low Cabin and Ramp Noise” (or IDEALVENT).
The alteration of the noise produced by a rotating machine when it is subjected to different time-averaged and fluctuating inflow properties is well known. Helicopter noise research groups in the 1970s already considered the ingestion of atmospheric turbulence by the rotor and the resulting acoustic emissions [1]. The essential inflow distortion mechanism here, which is also encountered for aeroengines tested on static stands, is the intense longitudinal stretching of the turbulent structures sucked into the rotor that is induced by the contraction of the streamlines [2]. In many other applications reported in the literature, the inflow distortion is induced by local installation effects, e.g., in the presence of a hull with control surfaces for an underwater propulsor [3] or upstream obstructions in ducted axial subsonic fans [4–7]. In those cases, the time-averaged radial and azimuthal nonuniformity of the inflow is a key element affecting tonal noise generation. In [5], obstructions of different sizes and shapes were placed in front of the inlet of a ducted fan in an anechoic chamber. The fan was placed at the duct entrance, permitting free-field acoustic measurements. Conceptually similar free-field investigations were presented in [6] using cylindrical rod obstructions and in [8] for a free propeller placed in the core of a jet stream passing through a modal distortion generator.
A distinctive feature of the present work, with respect to the aforementioned investigations, is the inclusion of the duct response as part of the installation effect by means of in-duct microphone measurements. The coupling between the Fourier–Bessel modal decomposition of the source excitation and the duct response was studied in [9], which established the so-called Tyler and Sofrin rule for noise control, exploiting the duct cutoff properties through suitably chosen blade/vane counts. This is, however, hardly applicable in the case of a generally uncontrolled inflow distortion, which may contain complex and/or unknown Fourier–Bessel modal content and thereby defeat a strategy aimed at decoupling the source from the duct response [5]. Yet, the modal decomposition of the in-duct microphone measurements remains quite useful to extract the component of the pressure field corresponding to acoustic waves propagating away from the source, from the fluctuations associated with the boundary layer turbulence, or from acoustic reflections at the duct terminations [10,11]. The last point is actually essential to perform an unambiguous analysis of installation effects caused by different duct inlet geometries as described in the following because different inlets are associated to different inflow qualities and different acoustic reflection properties simultaneously.
A specific fan considered in the study is a generic ECS blower installed in a circular duct and having a rotor with 15 blades and a stator with 10 vanes (see Fig. 1). The duct inner diameter D is equal to 0.15 m; the rotation speed is around 11,200 rpm; and the bulk flow velocity is approximately 32 m∕s, resulting in a Reynolds number of the flow close to that in practical applications. To analyze the effect of the flow distortions upstream of the fan, three different cases are considered. In the first (baseline) case, the duct has a smooth bell-mouth inlet, resulting in a “clean” flow upstream of the fan with turbulence confined within a thin boundary layer on the duct wall. Note that, even using a well-designed inlet bell mouth, it is rather difficult to completely eliminate residual large-scale motions in the room where the inlet is located, which by acceleration and turbulence stretching can still induce significant tonal noise [12,13]. In the other two cases, a significant nonuniformity of the flow and elevated levels of turbulent fluctuations in the upstream part of the duct away from its walls are created by replacing the bell-mouth inlet by inlets with a rectangular-to-circular transition of the duct cross section and with a T junction formed by two circular inlet pipes (see Fig. 2). In this work, it is assumed that a reasonably designed ECS will guarantee that the blower will operate around its maximum efficiency point, even for complex geometrical layouts. For this reason, some care is applied to not significantly change the operating point of the fan, unlike in other studies, as described in [4], where some distortions induced sufficient blockage to lead to nearly choked conditions.
The study includes both a set of experiments aimed primarily at supplying data for validation of different simulation approaches and numerical investigations based on a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)/large-eddy simulation (LES) approach. This approach offers a computationally affordable scale-resolving simulation strategy with a low level of empiricism potentially capable of an accurate prediction of both tonal and broadband components of the noise generated by ducted fans at practical (rather high) Reynolds numbers. An alternative numerical technique, having received an increasing interest over the past decade, is based on the lattice- Boltzmann approach, and it was recently applied to fairly complex installed configurations such as a low-speed axial fan [14], an automotive cooling module [15], or a centrifugal ventilation system [16], albeit at considerably smaller Reynolds and tip Mach numbers than in the present study.
Amajor goal of this work is to check whether the developed numerical system really possesses the capability to simulate geometrically complex systems, with particularly small rotor–stator axial separation, as can be seen in Fig. 1, including capturing the relatively subtle effect of the fan noise alteration caused by the inlet distortions.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II contains an overview of experiments carried out at the von Kármán Institute for Fluid Dynamics. Then, Sec. III presents a description of the developed simulation approach, the numerical system employed in the calculations, and the computational setup. Section IV discusses results of the simulations and their comparison with available experimental data. Finally, some conclusions are formulated in Sec. V.
Considering that the present paper is mainly concerned with the simulation aspects of the ducted-fan flows, the characterization of the experimental part of the study will only be a brief overview.
The experimental rig for the various ducted-fan test cases is installed in the anechoic room of the von Kármán Institute for Fluid Dynamics. The duct is composed of modules corresponding to a fan or/and various flow obstructions and instrumented sections (static pressure probes, a radial and azimuthal hot-wire traversing system, microphone multiports, and loudspeaker arrays; see Figs. 2 and 3). The modules are made of acrylic glass. As described in the Introduction (Sec. I), to create flow distortions upstream of the fan, the bell-mouth inlet module shown in Fig. 3 is replaced by inlet modules with a rectangular-to-circular transition and a T junction, presented in Fig. 4. Both inlet geometries result in azimuthal inhomogeneity of the mean flow and the turbulence intensity being ingested by the fan, causing an extraneous tonal and broadband noise generation.
The aerodynamic measurements carried out for the three considered ducted-fan flows include the pressure rise across the fan module using two sets of four cross-connected pressure taps, and hot-wire measurements of the maps of the mean streamwise velocity and its root-mean-square fluctuations in several duct cross sections upstream of the fan. The in-duct pressure fluctuations are measured with two flush-mounted microphone arrays: one upstream and one downstream of the fan module.
For the hot-wire measurements, a single probe was used with a motorized radial–azimuthal probe traversing system designed to map the fan inflow over the entire cross section of the duct and quantify the effect of the different inflow modules. A map of the scanning grid is shown in Fig. 5, illustrating that the measurements were concentrated close to the duct wall, down to a minimum wall distance of about 0.002 m, with a total of 385 measurement locations over a crossplane. At the smaller distances to the wall, the velocity needed there for computing the mass flow rate was obtained by interpolation, assuming zero value at the duct wall. The hot-wire anemometer signal was low-pass filtered at 22,500 kHz and acquired at a frequency of 65,536 Hz. At each point of the map, data were acquired for a duration of 15 s, generating around one million time samples, which are considered largely sufficient to obtain mean flow and turbulence intensity with uncertainties well below the intrinsic measurement accuracy.
The simulated operating points of the fan with the three different inlets are superimposed with the experimental performance curve in Fig. 6, demonstrating a good agreement. Furthermore, the figure shows that the fan is operating in a realistic and stable regime, far enough from stall. Also important, it is verified from the simulations that the operating point is not significantly affected by the upstream distortions. This permits relating the extraneous noise generation to the inflow quality, and not to an increase of the steady load exerted on the blades.
Due to the fact that the microphone arrays and loudspeaker modules must be located between the blower unit and the inflow module in order to extract the modal content of the acoustic source, the minimum distance between the blower inlet and the inlet module has to be larger than four duct diameters. As a result, the degree of mean flow inhomogeneity that is ingested by the fan is noticeably attenuated with respect to what the same inlet geometry would generate for a shorter duct. This is illustrated by Fig. 7 which shows cross planes just downstream of the inlet geometry (top row) and just upstream of the fan inlet, approximately four duct diameters downstream of the duct inlet (bottom row) for bell-mouth inlet (first column), rectangular-to-circular inlet (middle column), and T-junction inlet (last column).
Regarding the in-duct acoustic measurements themselves, an elaborated system involving multiple-microphone and multiple- loudspeaker arrays was developed with the aim of extracting the noise produced by the fan, irrespective of the changing acoustic reflecting conditions induced by the different inlet geometries, as the objective of this study is indeed to investigate the inlet aerodynamic installation effect, and not the acoustic one. The approach was based on a modal decomposition of the acoustic field measured at a number of wall-mounted microphone locations, as well as on the prior measurement of the modal reflection matrices of the duct terminations and of the modal scattering matrix of the fan itself. This permitted extraction of the noise that would be radiated by the fan placed in an anechoic duct (the so-called active or source component of the acoustic field), and it compared the measured and simulated fan noise without ambiguity (in the present work, this is done only for the case of the bell-mouth inlet; see Sec. IV.C). More details about the modal extraction, which was based on an extension of a general linear multiport approach [10–11], were provided in [17–20].
In general, the approach developed for the solution of the considered problem consisted of direct computation of the noise produced by the fan based on a compressible scale-resolving simulation of turbulence with the use of a hybrid RANS-LES method of the detached-eddy simulation type, namely, the improved delayed detached-eddy simulation (IDDES;[21]). This method is currently well established for unsteady simulations in both aerodynamic and aeroacoustic applications, including engine and airframe noise (see, e.g., [22–30]).
In the presence of “inflow” turbulent content, IDDES performs as a wall-modeled LES (WMLES). To “inject” such turbulent content, specially designed distributed volumetric source terms are introduced into the momentum and turbulent kinetic energy transport equations within a confined region located upstream of the fan. This approach, called the volume synthetic turbulence generator (VSTG) is based on the earlier proposed efficient “surface” synthetic turbulence generator (STG) [25]. Its formulation and some results of validation can be found in [31]. Thus, within the developed computational procedure, the IDDES is used as a zonal method that functions in the RANS mode upstream of the VSTG area and in the WMLES mode downstream of this area. Similar to the STG [25], the VSTG parameters are set based on the RANS solution in the corresponding duct section and ensure that the “created” turbulence matches the RANS Reynolds stresses right downstream of the VSTG region. A major advantage of the VSTG over the STG [25] and other surface generators of synthetic turbulence is that, with a sufficiently stretched source region, it does not create any noticeable spurious noise, which is of primary importance for aeroacoustic problems.
Note that the IDDES version used in the present study employs the shear-stress transport with curvature correction (SST-CC) model of Smirnov and Menter [32] as a background RANS turbulence model. This model presents an adaptation of the curvature–rotation correction suggested in [33,34] for the one-equation Spalart–Allmaras model [35] to the two-equation k-ω SST model [36]. This model was chosen because unlike the model [33] it provides a modeled turbulent kinetic energy which is an input parameter of the VSTG technique.
In principle, the outlined approach is capable of predicting both the tonal and the broadband components of the noise produced by the fan and its propagation over the ventilation duct and into the surrounding ambient air. However, such computations would require nonaffordably large computational resources. For this reason, in the present work, the subdomain in which the turbulence-resolving (IDDES) computations are performed is limited to a relatively small part of the duct neighboring the fan module.
As a result, the whole computational procedure, in addition to the main (“production”) IDDES computation in such a truncated domain, involves two auxiliary precursor stages necessary for setting inflow and outflow boundary conditions for the production simulation. Specifically, the inflow profiles used in the IDDES stage of the computations are obtained from the steady RANS computation of the duct inlet flow. The information needed for imposing the outflow boundary conditions is obtained from a precursor unsteady RANS (URANS) computation of the fan flow (a more detailed description of the boundary conditions is presented in the next section).
Another consequence of carrying out scale-resolving simulations in the limited computational domain is that the extraction of the acoustic signal from such simulations is far from trivial. Indeed, in the vicinity of the noise-generating region (at least downstream of it), the acoustic signal is strongly covered with pressure fluctuations caused by turbulence and, in particular, by impingement of turbulent structures on the duct walls. Furthermore, despite employing “nonreflecting” boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of the IDDES computational domain, some inlet and outlet reflections of the sound waves are still possible. So, in order to extract acoustic signals that are free of reflections and hydrodynamic fluctuations, specialized supplementary acoustic techniques should be used. In the present work, for this purpose, a methodology for acoustic mode extraction based on a linear multiport model [10,11,17–20] is adapted.
As mentioned, the extraction of the acoustic signal from the experimental data faces similar difficulties because the in-duct microphones also cannot distinguish between the acoustic and hydrodynamic/turbulent fluctuations of the wall pressure. In addition, as will be shown in the following, in the experiment the in-duct acoustic field is contaminated by reflections of sound waves by the duct terminations much more significantly than in the simulations. Therefore, postprocessing of both the measured and the computed pressure fluctuations with the use of the modal decomposition technique [10,11,17–20] is needed to ensure a consistent comparison of the predicted acoustic characteristics with the experiment.
The locations of the inflow and outflow boundaries of the computational domains and boundary conditions used in the three stages of the fan flow computations outlined previously are presented in Fig. 8.
A precursor steady RANS is performed in the computational domains, which include the inlet modules and an adjacent part of the ventilation duct of the length of 5D. At the RANS inflow boundary, the total pressure and the temperature are prescribed. At the outflow, the static pressure is assumed to be a constant adjusted in the course of the computations to match the experimental mass flow rate (MFR) through the duct equal to 0.636 kg∕s for all three considered cases (this corresponds to the bulk flow velocity around 32 m∕s). The computational domains used in the precursor URANS stage and in the main (production) IDDES stage are identical and include the fan module and the upstream and downstream parts of the duct of the lengths of 3D and 6D, respectively. The inflow/outflow boundary conditions used in these stages are as follows.
The inflow profiles are prescribed based on the known solution of the precursor steady RANS in the corresponding duct section. To prevent reflections of the sound waves from the URANS/IDDES inlet, the imposed boundary conditions are of a characteristic type. Namely, they prescribe the profiles of the incoming one-dimensional (1-D) Riemann invariants, whereas the outgoing invariant at the boundary is computed by extrapolation from the interior of the computational domain.
At the outflow boundary, in the precursor URANS stage, the value of the static pressure pout is tuned to ensure the given MFR. All the other flow quantities at this boundary are obtained by extrapolation from the interior of the domain. Then, in the final IDDES stage of the computations, a mitigation of reflections from the outflow boundary of the domain is ensured by using a “sponge” (“absorbing”) layer technique [37]. The width of the outflow sponge layer shown in Fig. 8 is around 3D,and a “target” solution within this layer is defined as the time average of a precursor URANS solution. The animations of unsteady pressure fields from the simulations suggest that these inflow/outflow boundary conditions prevent any noticeable reflections of sound waves from the boundaries. Yet, postprocessing of the results with the use of the modal decomposition technique [17–20] (see Sec. IV.C) reveals that, in fact, at few frequencies, these reflections are far from negligible.
Note, finally, that both the URANS and the IDDES computations are performed in the full azimuthal domain (360 deg) with the use of a rotating “rotor” grid block and sliding interfaces between the rotating and stationary grid blocks (see the following). Therefore, they do not rely on any assumption of the azimuthal periodicity of the flow, which is widely used in the fan flow modeling but is not justified in the considered cases of the “distorted” duct inlets.
To facilitate the generation of the grid for the IDDES and reduce its size, the real geometry of the fan shown in Fig. 1 was simplified based on a set of preliminary RANS computations carried out in the framework of the IDEALVENT project by A. Wohlbrandt of DLR, German Aerospace Center.§§ The simplifications are as follows:
1）Some geometrical details (such as screws, supply lines, etc.) were ignored. 
2）Cavities present at the front and back of the fan hub were replaced by solid walls. 
3）Small “steps” on the fan casing wall were smoothed.
4）The rotor tip clearance ( 1% of the rotor blades span) and fillets on both the rotor and the stator blades were ignored.
According to RANS, these simplifications do not significantly change the aerodynamic characteristics of the considered flow and, in particular, the pressure rise over the fan module; although, as will be discussed in Sec. IV, their effect on the acoustic characteristics may be substantial. Furthermore, the computational setup did not include a rectangular cavity on the casing wall downstream of the fan (see the far- right frame in Fig. 1). In principle, this cavity may cause acoustic scattering, resulting in a redistribution of the modal content of the acoustic waves. A quantitative evaluation of this effect, as well as of the effect of ignoring the tip clearance on the acoustics, is planned for future work.
The fan flow computations were carried out with the use of a general purpose in-house NTS code [38] capable of the simulation of turbulence in the framework of a full range of turbulence-resolving approaches. This was a structured finite volume high-order computational fluid dynamics code accepting multiblock overlapping grids of the Chimera type. The code has been intensively used for a wide range of aerodynamic and aeroacoustic problems, and it was shown to be reliable and accurate. It was adapted to the computation of the flows with rotating elements with the use of the approach based on employing different reference frames in different grid blocks combined with the sliding interfaces technique for imposing the boundary conditions at the interfaces between rotating and stationary grid blocks (see [39] for more details). A compressible branch of the code used in the present study was based on an implicit Roe-type flux-difference-splitting numerical scheme. In the URANS computations, the inviscid fluxes were approximated with fifth-order upwind-biased differences, except for the rotating grid blocks adjacent to the rotor blades (see below), where switching to the third-order upwind-biased differences turned out to be necessary in order to ensure stability of the simulations in the presence of very large gradients of velocity near the stationary casing wall. In the IDDES computations, in the major part of the computational domain, the approximation of inviscid fluxes was performed with the use of the low-dissipation weighted fourth-order centered/fifth-order upwind-biased scheme, with a fixed weight of the upwind differences equal to 0.1. The exceptions were, again, the grid blocks adjacent to the rotor blades, as well as the VSTG region. Within the former, as in the URANS, the third-order upwind-biased scheme was used. Within the latter, the weight of the upwind differences was set zero in order to ensure a rapid development of resolved turbulent structures.
The viscous fluxes in all the simulations were approximated with the use of a second-order centered scheme.
Finally, the time integration was based on the dual time stepping (with subiterations in pseudotime) and the backward second- order approximation of the time derivatives (three-layer scheme). The simulations were carried out with fixed number of subiterations per time step; Niter 10. This ensured a decrease of the maximum residuals of the governing equations by at least two orders of magnitude.
The grid used in the URANS and IDDES stages of the computations consisted of 34 overlapping blocks. Its structure and topology are illustrated by Figs. 9 and 10, in which the parts of the grid that belong to the rotating blocks treated in the noninertial (rotating) reference frame are shown in red.
The grid upstream and downstream of the hub is axisymmetric, with a Cartesian grid block inserted near the axis of the duct in order to avoid numerical difficulties caused by singularity near the axis arising in computations of three-dimensional (3-D) flows in the cylindrical coordinates. These axisymmetric blocks have Nϕ 124 uniform cells in the azimuthal direction and Nr 90 cells in the radial direction with clustering near the duct wall. The azimuthal grid in the axisymmetric grid blocks over the rotor and stator of the fan is refined by a factor of 3 relative the duct grid and has Nϕ 360 cells, with “intermediate” neighboring blocks with Nϕ 240 (shown in blue in Fig. 9) inserted in order to avoid too-strong abrupt changes of the azimuthal resolution between the rotor/stator and the duct grids. Around the rotor and stator blades, O-type grid blocks are built, which have, respectively, 100 and 150 cells in the circumferential direction (i.e., along the surface of the blades), with grid clustering in the vicinity of the leading and trailing edges of the blades. The radial grid in the passage between the fan hub and casing has Nr 60 cells and is clustered toward both walls. A total number of cells in the streamwise direction Nx is around 750, resulting in about 20 million cells total.
The streamwise grid is refined in the region starting from 2D (0.3 m) upstream and ending by 2.5D (0.38 m) downstream of the fan module, with additional clustering near the forward and rear edges of the hub and in the fan passage. The maximum grid step in this area is Δx m, and then is gradually increased, reaching the value of Δx m. With the high-order numerical scheme, this guaranties an accurate resolution of sound waves propagating along the duct up to a frequency of 6000 Hz (at this frequency, around 10 grid cells are used per the wavelength of the upstream propagating waves).
Finally, the time step was set as Δt s, which resulted in Courant–Friedrich–Lewy values based on the sound velocity of around 1.0 in the fine-grid part of the computational domain. This value of Δt was equal to around 1∕70th of the period corresponding to the rotor blade passing frequency (BPF) of fBPF ≈ 2800 Hz, thus ensuring a sufficiently accurate representation of the flow unsteadiness caused by rotation.
A time sample in the production IDDESs that were started from the flowfields obtained in the precursor URANS was around 35 convective time units; D∕U0. It included a transient period of ≈20 convective units to reach a statistically mature state of the flow and a period of ≈15 convective time units (≈14 full rotor revolutions) used for accumulation of turbulence statistics and instantaneous wall pressure for the computation of the pressure spectra.
Sample visualizations from the IDDES of this flow are presented in Fig. 11 in the form of instantaneous fields of vorticity magnitude and streamwise velocity in the meridian plane of the duct combined with the fields on axisymmetric grid surfaces inside the passage between the hub and the fan casing. In this figure, results are shown for three such surfaces, with the radius in the cylindrical part of the passage rsurf = 0.06 m (close to the hub; first row), rsurf = 0.07 m (middle of the passage; second row), and rsurf = 0.08 m (close to the casing wall; third row). Other than that, Figs. 12 and 13 present a 3-D view of the instantaneous vorticity and two 3-D views of the instantaneous isosurfaces of the swirl (magnitude of the second eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor) “colored” by the value of the streamwise velocity. In addition, in order to give an idea about the difference in the flow representation in the framework of scale- resolving simulations and RANS, Figs. 14 and 15 show sample comparisons of instantaneous fields obtained in the IDDES and in the URANS.
These figures provide a visual representation of turbulence resolved in the simulations. In particular, they show a drastic difference of the scale of the vortical structures present in the IDDES and URANS solutions. Naturally, the URANS is capable of resolving only the large-scale vortices originating from the turbulent wakes of the rotor blades and stator vanes (even these large-scale vortices in the URANS solution rapidly dissipate behind the hub base because of the very large turbulent viscosity predicted by the SST-CC turbulence model in this region; see Fig. 14). The IDDES reveals much “richer” vortical activity. The small-scale vortices in the IDDES are formed in the intervane stator area due to disintegration of the rotor blade wakes, in the stator vane wakes, and in the separation regions behind the hub base and on the suction side of the stator vanes (a shape of the latter separation region is shown in Fig. 16, which presents the time- averaged surface streamlines: “oil flow” visualization). As far as the quality of turbulence resolution reached in the LES regions of the IDDES is concerned, it can be assessed based on Fig. 17 presenting the fields of resolved and time-averaged modeled turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) from the simulations. As seen in the figure, the resolved energy amounts to 80–90% of the total TKE, which shows the quite acceptable accuracy of the simulation with the grid and numerics used.
Note that the flow over the rotor blades remains attached, except for a thin separation near the hub surface, which is probably induced by the separation (also thin) from the forward edge of the hub (the latter may well be caused by the simplification of the hub geometry in the computational model). As a result, despite the presence of the resolved turbulent content in the incoming duct wall boundary layer, with the current grid, the boundary layers forming on the rotor blades are treated effectively in the RANS mode of the IDDES. This does not allow capturing the noise originating from interaction of the fine-scale vortical structures populating these boundary layers with the leading edge of the stator blades, which could be achieved only on the basis of full LES with transition prediction. However, considering that the boundary layer on the rotor blades is very thin, this would require unaffordable computational grids. Nonetheless, despite this evident limitation of the current simulations, quite an acceptable agreement of the broadband component of the predicted and measured wall-pressure spectra in a wide range of frequencies is achieved (see Sec. IV.B). This provides indirect evidence that the simulations do capture a major part of turbulence activity within the noise-generating area. This is partly explained by some peculiarities of the considered typical ECS fan: particularly, the very small rotor/stator separation distance and the presence of multiple separation regions. An application of the approach used in the present study to other designs, for example, to a fan stage of modern turbofan engines [40] might be not that successful, at least on grids of similar density. Figure 18 illustrates a structure of the time-averaged field of the streamwise velocity predicted by the IDDES (the same three axisymmetric surfaces as in Fig. 11 are shown). It reveals the separation region near the suction side of the stator vanes, for which the length decreases while moving along the vane from the fan hub to its casing. This is consistent with the stator oil flow visualization presented in Fig. 16.
Finally, Fig. 19a gives an idea about the unsteady pressure field predicted by the IDDES inside the duct with an installed fan. The complexity of this field originates from a multimodal content of both the tonal and broadband components of the noise generated by the fan and propagating along the duct. In addition, the instantaneous pressure field is strongly affected by the pressure fluctuations caused by an impingement of turbulent vortical structures on the wall. The latter effect explains why the noise signature is seen much more clearly upstream of the fan where it is not contaminated by turbulent fluctuations. As for the wall-pressure field predicted by the URANS (see Fig. 19b), it completely misses the broadband noise component and has a regular pattern that is typical of the tonal noise.
This effect is illustrated by Figs. 20–23.
Particularly, Fig. 20 presents snapshots of the vorticity magnitude and the streamwise and radial velocities in the duct cross section upstream of the fan (recall that these fields are created by the VSTG based on corresponding RANS solutions slightly upstream of the VSTG region). The figure reveals a significant difference in turbulence impinging on the front surface of the hub and on the rotor blades for the three considered inlets. In the case of the clean (bell-mouth) inlet, only fine-grained turbulent structures confined within a narrow boundary layer on the duct wall are observed. With the T-junction inlet, the presence of large-scale turbulent structures upstream of the fan is evident, and the turbulence “covers” the whole duct cross section. For the inlet formed by the rectangular-to-circular transition, an intermediate situation takes place.
However, as seen from Fig. 21, this difference in the upstream turbulence does not cause any visible alteration of the large-scale or fine- grained turbulence within the fan passage and behind the hub base. This can be explained by a generation of intense vortical structures inside the fan and in the shear layers separated from the trailing edge of the hub. The effect of the shape of the duct inlet on the instantaneous and time-averaged velocity fields (not shown) turns out to be rather weak as well.
The turbulent statistics are more sensitive to the presence of the inlet disturbances. This is seen, for example, in Fig. 22, showing the predicted fields of the resolved TKE in the meridian section of the duct and on a surface of revolution located inside the fan passage; as well as in Fig. 23, presenting distributions of the root mean square of the pressure fluctuations over the fan surface. For the two disturbed inlets, the flow distortions result in increased levels of both TKE in the core of the flow upstream of the fan and the wall-pressure fluctuations on the “front face” of the hub and on the leading edge of the rotor blades. The effect is much stronger in the case of the T-junction inlet.
This, in turn, results in a noticeable alteration of the acoustic pressure field inside the duct, which is illustrated by Fig. 24. Particularly, the figure and (more visibly) corresponding animations of the wall-pressure reveal a noticeable increase of the amplitude of the acoustic waves propagating in the upstream direction in the ducts with the distorted inlets, which is consistent with the higher level of the root mean square of the pressure fluctuations on the fan surface. Again, the effect is more pronounced for the duct with the T-junction inlet.
A direct comparison of the raw wall-pressure spectra obtained in the IDDES of the three considered flows and in the experiment for the microphones located both upstream and downstream of the fan module is shown in Figs. 25 and 26, which present the major outcome of the current work. Note that in these figures, for the upstream microphone (mic.), predicted spectra are corrected with the use of empirical correlation (corr.) of Goody [41] to account for contribution of turbulence of attached boundary layer on the duct wall.
As far as the tonal noise is concerned, an analysis of these spectra reveals the striking difference between the predicted and measured amplitude of the first blade passing frequency order harmonic (f = 2800 Hz). Indeed, in the experiment, a strong tone at this frequency is observed; whereas in the simulations, this tone is almost completely cut off. Note, however, that for the considered ducted fan, the first BPF harmonic cutoff is exactly what has to take place (at least for the case of an axisymmetric bell-mouth inlet) according to the rule of Tyler and Sofrin [9]. So, the presence of this tone in the measured spectra is, most probably, explained by violation of the flow periodicity in the experiment, which may be caused by irregularities of the geometry ignored in the numerical problem setup (first of all, by the presence of the thick power supply cable and the rectangular cavity on the casing surface downstream of the fan).
Leaving aside this difference, the agreement of the simulation results with the data can be assessed as acceptable. Within the resolved frequency range, for all the three considered duct inlets, a significant discrepancy is observed only in the low-frequency end of the spectra of the upstream propagating noise (see Fig. 25). At least partly, this may be caused by stronger reflections of the low-frequency sound waves by the duct inlets in the experiment than in the simulations. Note also that the effect of the shape of the inlet (Fig. 26), which is of primary interest in the present study, is predicted more accurately than the absolute sound power.
Overall, the achieved agreement of the simulation results with the raw experimental spectra of the wall-pressure fluctuations in the considered ducted-fan flows supports credibility of the developed numerical tool. Still, as already mentioned, the comparison of the spectra presented previously cannot be considered as fully consistent because some reflections of the sound waves from the inlets and outlets of the ducts are present in both the experiment and the simulations. For the case of the bell-mouth inlet, a more consistent comparison is performed in the next section based on the linear multiport technique [17–20], which allows extracting the pure (with filtered out hydrodynamic/turbulent fluctuations) acoustic modes propagating upstream and downstream of the fan under reflection-free conditions.
The methodology [17–20] employs a projection of the sound field in the considered duct on a set of cut-on (propagating) acoustic modes that are the eigensolutions of the convective wave equation for the duct. The reflection and transmission of these modes are characterized by a scattering matrix of the test object (fan) and reflection matrices of the duct terminations in experiments or of the computational inlet/outlet boundaries in simulations. As applied to the experiment, the procedure includes two steps.
In the first step, in order to define the scattering and reflection matrices, a set of special experiments is carried out, which use sound fields produced by external sound sources uncorrelated to the sound field of the aeroacoustic source (a detailed description of this step can be found in [17]). Corresponding measurements for the fan with a bell-mouth inlet were performed in [17]. In the second step, the pure modal acoustic signal emitted by the fan is extracted based on the known scattering and reflection matrices and cross correlations of the pressure fluctuations at pairs of distant points sampled without external sources. Details of the postprocessing procedure were presented in [18–20].
As far as postprocessing of the simulation data is concerned, in principle, computing the scattering and reflection matrices could be performed with the use of effectively the same approach as in the experiment, i.e., by means of a set of simulations with known external acoustic sources (this methodology was described in [42]). However, in the present work, a simplified (and computationally much cheaper) approach is adapted. It employs the fact that, thanks to the nonreflecting boundary conditions, the computational inlet/outlet reflection coefficients are small in the whole range of frequencies, except for the lowest frequencies and the vicinity of the cut-on frequencies of the acoustic modes (see the following). This makes neglecting the actual scattering of the fan an acceptable approximation. Hence, both the inflow and outflow reflection coefficients and the amplitudes of the acoustic modes of the source can be extracted from the IDDES unsteady pressure fields with the use of postprocessing, which is basically the same as that used for the experiment [18]. The procedure, however, is adapted to much shorter time samples available in the IDDES as compared to the experiment (∼0.1 s of physical time in the IDDES versus 45 min in the measurements). Namely, in order to reduce the higher “noise” caused by a lower number of averages for computation of the cross spectra because of the short time samples, the procedure employs a much larger set of sampling points available in the simulations. In the postprocessing of the IDDES results, the spectra of the acoustic modes are computed by averaging 50 sets of the spectra obtained based on cross-spectral matrices of the size of 200 × 200; whereas in the experiments [17,19], only a matrix of the size of 16 × 16 is available.
Figure 27 presents the frequency dependencies of the inlet/outlet reflection coefficients for different acoustic modes propagating upstream and downstream of the fan in the duct with a clean bell-mouth inlet obtained based on the IDDES and the experiment. Results are shown for six modes with the lowest cut-on frequencies, namely, the plane wave [mode (0, 0)] propagating at all frequencies; four azimuthal modes (m, 0), with m 1; 2 with cut-on frequencies at 1330 Hz (m 1) and 2220 Hz (m 2); and the first radial mode (0, n), with n 1 (cut-on frequency at 2780 Hz, which is very close to the blade passing frequency of the considered fan). Dashed vertical lines in the figure correspond to these cut-on frequencies. Note that, for the two other inlets, the computational reflection coefficients (not shown) are very close to those for the bell-mouth inlet, whereas the advanced measurements allowing a modal decomposition were performed only for the bell-mouth inlet at frequencies between 500 and 3500 Hz.
The figure demonstrates that the computational reflection coefficient is small everywhere, except for a close neighborhood of cut-on frequencies of corresponding modes and the lowest frequency range (f < 350 Hz) for the outlet reflections. Note that the stronger reflection at the cut-on frequencies is most probably explained by changing the propagation angle: it is normal to the duct axis at cut on; for this reason, the 1-D nonreflective boundary conditions fail, as does the entire modal decomposition. Thus, in general, the results shown in Fig. 28 provide a posteriori justification of neglecting the scattering of the fan in the modal decomposition of the IDDES unsteady pressure field, except for the longest sound waves propagating downstream. For the latter, the reflections by the outflow sponge layer turn out to be very strong, which may result in an inaccuracy of the amplitudes of extracted downstream propagating plane waves (at low frequencies, all the other duct acoustic modes are cut off). Possible reason(s) for this deficiency of the simulations are yet to be understood. As for the sound wave reflections by the duct terminations in the experiment (both at the inlet and at the outlet), they are rather strong over the whole range of frequencies and for all the considered acoustic modes, which suggests that accounting for both the reflection and the scattering effects in the modal decomposition of the measured pressure signals is necessary.
Figure 28 compares the computed and measured amplitudes of the extracted acoustic modes for the bell-mouth inlet and illustrates the effect of the inlet shape on these amplitudes predicted by the IDDES. Major observations based on this figure are as follows.
First, the agreement of the predictions with the experiment for all the acoustic modes is consistent with the raw wall-pressure spectra discussed in Sec. IV.B above. Namely, similar to these spectra (Fig. 25), the major discrepancy of the simulation and experiment resides in the tonal noise of the fan corresponding to the first blade passing frequency order harmonic, which shows up in the experiment and is absent in the computed spectra. The computations also reproduce the spectral shapes and levels of the broadband part of the individual acoustic modes, which is encouraging when considering that these are rather subtle characteristics of the sound field of the source. Unfortunately, the lack of the experimental data at frequencies lower than 500 Hz does not allow suggesting any specific reasons of the discrepancy between the measured and computed raw pressure spectra of the upstream propagating noise observed in the low-frequency range (see Fig. 25).
As far as the effect of the inlet shape predicted by the IDDES is concerned, for the individual modes, it turns out to not be exactly the same as for the wall-pressure spectra (Fig. 26). In particular, for the individual modes, a replacement of the bell-mouth inlet by the T-junction inlet, in a wide frequency range, results in a significant (3–5 dB) increase of the noise propagating both upstream and downstream. In contrast to this, for the wall-pressure spectra, the effect for the downstream direction is almost unnoticeable, which is explained by “contamination” of the wall-pressure signal at the downstream microphone location by turbulent pressure fluctuations.
Finally, at low frequencies (f < 300 Hz), the noise penalty of the T-junction inlet for the upstream direction is very large ( 20 dB) for both the individual acoustic modes and the total wall pressure. For the rectangular/circular inlet, the noise penalty is marginal, except for the low- frequency noise propagating upstream, which is up to 10 dB stronger than in the system with the bell-mouth inlet.
A combined experimental/numerical study of the ducted-fan noise performed in the present work demonstrates the high potential of the hybrid RANS-LES scale resolving approaches to the turbulence representation as a tool for such noise prediction. Furthermore, it shows a high value of invoking a technique of modal decompositions coupled with the acoustic multiport approach. This technique is essential for extracting pure (with filtered out hydrodynamic/turbulent fluctuations) acoustic modes propagating under anechoic conditions, thus facilitating an adequate comparison of predictions and measurements.
It is found out that the effect of the inlet distortions caused by the use of the rectangular/circular transition as an inlet instead of the clean bell-mouth inlet results in a marginal alteration of the fan noise, except for the low-frequency noise propagating in the upstream direction, which increases by up to 10 dB. A noise penalty caused by replacement of the bell-mouth inlet by the inlet with the T junction formed by two circular pipes turns out to be much more severe. It ranges between 3 and 5 dB in a wide frequency range for both upstream and downstream propagating noise, and it reaches about 20 dB at the low-frequency end of the spectra.
In terms of numerical modeling approaches, further work should be directed, first of all, at a substantial mitigation of reflections of the long (comparable with the domain size) waves from the outlet of the computational domain observed in the present simulations. On the experimental side, definition of the scattering and reflection matrices in a frequency range considerably extended toward low frequencies and conducting experiments with different types of inlets are desirable.

A wall-modeled statistically converged Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the turbulent ﬂow in the NASA Source Diagnostic Test turbofan has been successfully performed for the ﬁrst time. A good agreement with aerodynamic measurements is observed for both Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes and LES results, although the LES provides better results in the tip regions where large coherent structures appear and no ﬂow separation on the stator vanes is observed. In the LES the boundary layer naturally transition to turbulence on the blade suc-tion side but remains quasi laminar over most of its pressure side. The rotor-wake turbulence yielding the stage broadband noise is then seen to be quasi isotropic. Transition on the down-stream stator vanes is not triggered by the wake impingement but rather occurs at mid-chord. Finally, acoustics are investigated using both Ffowcs Williams & Hawkings’ and Goldstein’s analogies from the recorded LES noise source on the stator vanes. The latter analogy provides levels closer to the measurements especially at high frequencies, although the results are most likely still inﬂuenced by too coherent rotor tip secondary ﬂow at low frequencies.
Turbofan architecture has evolved toward an increasing contribution of the fan to the thrust. At approach conditions, the fan noise has become one of the main contributors with a main broadband content mostly in the forward arc of the engine [1–3]. The noise generated by the fan will increase even more for future turbo-engines that will involve Ultra-High By-pass Ratio (UHBR) turbofans. For these architectures, fan noise is projected to become the dominant source overall. In a classical turbofan as the present conﬁguration, the interaction between the wake of the rotor and equally-distributed Outlet-Guide Vanes (OGV) has been found to be the dominant mechanism that contributes to fan noise [4,5]. On the one hand, tonal noise can be more easily controlled by clever choice of blade counts according to Tyler & Sofrin rules [6] and taking advantage of the duct ﬁltering to have the ﬁrst Blade Passing Frequency (BPF) cut-off for instance. Moreover proper nacelle and exhaust duct liners can also damp both forward and backward propagating tones [4]. On the other hand, broadband noise has a signiﬁcant contribution much harder to control especially at high frequencies given the high number of cut-on modes for modern engines with low hub-to-tip ratio. Yet, with future noise regulations for commercial aircrafts [7,8], it becomes mandatory to get a better understanding of the noise generation and propagation for fan and OGV interaction broadband noise in order to be able to properly guide further noise reduction technology development.
Progress in High Performance Computing (HPC) has allowed for the correct prediction of complex ﬂows around isolated parts of turbomachines with Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), unsteady RANS, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and high-ﬁdelity Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) as shown in reviews from Tucker [9] and McMullan et al. [10]. However, only the latter two methods (LES and DNS) can provide the multi-scale noise sources that yield broadband noise. A recent review from Gourdain et al. [11] gives an overview of LES industrial compressor ﬂows and reports simulations with full stages highlighting the cost of LES for multistage compressors [12,13]. But all these simulations involved low-pressure compressor with small blade spans, reduced rotor-stator distances and moderate Reynolds numbers based on the chord. Only de Laborderie et al. [12] considered the noise generation, but stressed the diﬃculties of predictions associated with limited passage simulations. More recently high-pressure turbines have been considered that involve both higher Mach and Reynolds numbers [14], and dealt with their noise generation and the propagation of combustion noise through them [15].
In that context, the “Fan Noise Source Diagnostic Test” (SDT) experimental set-up was investigated by NASA providing an extensive database of aerodynamic sources and aeroacoustic diagnostics of the broadband fan/OGV interaction mechanism [16–18]. This comprehensive study is dedicated to the validation of numerical and analytical methods and has recently become an AIAA benchmark case for fan broadband noise.
The present work focuses on the only Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of this conﬁguration at the moment, in combination with acoustic analogies for noise prediction to investigate the rotor/stator interaction mechanism. It provides an in-depth analysis of the instantaneous aerodynamic features of this turbofan conﬁguration and the comparison of two acoustic analogies for noise propagation. This investigation is the continuation of the preliminary work presented by Leonard et al. with converged ﬂow and acoustic statistics [19]. In the latter, the streamwise turbulent length scale was extracted from the LES results and used in Hanson’s [20] and Posson’s models [21] to predict the far-ﬁeld noise. The prime focus has been on the noise generated by the fan/ OGV pressure ﬂuctuations and its link with the impingement of the passing turbulent rotor wakes. A precise description of the state of turbulence reaching the stator vanes leading edge is therefore mandatory, which strongly justiﬁed the LES. The NASA experiment is summarized in the next section. The complete numerical model and parameters are then provided. Finally both aerodynamic and acoustic results from the LES are shown.
As part of the NASA advanced Subsonic Technology Noise Reduction Program, several experiments [16–18,22,23] have been carried out on the Source Diagnostic Test rig presented in Fig. 1(a) involving different geometries and counts of the rotor blades and stator outlet vanes [22]. The conﬁguration studied here is the baseline conﬁguration designed by General Electric Aircraft Engines which is composed of 22 rotor blades (R4) and 54 radial stator vanes (Fig. 1(b)). This 1/5th scale model fan stage is representative of the secondary stream of current High Bypass-Ratio turbofan engines. Note that the experimental set-up does not involve a core ﬂow.
The fan stage has been tested in take-off and approach conditions, but only the approach condition that has the most exten- sive experimental data set has been simulated numerically. Free-stream Mach number of 0.10 is imposed, to achieve acoustic ﬂight effect and to provide far-ﬁeld acoustic data representative of real take-off and approach conditions [18]. The rotational speed at approach is 7808 rpm corresponding to 61.7% of the rotor design speed.
The overall test program had many phases, including detailed ﬂow ﬁeld diagnostic measurements using laser Doppler and hot- wire anemometry [17,23] and acoustic power measurements [18].
 
To decrease the computational costs of the simulations, only a periodic portion of the fan stage is simulated. Since the rotor- stator interface condition used for the LES simulation requires to have domains of the same angular extent in the rotor and stator parts, the number of outlet guide vanes has been modiﬁed from 54 to 55 allowing a 2𝜋∕11 angular periodicity in both
domains. The geometrical transformation has been performed as in Refs. [14,24] adjusting the vane aspect ratios to maintain the same solidity and stay as close as possible to the experimental operating point (see Table 1). Using the OPTIBRUI platform for the analytical prediction of axial fan noise [19,25], it was veriﬁed that similar broadband noise levels should be expected as similar ranges of cut-on modes are found for both conﬁgurations. The computational domain shown in Fig. 2 not only contains the fan stage but also the nacelle and outside ﬂow. The deﬁnition of the domain, avoids the need of an inlet condition inside of the turbofan which may affect the acoustic propagation in the nacelle and allows the ﬂow to establish itself from the free ﬂow and the fan rotational speed like in the experimental wind tunnel. Downstream the exiting jet and the mixing layer will also be accounted for in the simulation which also prevents from modifying the acoustic transmission at the end of the nacelle.
The domain is divided in two parts: the stator domain is composed of the outside region and the vane row, while the rotor domain is limited to the rotor row and the rotor wake development region. The interfaces between the two parts are shown by the brown surfaces in Fig. 2.
The unstructured mesh used in the present study for both RANS and LES simulations is shown along a blade-to-blade view at mid-channel height in Fig. 3. The spatial discretization around the blades and in the wakes of the blades has been a prime focus: 8 layers of prisms have been imposed on the blades and vane skin in order to have a good discretization of the near-wall region. The tip region is discretized with 8 layers of prisms and an average of 7 tetrahedral elements to reach the casing (about 15 overall cells) which is more than twice as ﬁne than the extra ﬁne-tripped LBM simulation on this conﬁguration [26]. The minimum size of the ﬁrst prism layer reaches 0.0007 rotor chords (0.05 mm).
The cell size in the rotor wake is progressively increased until reaching the rotor-stator interface where a constant mesh size of 0.02 rotor chords is used. Upstream of the rotor blades the mesh is uniform and coarsen up to a mesh size of 0.05 rotor chords at the entrance of the nacelle. For the outside domain, the nacelle nearby region and the mixing layers are reﬁned. However, the grid is still relatively coarse compared to the inside, the goal being to obtain the mean effect of the mixing layer and not necessary to resolve the turbulent structures precisely. The resulting mesh is composed of 75 million cells (15 million nodes) of which over 95% are used to discretize the inside domain. The domain cut-off frequency is estimated to be about 10 kHz at the inlet interface (upstream of the rotor) and 20 kHz 1 stator chord downstream of the stator. The minimum cut-off frequency at the blade skin (used for far-ﬁeld propagation) is about 35 kHz and 30 kHz for the rotor and stator respectively.
parallel code coupler OpenPALM [28] which interpolates and exchanges the residuals at each iteration over overlapping grids [29].
The numerical scheme for the present LES is an explicit Lax-Wendroff second order scheme both in space and time. The time step for the simulation has been set to approximately 2.5 × 10−5 ms to have 14, 000 iterations per blade passage. The sub-grid scale model used is the Wall-Adapting Local Eddy-viscosity model (WALE) that provides the proper turbulence decay toward the walls. As for the turbine cases [14], a log-law model (which switches to a linear model for y+ < 11.445) is applied on all
walls to be consistent with the above y+ values and to ensure a physical friction on the walls. The dimensionless wall-normal distance y+ of the ﬁrst cell at the wall computed from an average solution from the LES is presented in Fig. 4. The Thanks to the prisms layers, the y+ is under 50 on the whole blade skin, whereas it is coarser on the hub and casing surfaces where prisms have not been used. At the inlet and outlet, Navier-Stokes characteristic non-reﬂective boundary conditions are used combined with a sponge layer to avoid spurious reﬂections from vortical ﬂuctuations [30].
The end of the transient period and the beginning of the statistics recording has been chosen according not only to the stabi- lization of the operating point but also to a method based on local quantities from Mockett et al. for statistical error estimation of ﬁnite time signals [31]. To assess this local convergence, several pressure probes have been used in various regions to ensure that the turbulence actually reached a statistically converged regime everywhere. Three convergence plots of those probes are shown in Fig. 5.
After a transient regime of about 4 rotation times, statistics have been extracted from the simulation during approximately 9 rotations (about 70 ms or 18 blade passages). The statistical error estimated on the mean and the standard deviation are around 0.2% and 3.0% respectively in the fan stage and around 0.2% and 6.0% in the jet mixing layer. Overall the convergence of the
statistics is very good on both the mean and the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the ﬂow variables. For acoustic post-processing, wall-pressure ﬂuctuations have also been extracted during that time every 20 time steps of the simulation (which corresponds approximately to a 2, 000 kHz sampling rate) on the rotor and stator blades.
The full simulation, including the transient regime, took 15 days on 3000 CPUs on the supercomputer Mammoth-MP2 from Université de Sherbrooke (1500 CPUs for the static domain, and 1500 CPUs for the rotor domain).
The mass-ﬂow rate and total pressure ratio computed from the two simulations are compared in Table 1 with measurements obtained by Hughes et al. [16]. The mass-ﬂow rate differs from experiments by less than 3% whereas the pressure ratio differs less than 1%. Similar RANS results were obtained by the various participants of the benchmark with different codes and turbu-lence models. As expected, predicted performance is different because the simulated tip clearance corresponds to the sideline “hot” geometry with maximum loading that does not account for the same blade deformation in rotation. Moreover, the slight geometry modiﬁcations performed on the stator vane count have a minor impact on the fan stage operating conditions.
Iso-contours of Mach number are presented on blade-to-blade surfaces at three channel heights in Fig. 6. Flow is moving
from left to right. Instantaneous LES ﬁelds are shown in the left column. The mean ﬁelds for the LES and the RANS simulations are seen in the center and right columns respectively. The instantaneous LES snapshots clearly illustrate the turbulent nature of the ﬂow in the stage. At all heights, a quasi laminar ﬂow is seen on the pressure side of the rotor blade and a turbulent boundary layer on its suction side, becoming thicker with increasing radius (increased relative speeds). The turbulent rotor wakes are then convected toward the stator vanes. As was found in the CME2 compressor simulations in similar ﬂow conditions with three different codes [12,32,33], the wake impingement does not trigger the transition to turbulence at the stator leading edge (too low Reynolds number), which rather occurs at vane mid-chord. Moreover from the instantaneous snapshots at 50% channel height, an intermittent ﬂow detachment at the leading edge of the rotor is seen to shed vortices that graze along the blade suction sides. A complex turbulent ﬂow behavior is seen at 97% channel height caused by the tip gap vortices with some intermittent ﬂow separation on one stator-vane pressure side. Note that similar ﬂow behavior has been reported by Casalino et al. using a hybrid Lattice-Boltzmann/Very Large Eddy Simulation (LBM/VLES) model of the baseline SDT conﬁguration [26]. Yet, in this hybrid model a tripping device needed to be introduced close to the blade leading edge over the whole span to trigger transition to turbulence and yield the proper turbulent levels in the wake. No tip gap caused by the voxel resolution could also be captured in the coarsest simulations.
The mean ﬂow described by both numerical approaches is very similar at midspan. Nevertheless, the LES boundary layers are thinner on the rotor blades (no recirculation bubble as in the RANS) yielding slightly thinner rotor wakes with less velocity deﬁcits than in the RANS results. This effect is emphasized at the hub where the wakes are clearly thinner in the LES than in the RANS simulation. For both spanwise locations, the mean ﬂow in the stator domain is very close in the RANS simulation to the one found in LES in spite of the very different approach used for the rotor-stator interface. Close to the tip, however, the mean ﬂow is signiﬁcantly different in the two simulations. On the one hand, the RANS calculation predicts a large ﬂow detachment on the rotor blade leading edge which interacts strongly with the tip leakage ﬂow. On the other hand, the deviation induced by the rotor tip ﬂow has an effect on the stator ﬂow resulting in important ﬂow separations at the tip of the outlet guide vanes that do not appear in the LES, which is again quite similar to what was found in the CME2 compressor case [12,32,33]. It should be emphasized that such ﬂow separations predicted by the RANS simulations were neither observed experimentally nor in the tripped LBM/VLES case.
Fig. 7 presents the ﬁeld of the normalized component of axial velocity in an axial cut at mid-distance between the rotor trailing edge and the stator leading edge where hot-wire (HW) measurements have been performed by Podboy et al. [23]. The values are normalized by the respective (experimental, RANS or LES) mean axial velocity at the axial plane of interest in order to take into account deviations from the experimental operational point given in Table 1. The twisting effect on the rotor wake in the interstage by the differential transport of the wake vorticity by the mean swirl is well captured by all simulations. On the upper part of the channel, the radial oscillations (S-shape) observed in the RANS wake proﬁle (seen in all benchmark RANS simulations) are the consequence of the tip ﬂow detachment from the leading-edge and is not present in the LES. Both in the LES and RANS the top 10% of the channel are strongly affected by the tip leakage ﬂow. The strong axial velocity deﬁcit results in a higher ﬂow blockage. The ﬂow blockage is illustrated in Fig. 9 by measuring the mass-ﬂow rate m˙ for several segments of span h/H% and computing it in experiments assuming that the density proﬁles follow the same linear trend from hub to casing as in the computations and that experimental mass-ﬂow rate of 26.44 is recovered when adding all segments.
The mass-ﬂow rate from the computations closely follow experiments over most of the duct section. In the top 10% the mass-ﬂow rate drops about 20 and 10% for RANS and LES respectively which may still suggest an insuﬃcient mesh resolution in the tip clearance or in the casing boundary layer. Yet as mentioned above, the different geometry used in the simulation does not take into account the same blade deformation in rotation and thus, the gap is different than in the experiments. Finally the LES normalized axial velocity outside the wake agrees well with experiments, even though the wake deﬁcit is under-predicted by 5%.
The unsteady nature of the LES also allows to obtain statistics of the resolved turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations: the three normalized RMS % components of the velocity are presented in Fig. 8 along with the experimental results. The turbulence pattern obtained by LES, for both the wakes and the tip secondary ﬂow, shows a good agreement with the experiments. In fact, not only the turbulence intensity is accurately reproduced but also the distribution on the three components is very similar all across the channel height with hardly any turbulence near the hub and transition to turbulence at mid-span.
Moreover in the wake, the three components have similar levels in most of the channel height, the tangential component being the lowest of the three as highlighted in another turbofan stage studied by Bonneau et al. [34] with a ZDES approach. Close to the casing, the tip clearance ﬂows cause a noticeable decrease of the radial ﬂuctuations in favor of the axial and tangential components as already shown by Leonard et al. (Fig. 14 in Ref. [19]). Similar results have also been reported by Casalino et al. with a LBM/VLES approach (Fig. 7 in Ref. [26]). The anisotropy invariants I2 and I3 are computed in the rotor wake at several radial and axial positions and depicted in the Lumley triangle in Fig. 10 [35]. The invariants illustrate preferential directions of the turbulent stress ﬁeld. They are computed as
where tr denotes the trace, det its determinant and A is the non-dimensional form of the anisotropy tensor with components deﬁned as
where the overline denotes the temporal average, u is the velocity ﬂuctuation of the respective component and 𝛿 is the Kro- necker delta. As expected from the levels of the RMS components, all values are close to the isotropic limit.
One advantage of LES is to give access to detailed information on the turbulence development and can help understand its inﬂuence on the noise sources of the turbofan operating at approach condition. The turbulent structures are identiﬁed using an iso-surface of Q-criterion computed in the rotor reference frame in Fig. 11. Q stands for the second invariant of the velocity- gradient tensor. Each blade side is shown from its leading edge.
As already mentioned for the instantaneous Mach number contours, while the boundary layer on the rotor-blade suction side is turbulent starting from the leading edge, the favorable pressure gradient on the pressure side limits the development of the turbulence (quasi laminar along the whole blade span): the boundary layer is initially laminar and some turbulent spots can be localized by the appearance of vertical vortex structures on the upper part of the blade only. On 30% of the blade span close to the hub, hardly any turbulent structures are visible on the pressure side revealing that the boundary layer stays in a quasi laminar state. The temperature contours coloring the iso-Q further stress that high ﬂow shearing and skin friction typical of turbulent ﬂows only occur on the upper part of both sides of the rotor blades. In the lower part of the channel shown in Fig. 7, the blades generate a very thin wake and low velocity deﬁcit. The laminar to turbulent boundary layer transition cannot be captured by the present RANS approach as it assumes the boundary layer to be turbulent right from the leading edge. The early boundary layer development yields larger wake width in the lower part of the channel in Fig. 7. The tip leakage generates large coherent structures that interact with the pressure side provoking the large velocity deﬁcit in the upper part of the channel.
Dynamic Mode Decompositions (DMD) has been performed on the pressure signals on the rotor blade skin in the rotating reference frame [36]. This signal processing method allows to detect and extract a set of dominant modes in a given complex ﬂow [15]. Fig. 12(a) shows the mode associated with the relative vane passing frequency (VPF). Note that the rotor blade is again seen from its leading edge. In the lower part of the blade pressure side where the boundary layer is laminar, a periodic wave going upstream can be seen, representing the acoustic pressure wave generated by wake interaction on the stator vanes traveling upstream. On the suction side a similar pattern can be guessed but it is hidden in the hydrodynamic ﬂuctuations and turbulent vortices.
Further evidence of the above ﬂow and acoustic features is provided by the wall-pressure power spectral densities (PSD) presented in Fig. 12(b). These PSD are computed from the pressure signals of two probes in both the laminar (15% of blade span) and turbulent parts (85% of blade span) of the pressure side of the rotor blade. On the one hand, the spectrum of the probe located in the laminar region has much lower levels with an early and quick roll-off at mid-frequency. It also presents a hump around the stator passing frequency. On the other hand, in the turbulent region the spectrum is broadband with no particular tonal frequency. This acoustic tone is again masked by the turbulent pressure ﬂuctuations.
The unsteady pressure recorded on the stator vane skin has been used for far-ﬁeld noise prediction with two different analo- gies, the Ffowcs Williams & Hawkings’ (FWH) analogy in free ﬁeld, and the extension of Goldstein’s analogy to annular ducts [37].
The FWH analogy allows to directly propagate the stator wall-pressure ﬂuctuations to the far-ﬁeld without any duct reﬂec- tions in order to then compute the acoustic power. Indeed from the resulting acoustic pressure p′(x, t) a surface integration over an upstream half-sphere S− and a downstream half-sphere S+ is performed to evaluate the intake and exhaust power:
dropped from the duct eigenfunction Em,𝜇 as it is a real function. In Eq. (10), the subscript I represents the reference coordinate system I , the coordinate vector xI0 = (rI0, 𝜃I0, xI0) constitutes the coordinates of the cell-centers on the surface elements.
Both analogies can be used following two different approaches. The ﬁrst one is obtained by computing the acoustic power
from Eq. (3) or Eq. (6) for FWH and Goldstein’s analogy respectively) independently for each blade, and then doing a summation over all of them. This calculation does not take into account any blade-to-blade correlation as the phase is lost when computing the norm in Eqs. (3) and (6). The second approach takes into account blade-to-blade correlations. For the FWH free-
ﬁeld analogy, the acoustic power S± (𝜔) in Eq. (3) is directly computed from the pressure ﬂuctuations p′ from Eq. (4) from all the
the blades in the computational domain and then calculating the norm of the expected value. Last, the pressure amplitudes are scaled by the ratio of total vane count and computed vane number. The phase shift of the vanes that are not directly computed is not yet taken into account in this work.
The results from the FWH analogy (noted as FWH Uncorr. and FWH Corr. for the uncorrelated and correlated summation respectively) and for Goldstein’s in-duct analogy (noted as Goldstein Uncorr. and Goldstein Corr.) are compared with the mea- surements [18] in Fig. 13(a) and (b). In the experiments, sound power is measured upstream by means of an acoustic screen to hide the downstream contributions. Then this contribution is subtracted from the acoustic power measured without the screen to get the exhaust information. The mock-up was also run without the stator row to measure the contribution from the fan only. The latter is then subtracted from the acoustic power measured with the fan-OGV conﬁguration to isolate the OGV contribution. Unfortunately, the experimental rotor-alone broadband noise levels eventually overtake the fan-OGV noise lev- els at some frequencies. This behavior is potentially caused by the strong swirling ﬂow at the nacelle exit interacting with the pylon.
The numerical predictions using the pressure ﬂuctuations on the stator as equivalent dipoles for both analogies provide an overall good agreement with experiment both in terms of levels and shape. The largest differences in levels (up to 10 dB higher than the fan-OGV measurements) are seen at low frequencies which highlights that additional noise mechanisms may be present in the simulation. Leonard et al. [19] already showed that the rotor-alone predictions were overpredicted because of too large coherent structures present in the tip gap region (under-resolved region in the LES). Such structures typically yield low-frequency humps observed in low-speed fans [39], which could correspond to the hump above 2 kHz in Fig. 13(a) and (b). Moreover, the differences with experiments are higher toward the intake since the reﬂections on the rotor blades are not taken into account. The effect of the reﬂections was shown analytically for the present conﬁguration by Posson and Moreau [40] and numerically by Casalino et al. [26].
The results obtained with Goldstein’s analogy extended to annular ducts are closer to the experimental data, especially toward the exhaust demonstrating the limitation of using a free-ﬁeld acoustic propagation for this conﬁguration. The nacelle plays a crucial ﬁltering role on the wave propagation: different duct-modes with distinct energy levels are cut-off yielding the sharper spectral decay at high frequencies seen both experimentally and numerically compared to the free-ﬁeld case. According to the number of blades and vanes, the BPF and its ﬁrst harmonics should be cut-off. However, the peak at 2863 Hz which corresponds to the BPF is visible with both approaches because only 5 vanes have been simulated and the Tyler & Sofrin rules [6] only apply for a full (axisymmetric) conﬁguration. Nonetheless, the peak is reduced by 10 dB in the second approach when the correlation of the 5 vanes is taken into account. The spurious peak also contributes to the above low-frequency over-prediction which shows the very strong sensitivity of the destructive interference in tone cut-off conditions. Finally the current agreement
with experiments at the exhaust is similar to what Casalino et al. obtained with the hybrid LBM/VLES approach (Fig. 12 in Ref. [26]), where the LES yields a better high-frequency decay because of the higher resolution of the vane noise sources.
The Large Eddy Simulation of the scale-model simpliﬁed NASA SDT turbofan has been successfully achieved for the ﬁrst time at approach condition for the reference stator-vane case. This simulation has been performed on the complete nacelle and fan- OGV experimental set-up with a slightly modiﬁed vane count to reduce the computational domain in the azimuthal direction.
The simulation was initialized from a preliminary steady RANS simulation of the same set-up using a k − 𝜔 SST turbulence
model. This conﬁguration is of particular interest since it provides a set of detailed experimental data not only for aerodynamics but also for acoustics. It is then a good test case to evaluate the ability of LES to reproduce the turbulent ﬂow in a fan stage but also to test different acoustic models for noise emission and propagation.
Both RANS and LES results have shown a good agreement with experiments on the mean aerodynamic ﬂow properties. However, the RANS simulation presents a leading-edge recirculation bubble at the tip of the rotor blade yielding a downstream S-shape rotor wake, which is not observed in the LES that only presents some intermittent vortex shedding grazing on the suction side. Similarly some ﬂow separation is observed at the tip of the stator vanes in the RANS results, which is neither found in the experiments nor in the LES. Noticeably the LES transitions to turbulence on the rotor-blade suction side close to the leading edge because of the sharp local acceleration, which could not be obtained in less resolved hybrid LBM/VLES results without tripping. The comparison of turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations with hot-wire measurements has shown that the LES also gives an accurate representation of turbulence in the wake. Noticeably, the bottom part of the wake is essentially laminar and much thinner in the LES than in the RANS that assumes turbulent ﬂow over the whole passage. From the RMS components and the anisotropy invariants, the turbulence is shown to be mostly isotropic in the wake which conﬁrms the validity of this commonly made hypothesis in most analytical models such as Hanson’s or Posson’s. Similarly to what was found in low-pressure compressors at similar Reynolds number based on the chord, the transition on the stator vanes is not directly triggered by the rotor wake impingement but rather occurs at mid-chord.
Finally, the LES has the advantage to provide unsteady wall-pressure signals on the stator vanes, which can be used as equivalent noise sources for both Ffowcs Williams & Hawkings’ analogy in free space, and the generalized Goldstein’s analogy extended to annular ducts. The sound power level spectra obtained with both analogies present the right trend but over- estimate the noise level at low frequency, most likely because the present tip gap is larger than in the experiments and the tip ﬂow structures are still under-resolved in the present detailed simulation. Moreover, the spurious low-frequency tonal noise may be caused by the limited number of blades in the present model. The correlated addition of the acoustic power for Goldstein’s analogy noticeably reduces the level of this tone. Yet at mid and high frequencies (up to 20 kHz at least), the results from Goldstein’s analogy match the experimental OGV spectra well both in terms of levels and shape, much better than the FWH results that overpredict the radiated sound power, which stresses the importance of accounting for the decay of cut-off modes in this frequency range taking place within the duct. An improved agreement over a larger frequency range is also observed compared with the less resolved hybrid LBM/VLES results with tripping.

This study introduces an analytical model aiming at predicting the tonal acoustic sources generated and radiated by the rotor–stator interaction in a fan stage. This model is able to cope with complex three-dimensional stator geometries and it fully accounts for cascade effects, characteristic of modern fan stages. It is based on a proper description of the rotor wake coupled with an analytic cascade response function and with an acoustic analogy. The proposed model is validated for the ﬁrst time against acoustic sources and sound power measurements, on the Advanced Noise Control Fan from NASA. On this conﬁg-uration representative of an actual fan stage, the model is shown to predict tonal sources and powers accurately, in function of the rotational velocity and of the stator-vane count. Another realistic conﬁguration, namely the low-pressure CME2 research compressor, is then considered in order to demonstrate the suitability of the model to be used as a design tool in an industrial context. A parametric study concerning both the stator vane sweep and lean angles is performed on this rotor–stator stage. The model produces predictions consistent with studies from literature, quantifying the effectiveness of swept and leaned vanes as a tonal noise reduction mechanism. This parametric study allows deﬁning an optimal stator design for minimal noise emission.
In the future of aircraft propulsion, the Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBR) turbofan architecture is promising as it leads to an overall efﬁciency improvement and to a decrease of pollutants emission with respect to the current generation of aeroengines. In particular, the gain in propulsive efﬁciency is partly reached with a larger fan diameter. However the larger nacelle associated with this conﬁguration implies a drag increase that is detrimental to the overall engine efﬁciency. Thus a UHBR nacelle has to be shortened. This in turn induces shorter rotor–stator distances, more pronounced inlet and outlet distorsions and less efﬁcient passive treatment that reduces fan noise propagating outside of the nacelle. Therefore, in the frame of fan noise source reduction, the current work aims at improving fan noise modelling. As stated by several authors,
e.g. Groeneweg et al. [1], Envia et al. [2] and Peake and Parry [3], the interaction of fan wakes with the downstream outlet guide vanes (OGVs) represents the main source of fan noise, a trend growing with the expected decrease of the rotor–stator spacing in UHBR. A blade wake is composed of a mean velocity deﬁcit creating a periodic ﬂuctuation in time and in the azimuthal direction in the stator reference frame. Convected with the mean ﬂow, these wakes interact with the vane leading edges generating pressure ﬂuctuations on the whole vane surfaces. This unsteady loading radiates acoustic waves propagating within the nacelle, at the blade passing frequency (BPF) and its higher harmonics. This mechanism corresponds to the rotor–stator interaction tonal noise. Moreover turbulent structures present in blade wakes, upon interaction with the downstream vanes, generate random wall pressure ﬂuctuations that radiate to form the rotor–stator interaction broadband noise [4]. The current study focuses on fan tonal noise as it becomes crucial in UHBR because of the less efﬁcient passive treatment as well as the decrease of the rotor–stator gap creating a larger interaction of the rotor wakes with the stator.
Several types of Computational Aero-Acoustics (CAA) methods aiming at the prediction of fan tonal noise have been developed [2]. Among them, a ﬁrst category uses Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations to compute the viscous blade wakes downstream of the rotor. This vortical excitation is then imposed at the inlet of a stator domain on which the linearised Euler equations are numerically solved. This approach has for instance been implemented within the LINFLUX code, that computes the vane row acoustic response in the frequency domain, by Montgomery and Verdon [5], Verdon [6] and Prasad and Verdon [7]. The method of Atassi et al. [8] also uses linearised Euler equations to predict the acoustic response of the vane cascade. With such an approach, actual vane and duct geometries are accounted for in the source and near-ﬁeld acoustic prediction. A second category of methods, based on the Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier– Stokes (URANS) equations, has been successfully surveyed by several authors [9–12]. These approaches allow considering a realistic ﬂow, particularly the vane mean loading and the inﬂuence of the stator on the rotor wakes, in the acoustic pre- diction. However the computational cost associated with these numerical methods still prevents them to be routinely used in an industrial context, especially for pre-design and parametric studies. This is the reason why analytical approaches represent an interesting compromise as they provide fast and exact solutions of simpliﬁed problems. The response function of Amiet [13], extended by Paterson and Amiet [14], Moreau et al. [15] and Roger et al. [16], deals with the interaction of an aerodynamic gust with a single airfoil in free-ﬁeld. In this model, suited for low solidity rotors without external casings such as helicopter rotors, propellers, contra-rotating open rotors and ventilators, the airfoil is modelled as an inﬁnitely thin ﬂat plate immersed in a uniform inviscid ﬂow with zero incidence (neither vane camber nor mean loading). The asymptotic analyses of Myers and Kerschen [17] and Evers and Peake [18] allow considering some mean loading effects in the response. For low solidity ducted fans, as proposed by Glegg [19] for instance, the isolated response can be coupled with Green's function tailored to a duct developed by Goldstein [20]. However cascade effect, i.e. the inﬂuence of the neighbouring vanes on the source generation and radiation of a given vane, has to be considered in a modern fan stage where vanes overlap. For the interaction of a gust with a rectilinear ﬂat plat cascade, the models are based on the resolution of an integral equation, using the acceleration potential method [21] or the lifting surfaces methods [22], leading to the LINSUB code for instance [23–26]. Namba and Schulten's and Zhang et al.'s model [27–29], also based on a lifting surface method, account for an annular cascade and the casing walls, but are limited to vanes with zero stagger angle and no radial geometrical variations. Another group of cascade models is based on a closed-form analytical solution of the integral equation with the Wiener– Hopf technique, successively extended by Mani and Hovray [30], Koch [31], Peake [32] and Glegg [33]. Posson et al. [34] extended Glegg's work to the calculation of the unsteady vane loading and of the pressure ﬁeld in the vane passage. In the cascade model of Hanson [4], also based on the Wiener–Hopf technique and Glegg's blade response, the strip theory approach allows accounting for variable stator geometry along the duct height, but the acoustic power is evaluated in free ﬁeld and decorrelated from one strip to another one. Finally, another approach consists in considering the actual annular distribution of acoustic sources on the stator vanes as well as their radiation within an annular duct, contrary to the free ﬁeld acoustic radiation from a rectilinear cascade. In the model of Ventres et al. [35], the unsteady vane loading is obtained via a numerical resolution of the integral equation then radiated with the annular duct Green's function of Goldstein [20]. This model, developed for fan tonal and broadband noise applications, has been extended by Meyer and Envia [36], Nal- lasamy and Envia [37] and Grace et al. [38]. Finally the model of Posson et al. [39], using a purely analytical solution for the acoustic sources and the in-duct radiation with Goldstein's analogy, has been applied and validated for fan broadband noise predictions.
Tonal fan noise modelling is challenging mainly because the sound emission is sensitive to the stator geometry and because the excitation and the vane response are correlated along the duct height. This is why the present model, based on the analytical cascade response function of Posson et al. [34], uses a radial strip approach in order to consider a complex stator geometry, with variable stagger, sweep and lean angles for the vanes. Moreover this cascade response is coupled with Green's function developed by Goldstein [20] so as to account for the annular duct geometry and an axial mean ﬂow in the acoustic propagation. The aerodynamic excitation is decomposed into skewed gusts that are coupled with the 3D cascade response to ensure a correct representation of the radially correlated vane response. Although this tonal noise model has already been used in preliminary studies [40,41], the ﬁrst objective of the paper consists in performing a complete description of this cascade based acoustic model, in focusing particularly on the complex stator geometry and the aero- dynamic excitation. Then Section 3 aims at validating the model against experimental data collected on the Advanced Noise Control Fan (ANCF) conﬁguration [42,43]. The latter is representative of an actual fan stage of a modern aeroengine and exhaustive available datasets allow performing trends with the vane count and the rotational velocity. Finally the model is evaluated in Section 4 on the CME2 axial compressor stage [44], at higher reduced frequencies than on the ANCF conﬁg- uration. Parametric studies on the vane geometry are performed in order to highlight the model capability of handling complex stator conﬁgurations and of determining an optimal acoustic design.
In this section, the cascade based acoustic model of Posson et al. [34,39], originally developed for fan broadband noise applications, is generalised to fan tonal noise prediction. The conﬁguration treated here, represented in Fig. 1, is a rotor– stator stage mounted in an annular duct. The cylindrical reference frames Rr ðxd; rd; θrÞ and Rdðxd; rd; θdÞ are direct and linked to the rotor and the stator respectively, with xd directed downstream. The rotor is composed of B blades and the stator of V vanes. In order to account for complex blade and vane geometries present in modern turbofan engines, i.e. with stagger, sweep and lean angles varying along the duct height, both the rotor and stator rows are split into annular strips along the span. Each strip at radius rd is then unwrapped into a local rectilinear geometry represented in Fig. 2. The direct Cartesian reference frame R0ðxd; yd; zdÞ is attached to the rectilinear cascade of inﬁnite span ﬂat plates. Following a literature review, it appears necessary to propose a uniﬁed formulation of the equations in order to account for any rotational direction. Indeed,
Fig. 2(a) corresponds to the conﬁguration with the rotational speed Ωo0 used in the model of Posson et al. [34] for instance, whereas Fig. 2(b) represents the conﬁguration treated in the model of Ventres et al. [35] as well as in its further extensions [36,45] with Ω40. The frames Rr and Rd are linked by the following relation, Ω being a relative speed from now on:
In the Rd reference frame, the geometrical sweep φ^ ðrdÞ and lean ψ^ ðrdÞ angles of the vane are deﬁned in Figs. 3 and 4, looking successively from the side and the front of the cascade. It is worth noting that φ^ is independent of the rotational velocity sign, whereas the sign of ψ^ changes with the sign of Ω, as depicted in Fig. 4. Moreover an arbitrary ðyf ; zf Þ surface is introduced, viewed from the side in Fig. 3 (dotted grey line), on which the aerodynamic data (mean ﬂow and rotor wake) are extracted to be input within the model. For an efﬁcient interaction modelling, this surface has to follow the vane leading edge radial evolution. 
The change of coordinates is chosen to only deal with direct reference frames thus implying the direction yd in R0 to be in the opposite direction than θd (in Rd), for any sign of the rotational velocity (see Fig. 2). In R0 the sign of the vane stagger angle is always opposed to the sign of Ω. The cascade reference frame Rc is ﬁxed such as yc is in the yd direction. This imposes yc to be oriented from the pressure side (PS) to the suction side (SS) of the vane for a negative rotational velocity (Fig. 2(a)), and in the opposite direction (from SS to PS) for a positive rotational velocity (Fig. 2(b)). For both conﬁgurations, the vane number ν increases in the yc direction similarly to the convention adopted by Glegg [33].
The rotor wakes formed at the blade trailing edges are convected with the subsonic mean ﬂow and interact with the downstream stator vanes, creating unsteady wall pressure ﬂuctuations that correspond to the tonal acoustic sources. More precisely, following the deﬁnition of Sutliff et al. [42], the aerodynamic excitation corresponds to the velocity component w normal to the direction given by the mass-averaged absolute ﬂow angle α (see Fig. 2). Assuming that this excitation is identical from one rotor blade to another one, it becomes 2π=B-periodic in the azimuthal direction as well as periodic in time with the blade passing pulsation qBΩ. Using the following convention for the temporal Fourier series:
From Eq. (7) only the coefﬁcient W q contributes to the cascade response at the qth harmonic of the blade passing frequency (BPF). Because of the no-slip condition on both the hub and casing walls, the absolute ﬂow velocity is zero in a ducted fan stage at these locations. Thus the upwash velocity can be 
This 3D decomposition aims at a better representation of the incident perturbation than the 2D approach described with Eq. (7). Indeed the latter implies that the radial evolution of the wake properties are only treated by variations of amplitudes with the parameter rd. A 3D decomposition allows accounting for the radial gradients of the perturbation [46] as well as for the radial correlation known to be signiﬁcative for a tonal noise excitation [47]. The principle of the 3D decomposition proposed in Eq. (9) has been validated in [40] but it has never been confronted to an experimental database.
From aerodynamic measurements or simulations, the mean velocity proﬁle U as well as the upwash w decomposed in Section 2.2 are extracted in the ðyf ; zf Þ surface introduced in Section 2.1. As a general rule for the interaction modelling, it is recommended to consider the excitation as close as possible to the vane leading edges, thus implying [48]. A particular feature of the present generalised acoustic model consists in dealing with a non-zero radial velocity component Ur in the duct reference frame Rd in order to improve the realistic ﬂow modelling. From the mean velocity vector UðUxf ; Uyf ; Uzf Þ in Rf, the velocity components in the cascade reference frame Rc are, using Eqs. (2) and (3):
Even if Ur ¼ 0, the swept vanes imply a non-zero value for Uzc in the cascade reference frame, a case already treated by Glegg [33] and Hanson [4]. From the aerodynamic radial wavenumber kr introduced in Section 2.2, it is assumed that the wavenumber along zf veriﬁes the relation:
From the azimuthal periodicity of the conﬁguration, the aerodynamic wavenumber along θd can only be equal to an inﬁnite amount of countable values. In the context of rotor–stator tonal noise, the azimuthal indices of the excitation are related to
the rotational direction such as. From Section 2.1, yd and θd are in the opposite directions thus:
since yf and yd are identical. From the dispersion relation veriﬁed by the wave vector K of the aerodynamic excitation: where. denotes a scalar product, the wavenumber in the xf direction is:
Fig. 2 illustrates that sign keeps the same sign for any value of Ω thus ensuring the independence of kxf relatively to the rotational direction. Finally the wave vector of the excitation in the cascade reference frame Rc can be found with:
crucial parameter for the cascade response is the inter-vane phase angle linking the responses of two consecutive vanes upon an interaction with a gust. Following [4], it is:
with d and h related to the inter-vane distance g ¼ 2πrd=V, represented in Fig. 2, by:
it can be shown that the inter-vane phase angle only depends on the harmonic index as
From the global conﬁguration introduced in Section 2.1, the elementary problem, represented in Fig. 5 in Rc corresponds to an aerodynamic gust of wavenumbers convected with an inviscid ﬂow of uniform velocity Uxc impinging on the cascade. This rectilinear cascade is composed of inﬁnitely thin ﬂat plates with inﬁnite span in the direction. In order to ensure the slip boundary condition on the plate surface, an unsteady pressure loading is created in response to the gust interaction. The cascade response function of Posson et al. [34] based on the previous work by Glegg [33] uses the Wiener–Hopf technique on four sub-problems to resolve the vane loading, with the following boundary conditions: con- tinuity of velocity potential upstream of the leading edge, zero velocity normal to the plate (slip condition) and pressure continuity at the trailing edge (Kutta condition). A closed form expression for the acoustic ﬁeld and for the vane loading is obtained providing that the non-overlapping distance d (see Eq. (17)) is smaller than the plate chord. the vanes partially overlap over their whole span. The analytical expression of the elementary vane loading ΔP 0 is presented in Appendix A.
Moreover the resolution needs the non-overlapped length of the cascade d to be positive, that is the case of the con- ﬁguration with Ωo0 in Fig. 5(a). In other words, s being the cascade gap, the cascade response function is valid for χ 40, with:
However a simple symmetry consideration between both conﬁgurations of Fig. 5 leads to the following relation:
since the pressure and suction sides of a vane are inverted with respect to the yc direction as in Fig. 5(a) and (b). Eq. (19) allows the cascade response function to be used for any sign of the rotational velocity while jdjoC. It must be mentioned that the semi-numerical method employed for the resolution of the cascade response of Ventres et al. [35] makes possible any value of d. The implementation of this 2D model has allowed conﬁrming the validity of Eq. (19) for 2D gusts in [48]. It has also highlighted the limitation of this semi-numerical cascade response as its accuracy depends of the amount of discretisation points, especially at high frequencies, contrary to the closed-form expression for the cascade response pre- sented in Appendix A. The present analytical cascade response has been validated in a rectilinear conﬁguration in [34] by successful comparisons with alternative models, e.g. the LINSUB model [49], the semi-numerical LINC code [22] and the three-dimensional linearised Euler code of Ataasi et al. [8].
The 3D analytical cascade response is used with a correction proposed in [50] in order to account for annular effects in an otherwise rectilinear problem. Indeed this correction has been shown to strongly reduce unphysical effects related to the strip theory approach applied to a varying geometry along the duct height [48]. Previous studies have also evaluated the vane thickness effect as well as the ﬂuid viscosity effect on fan tonal noise generation and propagation [41]. Vane thickness has been found to modify the distribution of the acoustic energy across the radial modes within each azimuthal mode. Viscous effects are of secondary importance, providing neither vortex shedding nor any secondary ﬂow with their own frequency close to tonal frequencies exists. Besides vane camber has been shown to be relevant for fan tonal noise pre- diction, and a simple method for considering vane camber effects has been proposed [51]. It is based on the coupling of two cascade response functions with different stagger angles and is not applied for the present study.
From the pressure jump P x ; z ; σ; k created by the impingement of a gust on the cascade (Eq. (A.2)), the cascade response at the qth harmonic of the BPF is written as:
For the future integration on the vane, the pressure jump needs to be expressed on the chord at constant radius Cd, inclined of φ with the chord C in Rc. Assuming a small value for φ, the pressure jump is [50]:
with Cd ¼ C= cos φ. In Eq. (20), the summation over the indices p of the radial wavenumber is actually truncated. Indeed for a given pulsation of the incoming gust qB Ω, only a limited amount of diffracted cascade acoustic modes is cut-on and directly contributes to the cascade response [4]. In addition, because of the rectilinear to annular transformation in the acoustic analogy, some cut-off modes may also have an inﬂuence on the response, especially at low frequencies [48]. That is why the criterion on kzc deﬁning the truncation of Eq. (20) corresponds to an extension of the expression given in [4]. It reads:
with CΔkzc ¼ 20, and has been shown to be relevant for the present study.
The acoustic analogy is based on the unsteady loading on the whole vane surface, analytically predicted by the cascade response function (Eq. (21)), that is used as dipole sources. Assuming that the stator is placed in an inﬁnite annular duct with a constant section and rigid walls, containing a uniform axial mean ﬂow (Uxd ¼ c0Mxd), Goldstein [20] gives the for- mulation of the acoustic pressure perceived by an observer located at point x ¼ ðxd; rd; θdÞ inside the duct at time t generated by the force f exerted at point x0 ¼ ðx0; r0; θ0Þ and time t0 by the vane surface Sðx0Þ on the ﬂuid:
with T large but ﬁnite and the monopole and quadrupole terms being neglected. G is Green's function tailored to a rigid annular duct with a uniform axial mean ﬂow thus verifying the boundary conditions on the hub and tip walls. G can be
The radial eigenfunction Em;μ, corresponding to the radial component of the solution of the Helmholtz equation, is a linear combination of Bessel functions [20]. This function Em;μ must satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem, written for a rigid duct as:
The duct eigenvalues χm;μ are the constants of the Bessel functions allowing the boundary conditions of Eq. (26) to be satisﬁed. The indices m and μ are associated with the azimuthal and radial mode orders respectively. The axial acoustic wavenumber is γ 7, the superscripts þ and - indicating respectively the upstream and downstream propagations:
For both conﬁgurations in Fig. 5, n represents the unitary vector normal to the vane, directed from the pressure to the suction side, corresponding to n ¼ -sign. Using the matrix Q (Eq. (3)), the coordinates of n in the duct reference frame are:
The ﬂow being inviscid, the force f in Eq. (23) is only composed of its component normal to the vane, i.e. the pressure distribution, thus:
The integrand of Eq. (23) is then:
Using Green's function introduced in Eqs. (24) and (29) becomes:
Using Eq. (23) applied to tonal noise and dealing only with positive frequencies qBjΩj, the acoustic pressure within the duct for the harmonic q is expressed as:
The double inﬁnite sum in Eq. (31) is limited to the acoustic duct modes (m,μ) excited by the rotor–stator interaction that verify the following relation, adapted from Tyler and Sofrin [52], providing a regular equispaced set of rotor blades and stator vanes:
integral along the xc direction of the pressure distribution in Eq. (21):
and the acoustic wavenumber in the xcd direction is:
It can be veriﬁed that the modal pressure coefﬁcient in Eq. (33) keeps the same value for any rotational direction, noting that the sign of the azimuthal index m changes between both conﬁgurations of Fig. 2. Finally the acoustic power of the harmonic q reads after integration in a duct section [36]:
Among the excited duct modes (Eq. (32)), only the cut-on modes, i.e. verifying the relation κ2 40, are considered in the
coustic power calculation of Eq. (36).
Our model dedicated to the prediction of tonal fan noise has been fully described in this section. It has been shown that this model is a generalisation of the model of Posson et al. [34,39] for fan broadband noise prediction. As stated in the introduction, this model uses successive developments from Glegg [33] and Hanson [4]. Several original contributions have been introduced within the present model in order to increase the accuracy of the prediction. First an uniﬁed formulation of the whole set of equations has been proposed in order to account for both rotational directions of the fan. A radial decomposition for the aerodynamic excitation has also been introduced. It aims at accounting for the radial correlation existing between the excitation and the cascade response along the duct height in the tonal noise context. In order to consider a realistic ﬂow, this model is able to consider the radial component of the mean ﬂow velocity. Moreover the aerodynamic input data can be extracted, from experiments or numerical simulations, on a surface matching the radial shape of the vane leading edge. This ensures an accurate gust–cascade interaction modelling, especially for vanes with complex geometries.
The tonal fan noise prediction model detailed in Section 2 is evaluated on the Advanced Noise Control Fan (ANCF) conﬁguration. This test bed has been operated at the NASA Glenn Research Center [53,54] and has supported a large amount of aeroacoustic research directed towards fan noise prediction, control and reduction [55]. The ANCF test case has been chosen as it is representative of an actual fan stage of a modern high bypass ratio turbofan. Indeed the rotor–stator stage represented in Fig. 6 is mounted in a 1.219 m (4 feet) diameter annular duct with a hub to tip ratio of 0.375. At the fre- quencies of interest, this ensures the propagation of azimuthal and radial acoustic duct modes similarly to the acoustic ﬁeld present in a nacelle. As shown in Fig. 6, the large scale structures of the inlet ﬂow are reduced by an inﬂow control device so that no additional tonal noise comes from ingested vortical structures [53]. The particularity of this test rig corresponds to the center body supporting the rotor without any structural element ﬁxed to the outer casing. Thus the rotor alone and rotor–stator conﬁgurations can be investigated without any possible strut interactions in the inlet or exhaust part of the duct. This fan rig is placed in an anechoic test facility equipped with aerodynamic and acoustic measurement devices [56,57]. In particular two rotating rakes [58] allow capturing the modal content of the acoustic ﬁeld generated by the fan stage, in a cylindrical section at the inlet and in an annular section at the exhaust, with a hub to tip ratio of 0.5 (see Fig. 6). This system provides the modal decomposition of the acoustic power used in Section 3.4 for the comparisons with the analytical predictions.
The rotor is composed of 16 blades with a 0.133 m chord. The stator vane chord is C ¼ 0.114 m with an aspect ratio of C=ðRT - RH Þ ¼ 0.3. It is radially stacked with a 12° twist without any sweep nor lean angle. In this highly conﬁgurable fan stage, the stator vane count V can vary between 13 and 30 in keeping the same vane geometry. Thus the solidity changes from CV =2πRT ¼ 0.39–0.84 at the tip. Even with these relatively low solidities, the vane stagger angle close to 0° at the tip ensures that cascade effects are present since the overlapping length is 84 percent of chord with V ¼ 13. The inter-blade row spacing, measured at the hub, can vary between 1/2 and 2 vane chords from the rotor blade trailing edge. One of the stator vanes is instrumented with ﬂush-mounted microphones on each side of the vane [43], as schematically represented in Fig. 7. This allows capturing the unsteady vane loading, partly corresponding to the tonal acoustic sources, that are com- pared with analytical predictions in Section 3.3. At nominal conditions the rotational velocity is 1800 RPM, giving a blade passing frequency (BPF) of 480 Hz, a peripheral tip Mach number around 0.34 and an axial Mach number around 0.15. The mass ﬂow rate is 56 kg s-1 and the Reynolds number based on the blade chord is around 4 x 105.
Among the investigations performed in the ANCF test rig, a particular attention is paid to the work of Sutliff et al. [42,43]. Indeed these references contain the measured vane unsteady loading and modal acoustic powers of the tonal noise gen- erated by the rotor–stator interaction, for several conﬁgurations listed in Table 1. These allow performing trend studies with the stator vane count and the rotational speed. The cut-on and excited duct modes at 1 BPF and 2 BPF in these conﬁgurations are reported in Table 1. For all these cases, the inter-row spacing is ﬁxed at half a vane chord. Moreover Sutliff et al. [42] compare the modal powers with the predictions of V072 code, corresponding to the cascade based model of Ventres et al.
[35] updated by Meyer and Envia [36]. As already mentioned in the introduction and in Section 2.4, this model is close to the present evaluated model, the main differences being the semi-numerical resolution of the 2D cascade response instead of a closed-form expression of the 3D cascade response for the current model. Note that both models use the same acoustic analogy of Goldstein [20] in an annular duct for the acoustic propagation.
In Sections 3.4 and 3.4, the acoustic model introduced in Section 2 is evaluated on the ANCF conﬁgurations listed in Table 1 against experimental results and V072 analytical predictions. The aerodynamic input data needed for these pre- dictions are also provided in [42] and consist of crossed hot-wire measurements in the plane of the stator vane leading edges, the stator being removed. Thus the convection effects on the rotor wakes are correctly taken into account, but the inﬂuence of the upstream potential effect of the stator on these wakes is absent. This potential effect may signiﬁcantly modify the shape of the rotor wake, as studied by de Laborderie et al. [59] for instance. Therefore, the vortical excitation used in the models does not exactly correspond to the actual excitation impinging on the vanes. The X-shape of the probe, placed in a plane perpendicular to the radial direction, provides the axial and tangential velocity components. The experimental uncertainty is around 0.6 m/s on the velocities and 0.2° on the angles [42]. From these two-component hot-wire data, the upwash is determined as the velocity component normal to the mass-averaged absolute ﬂow angle [42]. In order to perform relevant comparisons, the upwash over one blade passage and the mean velocity proﬁles provided in [42] are used as input data for the acoustic predictions with the present cascade model. Although the velocity proﬁles are available for the four rotational speeds of Table 1, the upwash in the stator leading edge plane is only given at 1850 RPM. It is represented in Fig. 8, where the velocity deﬁcit, indicating the rotor wake, is decreasing with the increasing radius. According to Sutliff et al. [42], the upwash for the other rotational speeds are similar to Fig. 8. However it means that the excitations used for the V072 predictions are not identical to the single one used with the present model. It has to be mentioned that the mean ﬂow properties (temperature and density), not available in [42], are coming from a more recent measurement campaign [56]. The equivalent stagger angle χ of the ﬂat plate cascade used for the V072 predictions, cor-responding to a weighted average of the inlet and outlet vane metal angles, is given in the reference paper [42].
As described in Section 3.1, one of the ANCF stator vanes is instrumented with embedded microphones, shown in Fig. 7, in order to locally measure the unsteady vane loading. The latter is known to represent the sources of rotor–stator inter-action tonal noise, as mathematically expressed in Eqs. (31)–(36). The measurements correspond to the amplitudes (in terms of sound pressure levels (SPL)) and phases of the wall pressure on each side of a vane, for all the cases reported in Table 1. These data are provided in [43]. However, for the sake of brevity, only a single case is analysed in this section, corresponding to the stator with 14 vanes and Ω ¼ 1800 RPM. Indeed for this conﬁguration, the amount of microphones is larger than for the other cases since the sensors line at 85 percent of chord in Fig. 7 is only installed in this case. These experimental data allow evaluating the cascade response function of the acoustic model introduced in Section 2.4, in its 2D and 3D versions. To this end, the measured wall pressures are ﬁrst transformed into pressure jumps across the vane, knowing that the microphones are mounted by pair at the same chordwise and spanwise locations on each side of the vane. Unlike the acoustic power comparisons performed in Section 3.4, no analytical results from the V072 cascade response function are available preventing any comparisons between both acoustic models.
Fig. 9 represents the unsteady loading at 1 BPF along the vane chord at the three spanwise positions shown in Fig. 7, measured by the microphones and predicted by the 2D and 3D versions of the cascade response function. From the vane leading edge to around 60 percent of chord, the SPL shapes are in good agreement all over the span, with a higher loading level in the leading edge region followed by a smooth decrease. This is consistent with the vane interaction noise theory (e.g. [13]) predicting that the main acoustic sources are generated in the leading edge region of the proﬁle where the incoming gust is diffracted. In Fig. 9(a), the 2D response gives a prediction closer to the experimental data than the 3D response, whereas both produce equivalent results in Fig. 9(b) and (c). Nevertheless the measured pressure jumps present a sudden SPL rise starting at around 70 percent of chord in the upper part of the vane (at 0.74RT and 0.91RT). This behaviour is not predicted by the model for which the loading monotonically decreases until the trailing edge. Referring to the original data in [43], it is shown that this local SPL increase only occurs on the vane suction side. Indeed as mentioned in [42], the mean ﬂow incomes on the vane with a relatively high incidence thus creating a ﬂow separation on the downstream part of the vane suction side that is responsible for this high level of pressure ﬂuctuations at these locations. As the model assumes a zero incidence mean ﬂow, this ﬂow separation mechanism cannot be predicted analytically. The ﬂow separation is also responsible for the high level of phase ﬂuctuations observed in Figs. 9(e) and (f). In addition, the discrepancy between the measured and predicted loading phases (Figs. 9(d)–(f)) is partly caused by the stator potential effect not present in the upwash used for the predictions (see Section 3.2). This potential effect modiﬁes the phase of the excitation, as shown in [59], thus directly impacts the phase of the vane response.
Figs. 10(a) and (b) compare the loadings in the spanwise direction in the leading edge region (20 percent of chord). The levels match fairly well between the measurements and the predictions in terms of SPL. The phases are also in correct agreement, except for a constant shift existing between 0.5RT and the vane tip, again caused by the stator potential effect on the wake. The global shape of the measured phase, decreasing from hub to tip, indicates that the rotor wake interacts with the vane bottom part before the vane tip. At 85 percent of chord (Figs. 10(c) and (d)), the level of the predicted loading is 
well below the experimental data in the upper part of the vane, conﬁrming the previous observation related to the ﬂow separation on the vane suction side in the trailing edge region.
The vane loadings at 2 BPF are compared in Figs. 11 and 12. Similarly to the case at 1 BPF, the SPL values are higher in the leading edge region than in the rest of the chord, a behaviour correctly predicted by the model. The agreement between the experimental data and the 3D cascade response are very satisfactory at 0.74 and 0.91RT. The ﬂow separation is again visible in the SPL data in Figs. 11(b) and (c) from 70 percent of chord, but the level rises are less pronounced that at 1 BPF. The measured and analytical loading phases (Figs. 11(d)–(f)) are signiﬁcantly different, especially in the upper part of the vane where the large variation of the phases indicates a complex ﬂow behaviour not predicted by the model. Yet some of the phase shifts in the measurements are also questionable and suggest larger experimental uncertainties on the phase at this frequency. At 0.49RT (Fig. 11(a)), the 3D model under-predicts the loading by about 10 dB and the 2D model by a larger value. This is also visible in Fig. 12(a) representing the loading evolution in the spanwise direction. Sharp deﬁcit peaks appear in the analytical responses around 0.49RT and 0.83RT, whereas the measured and predicted vane loading compare fairly well on the rest of the vane height. Sudden phase changes are present at the same radial locations in Figs. 12(b) and (d). These analytical discontinuities originate from the coupling of the strip theory with a cascade response function, as already dis-cussed in [33,60] for instance. Indeed the variation of the rectilinear cascade geometry at each strip makes possible dif-fracted cascade acoustic modes and inter-vane channels modes to become cut-on at speciﬁc spanwise locations. Following a procedure similar to [48], it can be shown that the discontinuity at 0.49RT is caused by a cascade acoustic mode, generated by the interaction of the gust (q ¼ 2, kzc ¼ 0) with the cascade, becoming cut-on at this location. At 0.83RT, the inter-vane channel mode, created by a zero radial wavenumber gust, becomes cut-on at this position for 2 BPF and is responsible for the loading discontinuity. These two discontinuities, present over the whole chord, are also visible at 85 percent of chord in Fig. 12(c). Note that a cascade acoustic mode is also becoming cut-on near the vane tip in Fig. 10 explaining the differences between the 2D and 3D responses at this location. On the rest of the vane span, the predicted levels are lower than the experimental data, a feature again caused by the ﬂow separation taking place on a large part of the vane suction side. As previously noted, the experimental phase data present large uncertainties at this frequency limiting the comparisons in Figs. 12(b) and (d).
The comparisons performed in this section show that the differences between the 2D and the 3D cascade responses increase with the frequency of the excitation. Indeed, a single gust of zero radial wavenumber contributes to the 2D response, whereas the amount of skewed gusts contributing to the 3D response rises with the frequency. This 3D behaviour improves the modelling accuracy relatively to the actual interaction [48]. Moreover, the local discontinuities created by the coupling of the strip theory with a cascade response function are smaller with the 3D model than with the 2D model, leading to a more accurate prediction with the 3D model, e.g. in Figs. 11(a) and (c). Thus the analysis of the predicted unsteady vane loading with respect to wall pressure measurements allows reasonably validating the 3D cascade response function in an actual fan conﬁguration. The main discrepancies encountered in the comparisons have been explained, as they result from the measured upwash not accounting for the stator potential effect as well as a ﬂow separation region on the upper part of the vane suction side.
Using the measured aerodynamic data of Sutliff et al. [42], among which the upwash shown in Fig. 8, the cascade model detailed in Section 2 is applied to the whole set of conﬁgurations listed in Table 1. For a complete evaluation, both the 3D and the 2D version of the model, i.e. with the decomposition of Eq. (7), are considered. In this section, the sound power level (SWL) of Eq. (36) is presented for each harmonic of the BPF and for the upstream and downstream propagations. In Figs. 13– 16, these analytical predictions are compared with experimental power values obtained from the rotating rakes installed in the inlet and exhaust part of the duct (see Fig. 6) as well as with the predictions of the 2D cascade model V072 reported in [42].
In the stator conﬁguration with 13 vanes, only the duct mode (3,0) is excited and cut-on at 1 BPF (Table 1). For this case, Figs. 13(a) and (b) show an excellent agreement between the analytical predictions and the experimental values, for the upstream and downstream propagations respectively. Indeed the results of the model are within 2.4 dB from the measured values upstream. In Fig. 13(a) the 3D model predicts the power with a gap of 0.4 dB at 1800 RPM, the V072 value being at 0.7 dB. Downstream (Fig. 13(b)), the 3D model results vary between 1 and 1.8 dB with respect to the V072 predictions. For both upstream and downstream propagations, the experimental trend shows an increase of sound power with the rota-tional velocity, whereas all analytical predictions appear relatively ﬂat. The difference between upstream and downstream powers is more pronounced experimentally than with the predictions. At 2 BPF, the modes (- 7,0) and (6,0) propagate within the duct. The sum of their SWL is plotted upstream and downstream in Figs. 13(c) and (d) respectively. The present cascade model provides a relatively poor agreement with the V072 prediction, between 7 and 11 dB upstream and around 7 dB downstream. If the 3D model and V072 results present a similar trend with Ω, they both are far from the experimental trends. The latter show large and non-monotonic SWL variations with the rotor speed, that are partly explained in [42] as an acoustic reﬂection in the exhaust section where the rotating rake is mounted. It must also be mentioned that for all the comparisons performed in this section, the analytical results are obtained from an acoustic analogy in a constant section annular duct with RH=RT ¼ 0:375, whereas the measurements at the inlet and exhaust rotating rakes take place in sections with RH =RT ¼ 0 and 0.5 respectively. Thus reﬂections and standing waves may appear in the actual duct geometry thus explaining some differences with the analytical results.
In Figs. 14(a) and (b), corresponding to the stator with 14 vanes at 1 BPF, only the duct mode (2,0) is present. For both the upstream and downstream propagations, the 2D and 3D versions of the model are similar and very close to the V072 predictions (around 0.5 dB). The analytical results are in fair agreement with the experimental data upstream since the gap is about 2 dB, whereas this difference is larger downstream (between 7 and 8 dB). It is interesting to note that the predicted trend with Ω is now similar to the measured one. At 2 BPF, a single azimuthal mode is created, with two radial components (4,0) and (4,1). The upstream and downstream predictions given by the 3D model (triangles in Figs. 14(c) and (d)) are in correct agreement with the measured data since the differences are within 2 dB at 1700 and 1750 RPM and 3 dB at 1800 and 1850 RPM (except at 1850 RPM downstream where the experimental value shows an odd sharp drop). Therefore the 3D model provides better results upstream, and worse downstream, than the V072 code.
With the 26 vane stator, all the duct modes are cut-off at 1 BPF. Figs. 15(a) and (b) show the acoustic power at 2 BPF, corresponding to the single (6,0) mode. Again the evolution of the experimental data with the rotational speed is sig- niﬁcative, with an increase followed by a strong decrease of the levels upstream and by a slight decrease downstream. No acoustic model is able to predict this measured shape, partly inﬂuenced by the actual duct acoustic propagation as stated above. Moreover, according to [42], the main reason for this particular experimental trend was not deﬁnitely found, but could result from mode trapping and scattering. Only for this conﬁguration, it is remarkable to note that the 2D and 3D models clearly present opposite trends. Both provide results below the V072 predictions, between 7.5 and 0.5 dB upstream and around 5 dB downstream for the 3D model.
Again no duct mode is cut-on at 1 BPF in the 28 vane stator conﬁguration. At 2BPF, a single azimuthal mode with two radial components (4,0) and (4,1) propagates. For the upstream propagation (Fig. 16(a)), it is shown that the analytical predictions are similar since they are all comprised within 1 dB. They are very close to the measured power, at least for the available data. Downstream (Fig. 16(b)), the evaluated 3D model provides results closer to the experimental data than the other 2D models and under-predicts the measurements by 0.4–1.6 dB.
In summary the present comparisons of tonal acoustic powers have allowed the evaluation of the cascade model intro- duced in Section 2 relatively to measured data and analytical predictions of an existing code. As explained in Section 3.2, the V072 code and the 2D version of the model should be similar since they both use a 2D cascade response function coupled with an acoustic analogy within an annular duct. Figs. 14(a), (b) and Figs. 16(a), (b) indeed show very close results between these two codes. However in some cases, e.g. in Figs. 13(a), (b) and Figs. 14(c), (d), the 2D results present a similar trend but are separated by a shift. For the other cases, the 2D predictions are relatively different. From this analysis, it may be inferred that the input data used for V072 and the 2D models are not exactly equivalent, especially concerning the mean ﬂow values that are not provided in [42] and come from a more recent study [56]. Therefore, this shows that these acoustic models are particularly sensitive to the input data. As described in Section 2, the 3D cascade model has been designed to improve the fan noise prediction. In half of the studied cases, the 3D model provides better or equivalent (less than 1 dB difference) results than the V072 code relatively to the experimental data. Moreover, the cases where the 3D model gives worse than expected results correspond to the conﬁgurations for which the measured powers are highly inﬂuenced by a complex acoustic duct propa- gation not accounted for in the model (Figs. 13(c), (d) and Figs. 15(a), (b)). This phenomenon is related to the variations of the duct section [42]. Therefore, following the assessment of the 3D cascade response in Section 3.3, a reasonable validation of the 3D model is provided. It is shown to accurately predict tonal noise created by the rotor–stator interaction, in the limits of the assumptions that mainly consist of an acoustic propagation within a constant section annular duct and of the absence of the acoustic transmission and reﬂection through the fan. The inﬂuence of the stator potential effect on the rotor wake, seen in Section 3.3, must also be added to the sources of discrepancies with the measured acoustic powers. Moreover, except for one stator conﬁguration, the trend with the vane count and the rotational speed is predicted by the 3D model. It should also be emphasised that this is the ﬁrst detailed comparison of this analytical model for high-speed rotor–stator interaction noise with detailed source and noise measurements.
Following the validation of the tonal noise prediction model with an actual fan conﬁguration, an axial compressor stage setup is now chosen in order to illustrate the range of applications of this model. The CME2 low pressure research com- pressor (Laboratoire de Mecanique de Lille – Snecma Moteurs, France) is composed of a 30-blade rotor upstream of a 40-vane stator [44]. It is mounted in a convergent annular duct with a hub-to-tip ratio of RH=RT ¼ 0:77 at the leading edge of the stator vanes and an outer casing of 0.55 m constant diameter (Fig. 17). The vanes have a uniform aspect ratio of C=ðRT - RHÞ ¼ 1:25 and are stacked without any sweep nor lean angles. Their stagger angle varies from 17.5° at the hub to 12.5° at the tip. The solidity at midspan of the stator being CV =2πRT ¼ 2:01, cascade effects on the noise sources are expected to be signiﬁcant, thus justifying the use of the present acoustic model. The gap between the rotor and the stator varies from 17 percent at the hub to 29 percent of the vane chord at the tip. The rotational speed is 6300 RPM at nominal conditions, implying a BPF of 3150 Hz. At this operating point, the mass ﬂow rate is 11 kg s-1 and the total pressure ratio of the stage is 1.14. The compressor operates in a fully subsonic regime with a 0.33 axial Mach number at the inlet.
A detailed unsteady compressible ﬂow simulation of this conﬁguration has recently been performed and validated in [59] with available experimental data from [44]. The Navier–Stokes solver Turb'Flow, developed at Ecole Centrale de Lyon in France, was chosen for this simulation as it is speciﬁcally designed for turbomachinery applications. This solver is based on a ﬁnite volume formulation and solves the conservative equations on a multiblock structured grid [61]. This URANS wall- resolved simulation has been performed on one tenth of the compressor, the computational domain being composed of three rotor blades and four stator vanes. The ﬂowﬁeld is transferred from the rotating grid to the ﬁxed grid through an interface using a high-order Fourier decomposition and recomposition with adequate angular phase in the azimuthal direction. The conservative ﬂow variables are spatially discretised with the second-order Jameson centered scheme. Kok's k–ω turbulence model [62] is used along with a limiter for the production of turbulent kinetic energy. The time marching is performed with an explicit single-time-stepping method based on a second order Runge–Kutta scheme using up to ﬁve steps. As an illustration of the ﬂow topology, Fig. 18 presents an instantaneous axial Mach number ﬁeld at midpsan of the compressor. The boundary layers on both sides of the rotor blades merge at the trailing edges to form the wake. The latter are convected with the mean ﬂow and interact with the stator vanes.
This unsteady ﬂow simulation has two main purposes in this aeroacoustic context. On the one hand, it provides the aerodynamic excitation w for the model. As shown in [59], the upwash from a rotor–stator simulation has to be extracted as close as possible to the vane leading edge (around 1 percent of chord upstream of the vane) during a complete cycle, and averaged in the rotor reference frame, in order to account for the convection by the ﬂow and the stator blockage effects on the wake. This excitation is represented in Fig. 19 over a rotor blade passage. On the other hand, the unsteady wall pressure ﬂuctuations, partly corresponding to the tonal acoustic sources, can be recorded on every gridpoint of the vane surfaces. These data have been used in a CAA method developed in [48] that has allowed to perform preliminary assessments of the present acoustic model.
As stated in the introduction, the acoustic model is particularly suited to perform parametric studies on complex geo- metries, contrary to a CAA approach. Thus it perfectly meets the requirements of a pre-design tool in an industrial context. In order to demonstrate these features, a parametric study is performed on the CME2 compressor. From the original con- ﬁguration introduced in Section 4.1, the sweep and lean angles of the stator vanes are progressively modiﬁed. The inﬂuence of these geometrical variations can then be directly surveyed on the aerodynamic excitation, the acoustic sources and the acoustic power prediction.
The effect of swept stator vanes in rotor–stator tonal noise generation has been known from early studies, e.g. by Adamczyk [63] and Hayden et al. [64], since this geometrical modiﬁcation may lead to noise reduction with respect to radially stacked vanes. More recent works [33,65–67] give some physical insights into the mechanism related to this noise reduction. The rotor–stator interaction is highly dependent of the orientation of the rotor wakes with respect to the vanes leading edges. An increase of the rotor–stator spacing enhances the bending of the wakes by the mean ﬂow that is swirling within this gap. In order to obtain a similar wake–vane interactions for UHBR engines with short nacelles, that present a reduced fan-OGV spacing, swept and leaned stator vanes have to be introduced [66]. Sweeping the vanes in the backward direction, i.e. with φ^o0, reduces the mean ﬂow velocity component along the chord Uxc and extends the distance between the upstream rotor and the stator. Consequently the aerodynamic excitation is damped on the additional convection distance up to the vane leading edge, thus creating a lower vane response. Furthermore the main effect of sweeping stator vanes consists of large phase variations of the excitation along the vane leading edge direction. Therefore the vane submitted to this excitation also presents a signiﬁcant phase variation along the direction zc. This phase evolution from strips to strips leads to a lower inte- grated response on the vane compared to a radial vane because of possible cancellation of the source terms, thus to a reduction of the emitted tonal noise. Coupling sweep and lean angles of a vane can enhance the noise reduction efﬁciency.
Envia and Nallasamy [68] propose some guidelines for designing quieter stators: imposing backward sweep angles and lean angles in the rotational direction. These design rules were shown to be efﬁcient on an actual fan stage [69].
The ﬁrst surveyed parameter corresponds to the sweep angle of the CME2 stator vane. According to [68] and Fig. 3, φ^ has to be negative to obtain a tonal noise reduction with respect to the original stator geometry. Although the model is able to handle variable sweep angle along the duct height, it is chosen to keep this angle uniform in the present study for each case. The sweep angle varies between 0° and 30° with a 5° step, i.e. a typical range for modern compressors and fans [70]. The aerodynamic excitation, extracted in the original conﬁguration and represented in Fig. 19, has to be extrapolated until the leading edge plane of the swept stator for each case. This is performed using a linear extrapolation from the simulated ﬂowﬁeld in the inter-row gap, for each value of φ^. For instance, Fig. 20 represents the upwash velocity extrapolated until the leading edge plane of the stator swept with φ^ ¼ - 201. By comparisons with the upwash extracted on a radial plane in Fig. 19, it can be seen that the main sweep effects on the excitation consist of a decrease of the upwash amplitude, a more pronounced bending of the wake and a larger wake width. These effects are more signiﬁcant going from hub to tip since the leading edge plane is located at Δx ¼ ðrd - RHÞ tan jφ^ j in the axial direction from the radial plane. This additional distance is signiﬁcant since it corresponds to Δx 0:3 C at the tip for φ^ 201. It is particularly interesting to note the variation of the rotor wake shape with the orientation of the stator leading edge plane since this directly inﬂuences the wake–stator interaction as shown later. The bending of the wake seen by the swept vane tends to increase the amount of wake inter- sections per vane. This design objective has to be followed to ensure noise reduction according to [68].
For a quantitative analysis of the upwash evolution with the sweep angle, Fig. 21 presents the Fourier coefﬁcients (Eq. (8)) of the excitation for 1 and 2 BPF along the dimensionless coordinate. Concerning the amplitudes of these coefﬁcients, Figs. 21(a) and (c) clearly show the expected decrease of the excitation with the increase of the sweep angle (in absolute value). In this conﬁguration, it is observed that the decrease of the amplitudes is quasi-linear with the variation of φ^. This decrease is signiﬁcant since the amplitudes are globally divided by a factor of two for a 15° variation of the sweep angle. Figs. 21(b) and (d) show the phase of these coefﬁcients along z*c. As expected, the phase variations are increasing when going from φ^ ¼ 01 to φ^ ¼ -301. Again this feature is more signiﬁcant in the upper part of the duct than in the lower part.
Following the sweep effects on the aerodynamic excitation, the cascade response of the model (Section 2.4) is surveyed relatively to variations of φ^. Fig. 22 presents the cascade response along z*c, at 15 percent of chord from the leading edge, in terms of amplitudes. For 1 BPF, the behaviour of the response is similar to the one of the upwash, i.e. a quasi-linear decrease in amplitude with the increase of jφ^ j. The model is thus able to provide quantitative trends of the cascade response with the parametric variation of the sweep angle. For 2 BPF, increasing jφ^ j also leads to a decrease of the cascade response amplitude, nevertheless following a different pattern. Indeed, for the original vane (φ^ ¼ 01), the cascade response exhibits a sharp pressure peak at z*c ¼ 0:87. As already encountered in Section 3.3, this feature is caused by an inter-vane channel mode becoming cut-on at this location, upon the impingement of the gust with jpj ¼ 1 [48]. This phenomenon is directly linked to the local geometry of the equivalent rectilinear cascade and to the value of the incident velocity Uxc. By varying φ^, both the geometry and the mean ﬂow are changed. Therefore the cut-off frequencies of inter-vane channel modes are different for each sweep angle value. In Fig. 22(b), the pressure peak is indeed shifted towards the duct mid-height from φ^ ¼ 01 to, indicating that the corresponding inter-vane channel mode becomes cut-on at lower radii when increasing φ^.
This feature is coupled to a global decrease of the cascade response with the variation of the sweep angle, thus leading to the oscillatory shapes of the model response observed in Fig. 22(b).
Fig. 23 represents the phase of the cascade response over the vane surface for speciﬁc values of the sweep angle at 1 and 2 BPF. For the original vane geometry, the phase of the loading is quite radially uniform at 1 BPF, and already presents some radial variations at 2 BPF. For these two harmonics, the phase variations signiﬁcantly increase in the z* direction for larger values of φ^. This feature is caused by the phase variations of the excitation highlighted in Figs. 21(b) ancd (d). As a result, the cascade response is progressively decorrelated in the radial direction. This is known to be the main effect expected with swept stator vanes that leads to possible cancellations when the response is integrated over the vane [68].
The parametric study on the vane sweep angle is ﬁnally performed in terms of radiated sound power level (SWL) within the duct. Fig. 24 shows the values predicted by the model for each harmonic of the BPF previously investigated in terms of excitation and cascade response. The excited and radiated acoustic duct modes have been summed for each harmonic. As expected from the previous analysis, the predicted acoustic power globally decreases with an increase of jφ^ j. Indeed, the combined effects of reducing the amplitude of the upwash and decorrelating the excitation lead to lower values of the emitted sound power. This study emphasises the efﬁciency of swept vanes to provide a tonal noise reduction, since a value of 5 dB reduction can be expected on the acoustic power at 1 BPF for a 10° increase of the sweep angle. As shown in Fig. 24 (b), the slope is higher at 2 BPF for which a reduction of 10 dB can be found with a 10° increase of jφ^ j. The efﬁciency of acoustic power reduction thus increases with the tone harmonics. Overall the predicted evolution of acoustic power with the vane sweep angle, as well as the amount of sound reduction obtained, are in good agreement with reported results from tests or models [65,68,70]. The sweep angle variation similarly affects the upstream and the downstream radiations, as shown by the slopes in Figs. 24(a) and (b). However a non-monotonic behaviour of the acoustic power is found for high values of jφ^ j, as already encountered in [68] for instance. For 1 BPF, the acoustic power radiated downstream monotonically varies with the sweep angle, whereas this evolution is non-monotonic upstream. Thus the upstream propagation is more sensitive to the axial location of the sources than the downstream propagation, a feature already mentioned in [65]. Note that this parametric study has been performed in using an extrapolation to deﬁne a realistic rotor wake in function of the sweep angle. Within the limits of the error associated with this extrapolation, imposing the constraints of minimising the sound emission for each tone in each direction would lead to the optimal design of a stator composed of vanes with a 20° sweep angle.
Following the above parametric study on vane sweep angle only, the objective now consists of coupling lean and sweep angles. Indeed a proper combination of these design parameters may lead to an even more acoustically efﬁcient rotor–stator stage. According to Envia and Nallasamy [68], the lean angle ψ^ must be oriented in the rotational direction to provide a noise reduction, i.e. with a negative value here (see Fig. 4). Indeed with this conﬁguration, the amount of wake intersections per vane is increased. Due to this negative lean, the vane leading edge will see the rotor wake with a time delay. In other words, a phase shift is introduced in the upwash excitation to account for this delay, such as the upwash w extracted over an inclined plane becomes:
where rdψ^ represents the tangential distance at radius rd caused by the lean angle with respect to a straight vane [68].
Therefore the phase variation of the excitation is enhanced, and so should be the phase of the vane response. It can be thus expected to obtain lower values for the integrated vane loadings due to cancellations of the response caused by this highly varying phase response. In order to evaluate this effect on the CME2 compressor conﬁguration, the lean angle of the vanes varies between 0° and - 20°, for each of the swept stator conﬁguration already surveyed. For the sake of brevity, the upstream and downstream radiated acoustic powers are directly presented in Fig. 25.
Fig. 25 shows that, for each value of the lean angle, the evolution of the sound power with the sweep angle corresponds to a global decrease. For each case, the slopes of the curves are similar between each other and do not seem to depend on a speciﬁc lean value. At 2 BPF, Figs. 25(c) and (d) clearly show the expected inﬂuence of the lean angle. Indeed, for most of the sweep angle values, an increase of jψ^ j leads to a tonal noise reduction. This reduction is not linear, contrary to the sweep effect, and is of the order of 7 dB at 2BPF, for a 0–20° lean variation. Leaned vane alone is thus not a noise reduction mechanism as efﬁcient as swept vane, but the combination of both can lead to drastic reductions, e.g. 25–30 dB at 2 BPF, conﬁrming the results of previous studies [68]. A different trend is observed for the power predictions at 1 BPF in Figs. 25 (a) and (b). At this frequency, increasing the value of the lean angle does not necessarily lead to a power reduction, and may even increase the level of the acoustic emission. It means that the phase shifts brought by the swept and leaned geometry do not lead to the expected cancellations in terms of integrated vane loading, but rather to an increase of the sources. Indeed, similarly to sweep effect, the lean effect efﬁciency increases with the tone harmonics [68]. Therefore Figs. 25(a) and (a) show that the blade passing frequency of 3150 Hz seems too low for a positive power reduction in this conﬁguration. The efﬁcient stator design found in the sweep study, i.e. with φ^ ¼ -201, again appears to represent the optimal value for φ^ with variable lean angles. Indeed the conﬁguration with φ^ ¼ -201 and ψ^ ¼ -201 corresponds to the most efﬁcient design among the tested cases. At 1 BPF, this results in an almost equivalent design with respect to the swept stator only, with a slight increase of 2 dB upstream and an interesting reduction of 4 dB downstream. It is thus shown that, on this compressor, a parametric study focused on vane sweep only is able to provide the optimal value for φ^ of a combined swept and leaned vane design. Moreover the surveyed noise reduction mechanism highly depends on the harmonic since its efﬁciency increases with the frequency. Finally a clear trend in terms of noise reduction is found with the sweep angle whereas this trend appears more complex with the lean angle.
In this paper, a detailed description of an analytical model for tonal fan noise prediction has been performed. The physical mechanism of interest consists of the tonal noise generated by the rotor–stator interaction. Indeed it corresponds to one of the main noise contributions in current turbofan engines and its inﬂuence is expected to grow in future Ultra-High Bypass Ratio turbofan engines. The presented model has been designed to precisely account for complex stator vanes geometries, with variable stagger, sweep and lean angles along the duct height, as tonal noise is sensitive to these para- meters. A procedure has been proposed to use the rotor wake as the input excitation for the model. Namely, it is ﬁrst recommended to extract the upwash, from measurements or ﬂow simulations, in a surface matching the radial evolution of the vane leading edges, and second to decompose this excitation into three-dimensional skewed gusts. The acoustic sources are provided by a cascade response function used within a radial strip theory, so that the radial correlation characteristics of both the excitation and the response, typical for tonal noise, are considered. Moreover cascade effects occurring on noise generation and propagation for blade rows with overlapping elements are fully accounted for. Finally the sources are used as acoustic dipoles in an acoustic analogy tailored to an annular duct containing a uniform mean ﬂow. This ensures the radiated acoustic energy to be distributed on the actual cut-on and excited duct modes. In view of existing cascade models, the present model has been generalised to account for both rotational directions.
The proposed model has then been validated on an actual fan stage conﬁguration. It should be mentioned that this is the ﬁrst detailed comparison of this model with noise sources and far-ﬁeld measurements. The Advanced Noise Control Fan (ANCF), extensively tested at the NASA Glenn research center, is particularly suited for these comparisons. Indeed it is a low hub-to-tip ratio fan-OGV stage, with instrumented vanes (microphones) and duct (rotating rakes), installed in an anechoic environment. The data are available for several stator vane counts and several rotational velocities. Using an experimental dataset for the rotor wake, the cascade response of the model has ﬁrst been compared with unsteady pressure measure- ments on the instrumented vane surface. It has been found that the 3D version of the model provides a more accurate cascade response than the 2D model. These comparisons have led to a reasonable validation of the 3D response function, noting that two sources of discrepancies have been explained. On the one hand, a ﬂow separation in the upper part of the vane suction side enhances wall pressure ﬂuctuations, that cannot be predicted by the inviscid ﬂow model. On the other hand, the measured rotor wake used by the model does not account for the stator potential effect, whereas it inﬂuences the experimental vane response. The measured acoustic duct modes in the inlet and exhaust sections of the duct have then been compared with the results of the model in terms of acoustic power. Parametric studies with rotational velocities and vane counts have been performed, as well as comparisons with results from the V072 cascade model. In half of the studied cases, the proposed model has been shown to predict the radiated acoustic power with equivalent or more accuracy than the V072 model. For some other cases, the measurements have been highly inﬂuenced by a complex acoustic propagation within the duct, not accounted for in any of the models. The capability of the model to predict trends with vane counts and rotational velocities has been demonstrated on this conﬁguration.
This fan noise prediction model has been developed for research and industrial purposes. The model is thus expected to be included in an optimisation procedure aiming at designing quieter fan stages or more efﬁcient acoustic treatments. Thus it has to cope with parametric studies focused on the stator geometry. This feature has been demonstrated on the CME2 compressor stage. The excitation and mean ﬂow properties have been extracted from an existing detailed unsteady simulation of this rotor–stator conﬁguration to be input within the model. The parametric study has ﬁrst focused on the sweep angle of the vanes as results from the literature show this is an efﬁcient tonal noise reduction mean. Indeed swept vanes induce radial phase shifts in the excitation thus in the vane response, leading to lower integrated vane loadings. The model has correctly reproduced this behaviour, showing the expected trend in terms of vane loading evolution with the sweep angle (amplitude and phase). The model has also allowed predicting the acoustic power emitted by the stage in function of the vane sweep angle. An optimal design has been found with a - 20° sweep angle, yielding to a 10 dB reduction at 1 BPF and more than 15 dB reduction at 2 BPF with respect to a radially stacked stator. These values are within the range of what can be expected with this design. A two-parameter study has ﬁnally been performed concerning the vane sweep and lean angles. A proper orientation of the latter is indeed expected to enhance the noise reduction provided by the swept stator alone. This behaviour has been correctly reproduced by the model, showing that this noise reduction mechanism is highly dependent on the tone harmonics. A stator composed of vanes with a -20° sweep angle and a - 20° lean angle has been determined as the optimal acoustic design, bringing approximately an additional reduction of 7 dB with respect to the optimal swept design at 2 BPF.
Finally the proposed fan tonal noise model has been validated against experimental data and its pre-design tool char- acteristics have been demonstrated. Future research aiming at improving the accuracy of the prediction will mainly focus on the acoustic analogy used to radiate the acoustic sources.
The authors wish to acknowledge Dr. Daniel L. Sutliff, from NASA Glenn Research Center, for having provided us with the geometry and the tests data of the Advanced Noise Control Fan (ANCF), and for his fruitful discussions, that have allowed to evaluate the fan tonal noise prediction model on a representative fan test case.
The result of the analytical derivation of the vane loading ΔP 0 xc, corresponding to the source term used in the tonal noise model presented in this paper, is recalled here. From the velocity potential scattered outside of the vane cascade, provided by Glegg [33], in response to the impinging gust:
Posson et al. [34] extended this work to the calculation of the potential inside the inter-vane channels as well as to the pressure jump across the vanes. For a proper use of the Wiener–Hopf resolution method [34], the cascade must be split into the three segments I, II (or II0 ) and III, represented in Fig. A1. Segment II is considered when d o C=2 (Fig. A1(a)) and segment II0 when d 4 C=2 (Fig. A1(b)). Segments I and III represent diffraction problems at the leading edge and at the trailing edge respectively, linking the inter-blade channels mode existing in II (or II0 ) with the radiated cascade modes (these modes are discussed in Section 3.3). The vane loading ΔPb0ðxcÞ reads, according to the considered segment:
All the new terms appearing in the expressions of the vane pressure jumps are deﬁned below. ρ0 is the mean ﬂow density. The variables introduced by Glegg [33] are:
It must be mentioned that the wavenumbers of the excitation and of the cascade response in the zc direction are the same (kzc ¼ k0zc) since the rectilinear ﬂat plate cascade has an inﬁnite span (Section 2.4). The function J þ and J - are deﬁned as:
The Fourier transform of the velocity potential across a vane is decomposed into the four terms:
Air-Blast Cross-Flow Atomization of Cold Fluids
Abstract 
The motivation for 
this work is to gain a better understanding of how particle characteristic can be controlled when metallurgi-cal slags are atomized in cross-flow air atomization. The effect of certain process parameters on the characteristics of liquid droplets produced by air-blast atomization has been investigated using water, castor oil, and glycerin. The gas-to-liquid ratio as well as the distance between the liquid and air stream were manipulated to understand their effect on the particle shape and size. The effect of liquid viscosity on the size and shape of droplets was also investigated. Droplets were observed in-flight with the use of shadow imaging, which were analyzed to provide information regarding the mentioned characteristics. It was found that a single correlation expressed as kinetic energy of the atomizing air per unit mass of the atomized liquid can explain the effects of gas/liquid ratio and distance between the air nozzle and crash point. The average particle size decreased with an increase in the gas-to-liquid flow rate ratio, increased with increasing distance between the liquid and air stream, and increased with increasing viscosity. The aspect ratio was consistent and close to unity for all water atomization experiments.

Introduction 
Slag has traditionally been regarded as a waste byproduct from smelting operations and presents notable environmen-tal, operational, and financial significance for the metallur-gical industry. Typical slag generation rates range from 0.3 tonnes of slag per tonne of metal for blast furnace ironmak-ing to 14 tonnes of slag per tonne of metal for ferronickel production [1]. Global annual slag production is estimated at 680 million tonnes, with ferrous slags accounting for more than 90% of annual slag production at 610 million tonnes. 
Conventional slag handling operations include air cooling, wet, and dry granulation. Air cooling begins with the slag being dumped into a large open area and left to cool, where in some cases it is subsequently sent to downstream crushers for further processing. Operational challenges associated with air cooling include potential emission of toxic fumes and/or possibilities of dust gen-eration [2]. Excavation from the pit can be facilitated by water spraying, which causes the slag to crystallize and crack; this requires specific safety precautions be taken to mitigate the increased risk of explosions. 
Water granulation is carried out when molten slag is broken apart and quenched with a high-pressure water stream. The process has operational and environmental shortfalls, the most significant being the risk of steam explosions, the need for dewatering, and the energy costs associated with pumping and cooling large amounts of water [3]; water consumption can exceed ten times the mass of slag being atomized. The technology is also unat-tractive in certain areas due to water scarcity. 
Dry granulation is the process of producing granules in the absence of water. Common methods of dry granulation include centrifugal granulation and air granulation. Cen-trifugal granulation utilizes a high-speed rotating cup or disk. Molten slag is poured into the center of the container, spreading on the surface forming a thin film that eventu-ally breaks into slag granules. The process has been used and studied extensively; however, it has been shown to have a low production rate, high equipment and processing costs, and produces large particles [4]. The metallurgi-cal industry has therefore been seeking alternative slag handling methods in the past five decades that address the challenges of conventional slag handling operations, namely, the ability to produce valuable slag products and the ability to recover energy from slag [5]. Air granulation has been studied since the 1980s and has demonstrated success in the production of high value slag products [6]. 
Air granulation, also referred to as air-blast atomiza-tion, utilizes high-velocity air to break apart and quench a stream of molten material. The process is a subset of air atomization which has been adapted for high-viscosity melts; an industrial setup installed by Hatch Ltd. is shown in Fig..1. The process is capable of producing particles ranging from 0.5 to 5.mm [3]. The differences between air granulation and air atomization predominantly come from the geometry, relative placement, and positions of the melt and gas streams, as shown in Fig..2. Air-blast granulation is attracting attention for treatment of different types of slag due to the fact that it is more environmentally friendly, and having lower footprint and processing costs. 
It is proposed that production of powders through air atomization occurs in three distinct stages: wave growth, ligament formation, and finally the development of drop-lets [4]. As expected, the melt properties and operating parameters affect the final shape and size of the particles. Material properties include viscosity, density, and surface tension; operating conditions include gas to melt mass flow rate ratio, the degree of superheating, distance between the liquid and air stream, nozzle geometry, thickness of the liquid stream, and angle of impact between liquid and air. 
The motivation for this research is to correlate shape and size of the particles to these parameters for various types of fluids and operating conditions. Cold fluid modeling with different single-phase liquids is a useful primary tool in establishing the basic correlations of air granulation. This paper presents the experimental results of the effect of the air-to-liquid ratio, the distance between the liquid and air stream, and the liquid viscosity on the shape and size of particles produced from the granulation of water, castor oil, and glycerin, which offer a range of material properties that encompass the viscosity and density of industrial slag. This research is part of an ongoing study whose goal is to fill the knowledge gap related to cross-flow air slag granulation and gain a better understanding of how the characteristics of slag granules can be controlled. 
For a fixed nozzle and atomization system configuration, the dominant factor controlling particle size in air atom-ization is the gas-to-liquid (G/L) flow rate ratio [7]. The dynamic viscosity of the liquid being atomized also influ-ences the final size of the particles. A study by Goudar et.al. has shown that viscosity is the dominant material property influencing particle size [7]. The easiest way of altering the melt viscosity is by increasing its superheat, as shown by Small et.al. [8]. 

Experimental Procedure 
Design of.Atomization Chamber 
The experimental setup used in the present study is shown in Fig..3. The air nozzle measured 10.cm × 0.5.cm and was located below the stainless-steel container. The liq-uid stream was produced by allowing liquid to flow at room temperature under gravity through stainless-steel 
1 3 
containers which produced a flowing liquid sheet with a width of either 4 or 8.cm. The air exiting the nozzle impacted the liquid sheet wherein the fluid was broken apart and dispersed as liquid particles into the granulation chamber. Liquid droplets were collected inside the cham-ber and drained. The granulation process was observed and photographed from the side using shadow imaging. A combination of a high-speed camera and a strobe light was used to freeze the motion of the particles for imaging and subsequent droplet shape and size analysis. 

Liquid Stream Properties 
Liquid flow rates were computed using the respective den-sities and measuring the time it took to fill a 2-L beaker. The liquid flow rates and viscosities of the single-phase liquids used in the present study are shown in Table.1. 

Air Stream Properties 
The axial gas velocity at the exit of the nozzle was meas-ured using an anemometer probe. Knowing the dimensions of the nozzle allows for the computation of the gaseous mass flow rate, which are shown in Table.1. 

Distance Between Air Stream and.Liquid Stream 
The length of the air stream represents the distance between the air nozzle and the point where granulation occurs. The setup, resulting in an air stream length of 35 cm, is shown in Fig. 4. The different lengths investi-gated in the present study are shown in Table.1. 

Characterization of.Atomized Liquids 
Air atomization typically produces wide particle size distri-butions. The particle size distribution was characterized by identifying the mean particle diameter (d50, i.e., the diameter at which 50% of a samples mass is comprised of smaller particles) and the Sauter mean diameter (d32, i.e., the diam-eter whose ratio of volume to surface area is the same as 
Fig. 5 Time required to achieve constant mean particle size values during the granulation of cold fluids 
that of the entire droplet sample). For the purpose of these calculations, particles were assumed to be perfect spheres. The actual shape of particles is characterized by identifying the aspect ratio. 
Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software [9], which was used to examine the shape and size of par-ticles produced. The scale was set by using a piece of cop-per wire of known dimension (1.02.mm), giving a scale of 69 pixels/mm. Each experiment was repeated a mini-mum of two times and ran for a minimum duration of 15.s, which was identified as the time required to reach consist-ent d50 values, as shown in Fig..5. The maximum relative difference between the particle sizes in repeated experi-ments was observed to be 7%. An example of images used for further analyses is shown in Fig..6a. When performing the image analysis, special care was taken to remove any particles that were not in focus. An example of the same image post-processing is shown in Fig..6b. 


Results and.Discussion 
Theoretical Treatment 
Atomization occurs as a result of the kinetic energy trans-fer between the gas and liquid stream. The kinetic energy is dissipated to overcome the viscous forces that resist deformation and to overcome the surface energy forces that resist the formation of new surfaces. The ratio of energy required to overcome viscous and surface tension forces, can be expressed in terms of liquid phase Weber and Reynolds numbers, Eq.(1).
 As the gas continues to travel after atomization, at a reduced velocity and pressure, and also the fact that gas jet is wider than the liquid sheet, it is reasonable to assume that only a certain fraction of the gas kinetic energy at the interaction point is used to overcome the surface energy forces. This fraction is denoted with the variable β in the kinetic power equation, Eq.(2). 
This energy is fully consumed for break-up of the stream to a certain number of droplets. The surface energy of this particle cloud per unit time can be presented as Eq.(3). 
For a given mass flow rate of liquid, Eq.(3) can be rewrit-ten as Eq.(4). 
To satisfy the surface energy requirements for the production of new particles, the kinetic power has to be equal to that of the surface energy created in unit time, Eq.(5). 
A schematic of the expansion of the air sheet over the length of the air stream (L) is shown in Fig. 7. The area at the point of atomization is related to the original area by Eq.(6). It should be noted that the thickness of the air sheet is assumed to be much smaller than its width and it is also assumed that there is no pressure change over the short distance. The constant K′ is a relationship between the angle of expansion and the original thickness of the air sheet, as shown in Eq.(7). The average particle size in terms of initial operating conditions and material proper-ties is shown in Eq.(8). 

Experimental Results 
Table.1 shows the details of the experiments conducted during this study. In total, 15 different experiments were conducted at room temperature to investigate to effect of the gas-to-liquid ratio, distance between the air nozzle and crash point and the viscosity on the particle size. The mean and the Sauter mean diameter for each experiment are given in Table 1. 

Effect of.G/L Ratio on.Particle d32 and.Aspect Ratio 
Figure.8 shows the particles size distribution of water. The mass fraction graph indicates that the majority of particles present are between 400.μm and 800.μm. Small sizes < 150 μm as well as large sizes greater than 850.μm show lower mass fractions relative to other ranges. The double-hump distribution was consistent with all the other water modeling experiments conducted in this study. This is believed to be a result of two atomization modes, the pri-mary one with wave propagation and stream break-up and a secondary mechanism in which larger drops are broken into finer drops through an attrition-like mechanism [10, 11]. Only a portion of particles will undergo secondary atomiza-tion, causing the double-hump distribution. 
Typically, the droplet size is presented versus mass flow rate ratio of gas to liquid (G/L), as shown in Fig..9. It can be observed from the results that an increase in G/L flow rate ratio results in a decrease in the particle size. Atomization occurs as a result of kinetic energy transfer from the atom-izing medium to the liquid, larger G/L ratios have a greater kinetic energy available for sheet disintegration, resulting in smaller overall particles [12]. 
According to Eq..(8), when the pressure of the air stream is relatively constant, the particle size should follow a linear 
oo
relationship with m 3 ∕m . Figure.10 tests the correlation, 
gl 
showing that a linear trend is indeed followed. 
Figure.11 shows the influence of the gas-to-liquid flow rate ratio on the particle aspect ratio. The aspect ratio describes the relationship between the width and the height of a droplet. The particle aspect ratio is dependent on the difference between the solidification time and the spheroidi-zation time. In the present study, single-phase liquids do not undergo any solidification when atomized resulting in the droplets having ample time to spheroidize. The expected outcome was for low-viscosity liquids to spheroidize very rapidly, while liquids with a higher viscosity taking longer to spheroidize. Increasing the gas flow rate shortens the time required for droplets to spheroidize by generating smaller droplets, as shown in Fig..11. It is important to note that for high-viscosity liquids the positioning of the camera is very important and will affect the recorded aspect ratio, it is expected that after sufficient flight time the particles will spheroidize completely. 

Effect of.Distance Between Nozzle and.Liquid Stream 
Figure.12 shows the effect of the distance between air nozzle and the disintegration point. As shown, increasing the length of the air stream results in an increase in the particle size. This increase in particle size can be attributed to the loss of disintegration energy as the air has to travel a longer dis-tance to reach the liquid stream, and also the reduction of air velocity due to expansion while traveling towards the liquid stream. This can be confirmed by looking at Eq.(2), where a reduction of velocity would lead to less energy being avail-able for granulation. As the length continues to increase, the mean particle size will increase rapidly until atomization eventually stops as the minimum kinetic energy require-ments would not be met to cause any sheet disintegration. 
In the present study, the particle size was related to the length of the air stream (L), by fitting the geometric parameter K′, this was then used to calculate the particle size. Figure.13 compares the calculated and measured d32 values with change in length of the air stream. The calcu-lated d32 values are obtained by optimizing the thickness From the value of K′, the expansion angle of the air jet was calculated to be 0.2o. This implies very small expansion of the air stream, which is expected as the longest distance examined was 35.cm and the outlet air velocity was very high. It was also evident during the experiments that the disintegration takes place at approximately the same posi-tion of the falling liquid stream, showing little expansion of the air jet. 

Effect of.Fluid Properties 
Figure 14 shows the viscosity versus the particle size for liquids with different viscosities at constant G/L flow rate ratios. Although the number of data points is not large enough to draw a quantitative correlation, it can be seen that as the viscosity increases the average particle size also increases, in what appears to be a linear relationship. This agrees with the works of Goudar et.al. and Mandato et.al. [7, 13]. The Sauter mean diameter for glycerin, castor oil, and water are 1280, 1200, and 510.μm, respectively. An increase in viscosity hinders disintegration leading to larger energy requirements to achieve granulation, hence the reduced particle size. This may be mathematically explained using Eq..(1) where the ratio of viscous to surface tension energies increases linearly with the liquid viscosity. The implication is that the fraction of energy consumed for disintegration which is β in Eq..(8), decreases with viscosity. This is con-sistent with the observed trend in Fig..14, and subject of an ongoing study to include the effects of both viscous and surface energies into a unified correlation that would quan-titatively explain the results of all experimental conditions. 
Figure.15 shows the particle size distribution for glycerin; a similar distribution was observed for castor oil in Fig..16. It can be seen that as the viscosity increases, the mass frac-tion tends towards a single-hump distribution, compared to the double-hump distribution for water (Fig..8). This can be attributed to higher-viscosity liquids resisting secondary drop deformation. It is known that high-viscosity liquids exhibit a greater resistance to secondary atomization [11, 14]. The tendency is quantified using Ohnesorge number which presents the viscous forces to the inertial and surface tension forces and linearly proportional to the viscosity. 
1. Particle size can be controlled by manipulating the G/L flow rate ratio, the length of air streams, and the viscos-ity of liquids. 

2. Larger gas flow rate ratios produce smaller particles due to greater energy available per unit area for sheet disin-tegration. The particle size was related to the mass flow rate ratio of gas and liquid as mg3/ml mass. 

3. An increase in liquid viscosity produces a larger average particle size. 

4. An increase in the distance between the air nozzle and the disintegration point produces a larger average parti-cle size. 

5. Integration of viscous and surface energies involved in liquid atomization appears to be capable of producing a quantitative correlation for prediction of particle size as function of liquid properties and operating conditions. 





















Combined effervescent and airblast atomization of a liquid jet
Effervescent atomization shows great promise towards the production of small droplet sizes, but it can suffer from substantial instabilities. Adding a coaxial shear .ow to a central two-phase bubbly .ow is a simple extension of effervescent atomization, however, the characteristics of a combined air-blasting shear .ow and effervescent mode of fragmentation have not been well described in the literature. By making use of LDA/PDA measurements, high speed microscopic imaging of the atomization zone, and advanced image processing techniques, quantities such as the axial velocity .uctuations, pulsation frequencies, ligament sizes and liquid area fractions are measured and analysed with respect to the relative mass of effervescent air and air-blast air. The work shows that the coaxial air blast .ow does not change the frequency of the effervescent core pulsations but can act to dampen .uctuations whilst simultaneously improving dispersion characteristics. For this hybrid atomization mechanism, the measured axial velocity .uctuations are now a combined result of the instability of the effervescent spray core as well as mixing from the surrounding air .ow. Analysis suggests that frequencies associated with the effervescent atomization process can occur on similar scales as the surrounding mixing frequencies. Furthermore, sinusoidal instabilities from the coaxial air .ow are seen as superimposed onto the effervescent core indicating that a complex coupling can occur between the two modes of atomization.  2016 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction 
Pressure as well as air assisted atomization techniques are rel-evant to a wide variety of industrial problems, perhaps the most common one being in the combustion of liquid fuels. Airblast atomization, where a coaxially .owing air stream atomizes a cen-tral liquid jet, is widely investigated, with a large volume of litera-ture having examined the in.uence of key dimensionless groups on the atomization process [1–8]. It is now widely accepted that the overall Weber number of the .ow, the mass .ux of liquid with respect to the air .ow as well as the liquid jet Reynolds and Ohne-sorge numbers are relevant to the classi.cation of the fragmenta-tion mechanisms [2]. In general, the atomization regimes can be delineated in a similar way as with air assisted droplet atomization 
[5] 
given that similar phenomena have been observed. More recent work has concentrated on the in.uence of gas phase turbulence on atomization [9] 
re-con.rming the in.uence of the Rayleigh–Taylor instability in these types of .ows, whilst also extending previous work to account for a dimensionless measure of turbulent .uctua-tions. For more details on air-blast atomization the reader is direc-ted to the extensive literature on the subject as reviewed by Lasheras and Hop.ngerg . 
Effervescent atomization, a technique developed by Lefebvre and Wang [10] 
has not yet reached the level of maturity as its air-blast counterpart even though the mechanisms which lead to frag-mentation in this type of atomizer are now broadly understood as reviewed in Sovani et al. [11]. The ratio of effervescent air to liquid mass .ow-rate (the gas to liquid ratio or GLR) is a critical parame-ter that dictates the nature of the bubbly .ow inside the nozzle. The atomization mechanism is largely controlled by the size of bubbles as well as the void fraction in the nozzle (creating bubbly, slug or annular .ow) [11]. The geometry of the atomizer, such as the size and number of aeration holes, ori.ce diameter and GLR all dictate the nature of the two phase .ow and the subsequent droplet size [12–17]. Bubble nucleation is also an important issue in effervescent atomization and this has been studied in a two dimensional con.guration by Lhuissier and Villermaux [18]. Effer-vescent atomization has also been utilized in combustion, where rather than aeration using air, a .ammable gas is injected into the liquid serving both as the atomizing gas as well as part of the combustible mixture [19]. Gadgil and Raghunandan [20] 
examined instability characteristics in greater detail including quantifying the bursting distance which leads to atomization, while other work by Schroder et al. [21] 
has analysed instabilities in very viscous liq-uids. Computations of effervescent atomization, while scarce, are gradually evolving, and Qian et al. [22] 
have reproduced some aspects of the experimental data, but more development is still needed. 
It is clear from the literature that effervescent atomization occurs only at some liquid jet diameters downstream of the nozzle [11], and this has generally been attributed to the expansion of air as the two phase mixture leaves the ori.ce channel encountering a sudden pressure drop. However, more recent work by Shepard [23] 
suggests that longitudinal instabilities in the .ow direction dictate the atomization process. He argued that atomizing packets resem-ble colliding portions of liquid as opposed to bursting bubbles. This conclusion was a result of observing radially expelled as opposed to spherically expelled liquid. The latter is more representative of a bubble explosion while a longitudinal collision dominates the former, as in Meier et al. [24]. 
In many practical applications where effervescent atomization is likely to be used, it is possible that it is employed in tandem with a coaxially .owing air stream. This hybrid mode would be intu-itively expected to affect the mixing characteristics, droplet size as well as general atomization phenomena. To the authors’ knowl-edge, there has been no systematic investigation which considers the combined impact of an effervescent component driving atomization due to aeration in the liquid, and a coaxially .owing air component which drives atomization due to interfacial instabil-ities. The literature has investigated situations where an air .ow exists both within and external to a liquid annulus [25], however this is different from effervescent atomization where the air is injected directly into the liquid. Additionally, effervescent atomiza-tion is known to be unstable, and though the mechanism of the instability formation requires further investigation, it is known that the instabilities are related to the void fraction in the nozzle [15,21,20,26,27]. Given the pulsations that occur in effervescent atomization, which are nevertheless accompanied by greatly reduced droplet sizes, it is possible that with the addition of an atomizing air-blast component, the pulsating characteristics can be modi.ed. 
In this contribution we present a system which allows for a hybrid atomization mechanism to take place near to the liquid injection nozzle. Making use of laser/phase Doppler anemometry, microscopic high speed backlight imaging as well as advanced image processing techniques, we present and analyse mean .ow and mixing characteristics for the case of effervescent and combined effervescent–airblast atomization. Spectral analysis is performed both on the LDA data as well as on the high speed image sequences in order to examine the in.uence of the airblast compo-nent on the effervescently induced instabilities as a function of blasting air, as well as spatial location in the spray. 
The paper will .rst present the atomizer, and subsequently outlines the experimental techniques used with associated errors. Secondly, we will present key results characterizing this hybrid fragmentation process in terms of morphology. Then, we present and discuss the .ow-.eld and mixing characteristics before ana-lyzing the dominant instabilities and other quantitative features of the near-.eld atomization zone. 
2. Experimental methods 
The atomizer used for these experiments is shown in Fig. 1.It has an overall length of approximately 130 mm and consists of an ‘outside-in’ effervescent component as originally presented by these authors in Kourmatzis et al. [28], but now with a high speed air stream which .ows coaxially to the central two phase liquid core, consisting of standard tap water and air. The effervescent design consists of 16 aeration holes each of a diameter of 
0.75 mm, equally spaced apart by 1 mm and perpendicular to the direction of liquid .ow. For these experiments, the inner diameter of the effervescent nozzle steps down from 2 mm to a .nal ori.ce of diameter Dl = 500 lm. The nozzle, shown in zone A of Fig. 
1 is kept .ush with the blasting air which .ows through a tube of diameter, D = 12 mm. The spray is ejected downwards into atmo-spheric conditions where a variety of cases were investigated as speci.ed in Table 
1. The exit Weber number, de.ned for air blast cases only is given by Weexit . qU2Dl=r where U is the air blast mean velocity, r is the surface tension of water and q the density of air. The GLR values presented suggest that all of the conditions tested here are either in a homogeneous bubbly .ow or slug .ow break-up regime with no case exhibiting an annular break-up .ow, which would typically require a GLR > 5% [11]. Observations of multiple small bubbles within the liquid jet would agree with this assessment. Given the very low air-.ow rates necessary for effer-vescent atomization, a narrow range Bronkhorst (EL-FLOW MFC PN64) gas mass .ow controller was used providing a maximum output of 10 ln/min with ‘ln’ denoting normal litres per minute, with a standard accuracy of 0.5%. The liquid was supplied at room temperature through a FP1/8-20-G-5/81 Tri-.at rotameter with an accuracy of at least 5% over the measurement range. The injected pressure of the air was measured just upstream of the ejection noz-zle and ranged from 15 to 180 kPa, as measured using a Wika Swiss movement analogue pressure gauge with a maximum range of 250 kPa. 

2.1. LDA system 
A commercial laser Doppler anemometry system (TSI Model FSA 3500/4000) has been used for characterization of particle velocity where full details on errors and uncertainties have been provided in Gounder et al. [29]. In these experiments, the receiver is positioned in a 45 forward scattering con.guration where the assembly transmits two pairs of beams with wavelengths 
514.5 nm and 488 nm to measure the axial and radial components of velocity respectively, with typically 10,000 samples in each channel being collected per run. A Bragg cell is utilized to shift one beam from each pair by 40 MHz to allow measurement of velocity in the negative direction. Built-in probe volume correction (PVC) has been implemented to correct for lower detectability of small particles towards the measurement volume edge due to the Gaussian light intensity pro.le. Throughout this contribution, we sub-range velocity statistics and present data which has been sampled from droplet sizes in the range 0 < d < 10 lm. As the PDA instrument cannot measure non-spherical droplets of which a substantial number are present in effervescent atomization, we sub-range over a narrow range of spherical droplets in order to remove bias amongst different spray cases. Additionally, this acts as a close representation of the gas phase velocity so that the mean and rms .ow velocity mentioned throughout the paper is obtained from these LDA measurements, sub-ranged from the droplets in the range 0 < d < 10 lm. Furthermore, given the large velocity gradients which can be present in a hybrid effervescent–airblast atomizer, all LDA data is normalized for velocity bias in real-time. 
Where an FFT is conducted on the LDA data, there is a restric-tion on the maximum frequency measurable which is dictated by the frequency of particle detection through the LDA probe volume. Therefore, at outer radial locations, where generally lower particle concentrations are present, maximum frequencies measurable in some instances could not exceed 600 Hz without introducing aliasing. 

2.2. Imaging system 
A high speed diode laser operated at 532 nm and 10 kHz was employed as the high speed light source (Edgewave INNOSLAB model HD3011E) for the microscopic imaging studies and is placed in a backlit arrangement from the camera. The average laser power used in these experiments was 20 W resulting in 2 mJ/pulse. Two opal glass diffusing optical components were used to diffuse the light before crossing the measurement volume. A High Speed Star 6 LaVISION camera, synchronized to the laser at 10 kHz was used with a Questar QM100 long working distance microscope objec-tive. In these experiments, the spatial resolution of the system was approximately 3.7 lm per pixel with a total imaging window size of 768 pixels square. For each downstream location and for each case investigated, 3000 images were collected. Instability res-olution is a key aspect of the work presented here, and as will be shown in later sections of this paper, most atomization modes were in the range of 400 < f < 600 Hz. Hence, with an image sam-pling rate of 10,000 Hz and 3000 image samples in total, 150 images are available to resolve the 500 Hz frequency. The image processing script and methodology employed has been fully docu-mented in Kourmatzis et al. [30] 
along with a detailed account of uncertainties. Brie.y, the image processing technique accounts for defocused objects through a calibration against monodisperse droplet streams, while it also statistically accounts for droplet merging through an appropriate choice of binarization threshold. 
The technique itself has been validated against typical air-blast sprays through comparison with PDA measurements, showing errors in SMD that do not exceed 12% [30] 
with errors in monodis-perse size estimation not exceeding 10% on average. 
For global scale imaging of the spray down to a .eld of view of approximately 50 mm, a Nikon-SLR camera was used with a mea-sured .ash pulse width of 15 ms, providing line integrated Mie Scattering images. A black background was placed behind the mea-surement volume and all images shown have been colour inverted for ease of observation. 
3. Atomization morphology 
Fig. 2 shows some typical instantaneous global scale images of the atomization process over a total distance of 50 mm which encompasses both the initial primary atomization zone as well as regions where entrainment and dispersion take place. This is con-sistent with other work by Kourmatzis and Masri [9] 
which has shown that the primary atomization region is generally completed within a few liquid jet diameters over this Weber number range. From a qualitative point of view it is clear that going from columns

For cases with a lower GLR, including ones not shown here, the effervescent com-ponent only acts to destabilize the liquid column slightly, injecting bubbles into the liquid core in such a way that a .ne mist is not observable. In those situations, the addition of an airblast compo-nent has a substantial effect on the overall dispersion of the spray and this is clearly seen through column Cb going from Ra to Rd, where large scale motions in the surrounding gas phase entrain into the central column promoting mixing. The arrows shown on column Ca will be referred to in a later section and indicate the typical lengthscale of large scale instabilities which occur due to entrainment from the surrounding air. 
In the case of more substantial effervescent air, such as that of column Cc with a GLR of 2.7%, the degree of dispersion is substan-tial over all values of the air-blast component showing a lesser dependency of the overall degree of dispersion from the air-blast mode. However, as will be seen through later results, the air-blast component still acts to improve mixing in the primary atomization zone. It also assists in the removal of dominant unde-sired instabilities from the effervescent mode; features that are not observable from Fig. 
2, but considered in the following sections. 



3.1. Microscopic imaging: effervescent atomization 
Fig. 3 shows high speed image sequences for cases with no air-blast component and a GLR of 0.1%, 0.4%, 0.9–2.7% from top to bot-tom for the liquid .ow-rate speci.ed in Table 
1. Concentrating on the top row, large in.ated and isolated liquid bags are observable in the central column which, through observation of hundreds of images for this case, are generally not statistically likely for cases with a GLR greater than approximately 0.5%. For the case of the GLR of 0.1% some of the structures that are observable, shown here in the .rst two frames of the top row, represent a radial bulging of the liquid that is not consistent with a bubble explosion event. This observation has also been made in Shepard [23] 
and may support the existence of axial velocity .uctuations, as in Meier et al. [24] 
which partly drive the effervescent atomization process. For larger GLR ratios, the bag like structures tend to coalesce together which indicates that an upstream portion of liquid moves faster than its downstream counterpart. This coalescence leads to instability which can further atomize the liquid jet. 
Moving on to the third and fourth rows, more substantial atomization is observed. For the highest GLR case shown in the fourth row, the higher void fraction destabilizes the liquid column and leads to atomization which occurs from the core outwards. This type of atomization is markedly different to what would be expected in the case of a laminar liquid jet exposed to a high speed coaxially .owing air stream. In these cases, atomization is driven by interfacial instabilities and therefore begins at the surface of the core. 

3.2. Microscopic imaging: hybrid atomization 
Fig. 4 shows the in.uence of blast air on an effervescent mode of atomization. The top three rows show case Ef3 from Table 1 with an air-blast velocity of 10, 20, and 30 m/s and the bottom row shows case Ef4 with an air-blast velocity of 30 m/s. Comparing row 1 of Fig. 4 with row 3 of Fig. 3 similar features are visible, and portions of liquid are being expelled radially outward. Whilst the time resolution to con.rm that these radial expulsions are due to collision events is not available, the morphology is in qual-itative agreement with the arguments of Shepard [23]. At a velocity of 20 m/s some sinusoidal instability can be discerned although this is not clear until a blast velocity of 30 m/s shown in the third row of Fig. 4. 
Comparing the third row of Fig. 4 to the third row of Fig. 3 the in.uence of the coaxial air.ow is apparent. In the third row of Fig. 4, bubbles are clearly visible in the liquid core and these are superimposed with a sinusoidal instability from the surrounding air with the liquid column having thinned. The reader should note that the liquid jet is not less atomized in this area (as will also be seen in Section 6). This particular image sequence has been chosen to highlight the presence of a primary instability superimposed  onto the effervescent core. A feature not observable in the pure effervescent cases. 
The fourth row of Fig. 4 shows that even with the higher effer-vescent air contribution, superimposed instabilities are still observable. The reader should note again that these images have been chosen to highlight the superimposed instabilities from the air-blast mode. Through observation of hundreds of other images not shown here, it is very clear that the case of the fourth row of Fig. 4 
exhibits substantially more atomization than that seen from these selected images. The reader is directed to Fig. 3 for a better visualization of the in.uence of the effervescent mode on the atomization morphology. 
Fig. 5 shows case Ef3 at three different blast velocities (10, 20– 30 m/s from top to bottom) but at 5.3 mm downstream from the exit plane. The blasting component of 10 m/s has no visible in.uence on the liquid core and therefore the top row also resembles a typical sit-uation with no blasting air. Unlike at 2.5 mm from the exit plane, where substantial differences were observable from the typical snapshots presented, slightly further downstream the differences are not as obvious. In general, for this effervescent case whilst also for case Ef4 not shown here for brevity, the blasting air does not act to qualitatively change the spray morphology which occurs downstream of the primary atomization zone. However, this does not necessarily mean that the rates of atomization are the same amongst the pure effervescent and hybrid modes, given that the atomization will be dictated by the mean .ow .elds, as well as the turbulence characteristics, both of which are markedly different amongst the sprays. This is examined next, while the quality of the atomization will also be examined in Section 6 onwards. 4. Flow-.eld pro.les Fig. 6 shows the mean velocities Umean and the rms of velocity .uctuations urms for case Ef4 with no blast velocity, and with blast level Bl1 and Bl2 as de.ned in Table 1, at a variety of downstream locations. Cases Bl1 and Bl2 of Fig. 6 are the sprays shown in (Rb, Cc) and (Rc,Cc) of Fig. 2. Concentrating .rst on the top row of Fig. 6, showing the mean velocity, it is clear that the addition of an air-blast component acts to increase the mean velocity at the centre of the spray, but it also alters the velocity pro.le of the .ow at the exit plane. This is a result of entrainment from the surrounding air acting to enhance mixing between the air blast stream and the central effervescent air core. The in.uence of the air-blast mode is particularly clear going from Ef4 to Ef4Bl1 where between r=D .0 and r=D .t=:5, the gradient in velocity has diminished signi.-cantly with the addition of the air blast component. 


4.1. Turbulence felds 
Through observation of the second row of Fig. 6, we can see that the addition of the air blast component has acted to reduce the axial rms of the velocity .uctuations. With the effervescent com-ponent, as discussed in Section 3.1, longitudinal .uctuations are largely due to the presence of air in the liquid jet which causes changes in the void fraction and hence in the local velocity mea-sured. The air blast mode acts to decrease the magnitude of these velocity .uctuations whilst also increasing the level of turbulence surrounding the liquid core. The pro.le of the rms shows these two distinct peaks within the .ow, one marks the peak of the axial instability occurring in the central core driven by effervescent air .uctuations, and the other outer peak, occurring in the surround-ing air, is driven by the air blast mode. This argument can be sub-stantiated due to the absence of the double peak feature of the pure effervescent case of Fig. 
6(d), where the axial rms is driven by instability in the effervescent core. In addition to showing a complex .ow-.eld, this also indicates another possible practical advantage of the addition of an air blast component wherein insta-bilities can be dampened in the core whilst improving the mixing .elds in the surroundings. This will be substantiated upon presen-tation of frequency spectra in Section 5. 
Fig. 7 displays the same measurements as in Fig. 6 but now showing the in.uence of going from effervescent case Ef3 to Ef5 for a .xed blast level of Bl2. Unlike case Ef4 shown in Fig. 6, case Ef3 is poorly atomized in the centre hence resulting in a dense core with a velocity closer to the liquid jet as shown in Fig. 7(a). Case Ef5Bl2 of Fig. 7(b) shows a very similar pro.le of the mean axial velocity as with Ef4Bl2 from Fig. 6(c) hence suggesting that at a GLR of 2.7% and above, the effervescent component atomizes the core ef.ciently, given that a statistical increase in velocity would be related to a lower population of larger fragments. The axial rms values of the second row of Fig. 7 show high gradients in the centreline and observations that can generally be made upon observation of Fig. 6. However, case Ef3 shows an rms value which is higher at x/D = 2.5 when compared to x/D = 0. The precise reason for this is unknown though it is likely attributed to the poor atomization at the exit plane which result in a central liquid core with instabilities that only develop much further downstream. 5. Instability characteristics In Section 4 a key result with regards to the role of the air blast component was that it can act to reduce the velocity .uctuations in the centreline. Additionally, the hybrid mode can broaden the velocity pro.le and introduces two shear layers, as shown by the double peak in the rms pro.les. From the literature it is well known that effervescent atomization is unstable [15,21,20,26,27]  and therefore it is of interest to examine the nature of the instabilities in the context of a hybrid atomization system. This is particularly important given that effervescent atomization is driven by intense .uctuations that occur in the liquid core. This is substantially different from air blast atomization which is a combination of inter-facial instabilities and gas phase mixing. 

5.1. Velocity time series FFT 
The instability frequencies are .rst examined through spectral analysis of the velocity time series from the LDA measurements. The FFT amplitudes are all normalized by their respective centreline values. Observing Fig. 8(a) and (b) it is clear that regard-less of the air blast component, the dominant frequency at the core of the spray is similar to within a few percent. This is in agreement with the results of Section 4.1 which showed that the peak in the axial velocity .uctuations did not fully dissipate with the addition of air blast. Fig. 8(a) and (b) also shows that by r/D = 0.09, the normalized FFT amplitude for the hybrid case is similar to that of the pure effervescent case at r/D = 0.13. This clearly indicates the ability for the hybrid mode of atomization to dampen frequency instabilities closer to the central core. The results indicate that in applications where instabilities are to be avoided, the addition of an air blast component can dampen frequency .uctuations closer to the injection point. 
The reader should note that the frequency spectra can also be determined from the blockage area, or the counted ratio of ‘spray pixels’ eNST to total pixels eNT T. A spray pixel here refers to a pixel in the image where a fragment or portion of a fragment is located. This is determined after binarizing the image as described in Kour-matzis et al. [30], such that a spray pixel is a ‘black’ pixel of inten-sity value 1 and any other pixel is part of the background, with intensity value 0. In the context of a spray, this can also be consid-ered as a measure of the area fraction. An FFT analysis of the block-age area for case Ef4 and Ef4Bl2 (not shown) yielded frequencies of approximately 500 Hz. This compares very well with the estimate from the LDA velocity time series. The results con.rm the LDA spectra but also demonstrate that the instability in the axial veloc-ity .uctuations are inextricably linked to the variation in the area fraction, or blockage area of the liquid core. 

5.2. Analysis of frequency response 
To summarize so far, the overall frequencies measured have not shown sensitivity to the addition of an air-blast component. 
Additionally, in the case of a pure air blast component, in these experiments, a dominant frequency was not measurable from the time resolved microscopic images at the exit plane, and in all cases this suggests that the effervescent component dominates in that near-.eld region. 
Generally however, dominant break-up frequencies do exist for pure air-blast atomization. One frequency is associated with the overall ‘break-up’ frequency which has been measured by Raynal 
[31] whilst a general shedding frequency has also been estimated by Engelbert et al. [4]. Such frequencies have also been con.rmed by Kourmatzis and Masri [32] in other work, however here, pure air-blast frequencies cannot be accurately measured as the full break-up of the pure air-blast mode cannot be visualized in a single .eld of view. In the context of the sprays studied here, of particular interest is to compare the dominant effervescent frequency mea-sured, to those associated with large scale mixing. This large scale mixing is a key aspect of air-blast atomization given the coaxial .ow which encourages entrainment from the surrounding air [2]. The arrows on Fig. 2 show the size of typical instabilities acting on the overall spray core which are largely related to entrainment. These are not to be confused with the primary instability which occurs at the exit of the liquid nozzle and is much smaller, gener-ally of the order of the liquid jet diameter as reviewed elsewhere [2]. 
Some typical larger instability length-scales K have been mea-sured for cases of a pure air blast component with a velocity of 10, 20, 30 and 47 m/s and these are of the order of 19, 9, 7.5 and 7 mm. These waves are considered to travel along the main spray core at a velocity given by the cluster velocity, empirically de.ned by Engelbert et al. [4] 
by Eq. (1): . 2 T where UG is the blast air mean velocity and Ul the mean liquid jet velocity. Determining a global frequency as f . VC =K gives val-ues equal to 58 Hz, 333 Hz, 557 Hz and 909 Hz for velocities of 10, 20, 30 and 47 m/s respectively where the cases of a mean of 20 and 30 m/s are representative of cases Bl1 and Bl2 of Table 1. These fre-quencies are of the order of the dominant effervescent frequencies examined here, where cases Ef1–Ef5 of Table 1 ranged from 300 to 600 Hz. This indicates that the dominant effervescent pulsation frequencies can be of the same order of magnitude as dominant mixing frequencies originating from large scale instabilities, due to the air-blast mode. Therefore, there will be instances where the rate at which .uid is ejected due to effervescent atomization can be of the same order of magnitude as the rate at which air is entrained into the core. 
6. Blockage area and atomization 
The frequency range has not been observed to change with radial location or with the addition of an air blast component, though the intensity is dampened. However, microscopic imaging of the near .eld zone revealed that some morphological differences do exist amongst the pure effervescent and hybrid variants and this must be analysed further. 
Fig. 9 shows plots of the blockage area or two dimensional area fraction plotted vs. the image number where each image is sepa-rated by 100 ls. The arrows on the plots for Ef3Bl2 and Ef3 on Fig. 9 show typical ‘pulse widths’ where one pulse is indicative of the liquid jet atomizing. A high magnitude of AS=AT indicates a liq-uid jet which is nearly intact whereas a low magnitude indicates its atomized or nearly atomized state. As an example, if measure-ments were made in a constant area liquid jet then a horizontal line with a positive value of AS=AT would be obtained. 
From observation of Fig. 9, the pure effervescent case shows typically longer pulse widths, which indicates that intact liquid cores remain over longer periods, from cycle to cycle. In contrast, for a case where there is some blasting component, upon atomiza-tion due to the effervescent air, the surrounding coaxial air will penetrate the liquid column hence promoting dispersion and atomization and leaving a gap in time where no liquid is visible. This leads to shorter pulse widths. The in.uence of the blasting mode on the total liquid fragment area at the exit plane can be sta-tistically analysed through calculation of the mean blockage ratio referred to here as hAS=AT i and this is provided in the next section. 



6.1. Mean areas and ligament sizes 
Fig. 10 shows the magnitude of hAS=AT i for a variety of cases as bars. Also plotted on Fig. 10 is the mean size of ligaments in the near-.eld. Ligaments have been de.ned as those objects detected in the high speed images with an aspect ratio AR > 3 [30]. Whilst there is the limitation of a single line integrated .eld of view, the binarization routine chosen has been calibrated as shown in Kourmatzis et al. [30] and has proven to yield physically consistent data. Ligament sizes, particularly in effervescent atomization, are critical in describing the atomization process as also observed by Sutherland et al. [33] and therefore we focus on characterization of these objects here. Additionally, the separate analysis of larger fragments with respect to droplets, as also done in Ghaemi et al. 

Fig.11.StandarddeviationofareafractioneAS=AT T0forcasesEf2(GLR=0.4%),Ef3(GLR=0.9%)andEf4(GLR=2.7%)atthreedifferentairblastmagnitudesatx=D =0.44.[27] for effervescent atomizers, is critical in accurately describing the atomization process. 
First of all, we concentrate on the hAS=AT i measurements. Taking case Ef3 as an example, Fig. 10 shows that at x = 2.5 mm and x = 5.3 mm the area fraction change is minimal when going from no blast to Bl1 whereas an increase to Bl2 leads to a substantial reduction in hAS=AT i.At x = 8.1 mm the in.uence of the air-blast component on the mean area fraction is also signi.cant given that the break-up length of the air-blast mode is shifted slightly further downstream as was also discussed in Section 3.2. Similar conclu-sions are reached by observation of case Ef2 and Ef4 though case Ef4 is less sensitive to the blasting mode. This is attributed to the more substantial in.uence of the effervescent mode in case Ef4 on the atomization characteristics of the near-.eld, which is dis-cussed further now in the context of the ligament sizes Dlig . Unlike the area fraction which provides a global measure of the atomiza-tion and dispersion performance including droplet statistics, the ligament statistics deal only with elongated fragments as de.ned in Kourmatzis et al. [30]. 
For case Ef4 at all downstream locations, it is clear that the mean ligament size is largely unaffected by the addition of an air-blast mode, and this is particularly true at x = 8.1 mm down-stream even though the area fraction has decreased slightly. Though substantial differences in the .ow pro.les between a pure effervescent and hybrid mode were noted earlier in Section 4, the added in.uence of the air-blast mode does not largely alter the near-.eld primary atomization characteristics as de.ned by the ligament size. This indicates a signi.cant advantage of a hybrid fragmentation process such as the one employed here, where liga-ment size can be dictated by the effervescent mode, but dispersion, downstream mixing and instabilities can be partly altered by the blast mode. For the cases of a lower level of effervescent air (Ef2 and Ef3), the blasting mode has a substantial in.uence on the liga-ment size at x = 5.3 mm and x = 8.1 mm. However, this is not the case at the exit plane where changes are minimal andeven show an increase when moving from no blast to Bl1 and .nally to Bl2. This increase in ligament size from no blast to Bl2 at the exit plane is attributed to the shift in the break-up length further downstream. 
Further insight can be gained by observing the .uctuation in the area fraction for the various cases and this is illustrated through the standard deviation of the area fraction eAS=AT T0 in Fig. 11. Once more, the in.uence of the blasting mode on the near-.eld atomiza-tion is clear. With the absence of an air-blast component, the .uc-tuation in the area fraction increases substantially with GLR, indicating pulsations in the core. However, the addition of the blasting mode shows, across all GLR values tested, that the stan-dard deviation remains roughly constant and this is particularly true of case Bl2. At low GLR values, higher standard deviations are noted for the hybrid cases when compared to the pure efferves-cent case due to the presence of the blasting mode. This occurs most likely through a combination of interfacial instabilities driven by the high shear at the exit as well as entrainment from the sur-rounding air. 
7. Conclusions 
Characteristics of combined effervescent and airblast atomiza-tion have been investigated through a number of experiments which offer a comprehensive study on the atomization mecha-nisms of this hybrid form of fragmentation. Both global and near-.eld images have been provided showing that the morphol-ogy of a hybrid atomization system is different to that of a pure effervescent system showing a superposition of sinusoidal instabil-ities onto a bubbly two phase core. The pulsating frequency of the effervescent atomization mode does not change even with the presence of an airblast component, however the addition of the coaxial .ow does signi.cantly dampen the intensity of the .uctu-ations. This has been con.rmed both through measurement of axial velocity .uctuations, and through spectral analysis of the velocity time series and area fraction of the sprays. Analysis of the pulsating frequencies with respect to typical instability time-scales suggests that there can be a close coupling between the effervescent a omization frequency and the frequency at which the liquid phase is mixed with the surroundings. Area fraction results show that from one atomizing pulsation to the next, the coaxial .ow allows for entrainment of air in the central core thereby in.uencing the degree of atomization and dispersion when compared to the pure effervescent mode. Furthermore, for GLR levels below 2.7%, the air-blast mode can have a substantial impact on the ligament sizes at the exit plane. The atomization technique demonstrates that whilst effervescent atomization is a more ef.-cient mode of liquid fragmentation, the addition of the air blast component can act to improve dispersion characteristics whilst simultaneously dampening or restricting undesired pulsations. 














TWO-PHASE FLOW SIMULATION OF HIGH-PRESSURE GAS ATOMIZATION EFFECT OF MOLTEN METAL AND ATOMIZING GAS PROPERTIES ON DROPLET SIZE DISTRIBUTION
This paper deals with the physics of high-pressure gas atomization in metal powder production. To gain understanding of the effect of gas pressure on droplet size distribution, a numerical two-phase .ow study is performed using Eulerian-Eulerian Volume of Fluid (VOF) interface tracking method. Annular-slit, close-coupled gas atomizer is considered to atomize molten aluminum using nitrogen as the atomizing gas. Four cases with different gas pressures are considered, while geometry and other operational param-eters are .xed. Characteristics of several interfacial instabilities have been identi.ed at different stages of the atomization process. Despite the increment in the rate of the atomization with the increasing gas pressure, deformation characteristics and the breakup mechanisms remain unchanged. Droplet size and the cumulative volume distributions indicate that the effectiveness of the atomization process increases with the elevating gas pressure. Cumulative volume obtained from the numerical simulations at low gas pressures display similar trends to the experimental results. 
1. Introduction 
Metal powder production is in high demand for its applications in rapid prototyping, injection molding, and additive manufactur-ing. Metal powder used in additive layer manufacturing is required to have precisely tailored metal powder with a certain size, shape, and morphology [1]. Lawley [2] 
reviewed many existing powder manufacturing technologies and discussed the superiority of gas atomization among other methods considering its controllability over powder size distribution. In gas atomization, a pressurized gas is used to atomize the molten metal. Momentum and thermal energy [3] 
transferred from the expanding gas to the molten metal facilitates disintegration and atomization. The rate of interfacial momentum and thermal energy transfer depends on the driving potential and the interfacial area. Since the cumulative interfacial area increases with the atomization process, it increases the atomization rate to several orders of magnitude [4]. The main advantage of the gas atomization is the controllability [5] 
of the powder size, shape, and the morphology. It is important to study the effect of each operating parameter on the atomization process and the powder distributions. 
The atomization process can be divided into two regimes such as primary and secondary atomization (Fig. 
1a). The primary atomization regime starts when the melt interacts with the gas .ow near the melt tip. Then, the melt stream will deform and cre-ate unstable wave-like structures, when it breaks up into ligaments and large droplets. The secondary atomization regime begins fur-ther downstream when the large droplets and ligaments extend due to Rayleigh-Plataeu instability and break up into smaller dro-plets. This breakup process will continue until the critical Weber number is reached or till the droplet solidi.es [1,6]. 
Several numerical simulations have been performed to study different aspects [7–9] 
of the atomization process. Some of these early studies could not successfully predict the atomization pro-cess as they neglect the strong feedback from the highly dense melt stream [10]. The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach [3,11–13] 
was .rst used to investigate the molten metal atomization and particularly the secondary breakup. The main drawback of these discrete element methods is their inability to predict the primary atomization [10]. These simulations often used random droplet size distribution [14] 
(DSD) to initiate the simulation. Considering these drawbacks, Tong and Browne [10] 
performed the .rst Eulerian-Eulerian based simulations using the front-tracking method. This and other papers [15–17] 
showed that the gas dynamics can be signi.cantly affected by the topological evolution of the melt stream. However, these studies were either conducted in two-dimensional geometries [10,15] 
or considered only the early stages of the atomization process [18]. 
In this study, the gas atomization process of molten aluminum at different gas pressures is studied using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model [19] 
together with geometrical reconstruction method in OpenFOAM software. The method is Eulerian-Eulerian and does not involve any semi-empirical correlation or any facili-tation of droplet breakup as it occurs naturally without any mod-eling. The effect of atomization gas pressure on the droplet size distribution is investigated. To obtain the effect of inlet gas pres-sure, four inlet gas pressures are considered while keeping other parameters such as melt .ow rates, melt and gas physical proper-ties the same. This paper deals with both primary and secondary breakup processes in conjunction with the calculation of dropsize distribution to understand the trends in gas pressure. Even though a very .ne mesh is required to resolve both types of atomization completely, some characteristics of the secondary breakup process have been identi.ed in the simulation through the calculation of ligament aspect ratio. The objective of this work is to predict the trend of the drop size with pressure and compare this trend with the experimental trend by discriminating dropsize based on aspect ratio. 
2. Computational model 
The computational domain (Fig. 
1) is designed based on a dou-ble induction, discrete nozzle, close-coupled gas atomizer, which consists of 18 circular gas nozzles evenly spaced around the melt tube. The computational domain follows the experimental set up (not shown here) but uses an annular-slit instead of individual nozzles. Since the velocity in the slit is maintained the same as in experiments, the mass .ux is different and only trends in pres-sure can be determined. Once the melt enters the atomization chamber, the interaction with the atomization gas initiates the pri-mary atomization. Larger droplets will atomize into much smaller droplets, while progressing downstream. 
In this study, four gas inlet pressures (1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 MPa) were used to atomize molten aluminum in the annular-slit, close-coupled atomizer. Fig. 
1b shows a schematic view of the atomizer geometry. Three-dimensional calculations are done in the 90 wedge 
(Fig. 
1c), and the mirror images in the other three quadrants would complete the picture. This is primarily done to reduce the computational power requirement, while imposing two independent symmetry boundaries. Therefore, the results are not fully axi-symmetric as would be the case with a two-dimensional axi-symmetric problem. Axial and the radial lengths of the computational domain are chosen to be 100 mm and 20 mm, respectively to reduce the computational domain which is large enough to determine primary and secondary atomization. A structured mesh with 11.8 million cells was prepared using the blockMesh utility available in OpenFoam. The volume equivalent grid size ranges from 70lm to 700lm. Consider-ing the shape of the cylindrical geometry, grid size increases radially outward. Aspect ratio-based .ltered data corresponding to a .ner mesh with 20.2 M cells (volume equivalent grid size ranges from 50 to 500 lm and 60% of the grid cells are smaller than 100 lm) are compared with the results corresponding to 11.8 M cells. The normalized cumulative volume results show less than 1% change. However, a clear increment in the total number of droplets in the .ner mesh can be observed. All the results shown have been obtained for 11.8 million cells. 
Table 
1 
shows the boundary conditions used in the simulations. k represents the turbulent kinetic energy. The physical properties of Aluminum and Nitrogen are provided in Table 
2. 
A zero-gradient (Neumann boundary) condition for turbulence kinetic energy is imposed on the solid walls for high Reynolds numbers, i.e., turbulence wall function mentioned in Table 
1. The effect of boundary layer developed near the solid wall is assumed to be negligible. Boundary layer developed near the melt-gas inter-face plays a major role in the atomization process. Turbulence intensity is speci.ed at both melt and gas inlets. This boundary condition determines the turbulence kinetic energy based on the speci.ed turbulence intensity and induced mean velocity. To facil-itate reverse .ow, a special outlet condition is imposed for velocity. Nitrogen is used as the atomization gas and constant values are used for density and kinematic viscosity. 
The hydrodynamic Courant number (C . uDt=Dx) is kept at 0.3 and the interfacial Courant number at 0.1. High induced gas veloc-ity ( 1500 m/s) and a suf.ciently .ne mesh restricted the time step required to follow the Courant number criterion for a stable solution to about 10 ns. Considering the number of cells and avail-able computational resources, all the simulations are carried out to the physical time of 2 ms. Computational power required for 1 MPa gas pressure simulation is around 30,000 processor hours (250 pro-cessors for 5 days). 
In this study, the dynamics of the melt-gas interface is simu-lated using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method, which is discretized using Finite Volume Method (FVM) on OpenFOAM framework. The ‘isoAdvector’ geometrical interface reconstruction method [20,21] 
is used to improve the sharpness of the interface, while ensuring the continuity of each phase. For an incompressible .ow, the mass, momentum and volume fraction conservation equations are as follows. 
where !U is velocity, q density, P pressure, T viscous stress tensor, 
! !
Fb body forces, Fr surface tension force, and a phase volume frac-tion. In VOF method, volume fraction has values of 1 and 0 corre-sponding to liquid and gas phases, while intermediate values represent the interface. Continuous surface force (CSF) method 
[22] 
is used to model the surface tension force as a body force, which only has non-zero values at the interface. The surface tension force is de.ned [22] 
as follows, 
where, r is the surface tension coef.cient, j local interfacial curva-ture and ! n represents the interfacial normal. Density and viscosity are interpolated based on the volume fraction. Large Eddy Simula-tion (LES) is used in these simulations to solve for the large-scale eddies, while modeling small scale eddies. These sub-grid scale (SGS) eddies are modelled following the one equation eddy viscos-ity model [23]. 
A post-processing code is developed to obtain the droplet size distribution using volume fraction. Initially, a threshold in volume fraction is utilized to identify the liquid cell identi.cation numbers. A list is .rst generated including only the neighbor cells that have liquid in them. Then, these sets are compared and appended if they have common elements. The common sets represent the cells cor-responding to each droplet [24]. Special care is given to the calcu-lation of the number and size of droplets that share cells with symmetry boundaries as their sizes and velocities must be updated accordingly. Modi.cations are made to obtain the effect of droplets leaving the computational domain. The code is modi.ed to approx-imate the droplets, which has the potential to leave the computa-tional domain within a given time interval. These approximated droplets are then added to the .nal droplet size distribution. In addition, the aspect ratio (AR) of each droplet was calculated. It is de.ned as the ratio of the longest dimension of the liquid entity to the diameter of the sphere with equivalent liquid volume. Therefore, the aspect ratio represents the degree of deformation of a droplet or a ligament with respect to a spherical droplet with equivalent volume. This enables the comparison of the atomization processes, which progress at different rates i.e. varying gas pres-sures are expected to change the rate of atomization. 
3. Results and discussion 
Since a direct comparison of numerical and experimental data is not possible for reasons mentioned in the previous section (i.e., an annular-slit is used in computations with the gas velocity main-tained at the experimental velocity; the use of incompressible .ow; a smaller computational domain), only the trends obtained for different gas pressures are compared. The melt diameter, funnel-length, and gas nozzle angle are maintained the same as in experiments. 
Fig. 
2 
shows a qualitative comparison of the cumulative droplet volume obtained at .ve gas pressures (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 MPa). It is clear that the increasing gas pressure facilitates better atomiza-tion in terms of yield. The experimental data show no increase in atomization beyond 2.5 MPa. The normalized volume curve dis-plays a steep slope with respect to droplet diameter. The numerical simulations in Fig. 
2(b) are made at an early stage of atomization, i.e., at 2 ms. Hence, any comparison with experimental powder data made at the end of the experiment after solidi.cation is expected to have discrepancy. The numerical simulations show that up to 300 lm diameter, there is no signi.cant difference in normalized volume for all pressures. The discrepancy becomes large beyond 300 lm. At large pressures, many droplets are seen to exit the control volume, suggesting a larger computational domain may need to be chosen. 
It is important to note that the larger droplets are not .ltered out in simulations as in experiments. To obtain a complete picture of atomization and capture all droplet deformation and facilitate the breakup of a 100 lm droplet, the mesh resolution should be 
of the order of 1010 cells, which is prohibitively expensive. The cur-rent grid does an adequate job of allowing an early stage analysis of atomization. The current computational geometry is 100 mm in length and 20 mm in diameter. Therefore, some of the droplets can leave the computational geometry before breaking up. The post-processing code can approximate the number of droplets that are leaving the computational domain. 
Since the early stages of atomization are analyzed, an approach would be to understand the simultaneous primary and secondary atomization processes and display the size and cumulative volume of the droplet by discriminating based on the aspect ratio of each droplet. This approach is adopted and discussed in the following 3 .gures. 
In Fig. 
3 
shows the breakup process of a small three-dimensional liquid mass. For clarity, this 3-D ligament circled at the top is divided into three ligaments as marked in red, blue and black colors. The ligament marked in red, which was previ-ously attached to the other two ligaments is separated around 510ls (marked in yellow circle). At 550 ls, this ligament is advected with the gas .ow, displaying a neck that will be eventu-ally pinched off into two segments. The ligaments marked in blue and black are extended along their axial direction due to Rayleigh-Plateau instability [25–27] 
when the surface tension minimizes the ligaments into smaller packets with smaller surface area for the same liquid volume. From Figs. 
3 
and 
4, it can be seen that the liq-uid melt undergoes this instability .rst when the cylindrical vol-ume thins and the gas creates more perturbations on the surface. The liquid then collapses under the action of capillary forces again due to surface tension and can be seen to break into smaller dro-plets. These droplets and ligaments are circled in their respective colors to show the breakdown process in the subsequent time intervals. As previously mentioned in literature, these ligaments are subjected to break into smaller droplets to reduce the surface energy density. This instability plays a major role in the secondary atomization process. 
Fig. 
4 
shows the time evolution of 1 and 2.5 MPa gas pressure sim-ulations. The main difference between these two gas pressures is the rate of progression of the atomization process. For the case of 
2.5 MPa, the gas pressure induces a much higher gas velocity and contributes to enhanced atomization due to higher gas momentum .ux. Consider the time evolution of 2.5 MPa gas pressure (second row). First, the gas stream impinges and penetrates the melt stream. At 0.4 ms, the gas penetrates the melt stream and divides it into two portions at the point of impact, while atomization is slower for 1 MPa. The top melt portion moves upwards due to strong gas recirculation for 2.5 MPa to accumulate near the melt tip. Such accumulation of melt near the nozzle does not seem to be a problem for 1 MPa. 
In Fig. 
5, four images at incremental times, images of atomiza-tion, vorticity and turbulence intensity are displayed. The black contours indicate the melt-gas interface. Note that the plane nor-mal vorticity is shown. The positive vorticity values are pointed into the .gure and negative vorticity values are pointed in the opposite direction. The opposite directions in vorticity around the ligaments suggest that the .ow structures induce torque, which leads to rupture. Thus, different types of instabilities con-tribute to secondary atomization. In the turbulence intensity plots 
(i.e – the log scale is used to properly visualize the variations), the turbulence intensity increases near the melt-gas interface. This is due to the chaotic interaction near the melt-gas interface, which creates perturbations and facilitates interfacial instabilities. The boundary layer developed near the melt-gas interface plays a major role in the breakup process, since the shear forces exert on either side determine the deformation of the melt stream and the eventual breakup. The turbulence intensity plots indicate that the turbulence model can resolve these forces successfully. 
The image shown in Fig. 
2 
consists of ligaments, droplets, and liquid blobs during different stages of atomization. Droplet aspect ratio allows one to understand the number of droplets that have possibly undergone both primary and secondary atomization. Fig. 
6 
shows the droplet size histograms for 1 MPa gas pressure. 
Blue represents droplets with AR > 2, and yellow AR < 2. The com-parisons are made at 2 ms. The few droplets that have left the com-putational domain are also included. In general, there is no signi.cant improvement in the droplet distribution as the pressure is increased, although more droplets tend to leave the computa-tional domain. 
In Fig. 
6, most of the droplets are in the range of 100 lmto 300 lm, with the peak around 150 lm. Although 2 ms is in the early stages of atomization, about 50% of the droplets appear to have an aspect ratio of less than 2. It is also clear that it is the

secondary atomization that allows the droplet size (and the even-tual powder size) to be small. At early stages of 2 ms, when the atomization process is not completed, it is still possible to .lter the dropsize information based on aspect ratio and dropsize. In fact, this is what is done in the experiments when the larger drops are .ltered out with the sieve. Fig. 
6 
shows that when the condi-

tions are imposed to account for the droplets that have AR < 2 and dropsize less than 200 lm and 300 lm, about half the number of droplets .t in this category, and the cumulative volume trends (see Fig. 
7) to the left where the cumulative volume is steeper and higher for smaller size droplets. This is seen to be the case in the experiments as well as shown in Fig. 
2(a). A direct comparison is not possible as an annular slit is used instead of multiple nozzles to reduce the total number of cells, nevertheless, the computations predict the trend well. 
4. Conclusions 
In this numerical study, four gas pressures have been consid-ered for gas atomization of aluminum melt. The atomization pro-cess is simulated using Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase numerical framework. The rate of atomization is seen to increase with increasing gas pressure. Droplet size distributions indicate a clear improvement in atomization. Higher gas pressures tend to advect droplets at a higher rate than they are atomized, which may neces-sitate a larger computational domain. Cumulative volume plot indicates a clear increment in the effectiveness of the atomization with increasing gas pressure. The cumulative volume does not change with pressure for up to dropsize of 300 lm. When the dro-plets are further .ltered based on a smaller aspect ratio (<2) and less than 300 lm, the simulations show a better trend in cumula-tive volume and tend to follow the experimental data. Due to the complex nature of computations, direct comparison with experi-ments for Eulerian-Eulerian simulations is prohibitively expensive. However, these simulations have shown their ability to serve as a good guidance for further controlled experiments. Thus, the main advantage of the gas atomization process is its controllability to obtain powder properties, which can be guided by numerical anal-ysis by changing geometrical or operational parameters.

2D mid-infrared laser-absorption imaging for tomographic reconstruction of temperature and carbon monoxide in laminar flames
Abstract
This manuscript presents the design and initial application of a mid-infrared laser-absorption-imaging (LAI) technique for two-dimensional (2D) measurements and tomographic
reconstruction of gas temperature and CO in laminar flames.  In this technique, the output beam from a quantum-cascade laser (QCL) is expanded, passed through the test gas, and imaged in 2D
using a high-speed mid-infrared camera.  The wavelength of the QCL is scanned across the P(0,20) and P(1,14) transitions of CO near 4.8 µm at 50 Hz to provide 2D measurements of path-integrated
gas temperature and CO column density across over 3,300 lines-of-sight simultaneously.  This enabled the first sub-second (0.1 s), high-resolution (140 µm), 2D laser-absorption measurements
and tomographic reconstruction of flame temperature and CO mole fraction using mid-infrared wavelengths.  Prior to entering the test gas, the beam was reflected off two diffusers spinning at
90,000 RPM (≈9400 rad/s) to break the laser coherence and prevent diffraction-induced image artifacts.  This technique was validated with measurements of CO in an isothermal jet and then
demonstrated in laminar, partially premixed, oxygen-ethylene flames despite large background emission from soot and combustion products.
Introduction
Laser-absorption spectroscopy (LAS) is widely used to provide quantitative, calibration-free measurements of chemical species and thermodynamic conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure,
velocity) in a wide range of combustion applications [1].  Typically in LAS, wavelength-tunable laser light with intensity Io is directed through an absorbing gas and the transmitted light intensity
(It) is measured by a photodetector.  Beer’s Law is used to calculate the spectral absorbance (α = −ln(It/Io)) which is then compared with that predicted by spectroscopic models to provide
path-integrated measurements of gas properties along a line-of-sight (LOS). While useful,  many combustion applications demand multi-dimensional measurements of
chemical species and thermodynamic conditions, for example, to resolve the thermochemical structure  of  flames  and/or,  more  generally,  the  spatiotemporal  evolution  of  combustion.   To
meet this need, LAS diagnostics employing multiple LOS [2–8] or mechanical scanning of the LOS [9–12] have been used with and without tomographic reconstruction algorithms to quantify
how gas properties vary in space and time.  In the simplest form, this approach is performed to  provide  spatially  resolved,  path-integrated  measurements  of  species  and  thermodynamic
conditions.  If absorption transitions with appropriate lower-state energy are used, path-averaged properties (e.g., absorbing-species column density, absorbing-species-weighted path-averaged
temperature) can be obtained despite highly non-uniform conditions along the LOS [13].  For
example, Goldenstein et al. [9] and Spearrin et al. [10] developed mid-infrared LAS sensors for
absorbing-species-weighted path-averaged temperature and absorbing-species column density of
H2O, CO, and CO2  in a model-scramjet combustor.  The authors’ mechanically scanned the LOS
in two dimensions (x-y) to map out path-averaged gas properties.  While effective and convenient
to execute in environments with somewhat limited optical access,  this approach can be time
consuming (often requiring minutes per 2D dataset), provides modest spatial resolution (order
1-10 mm) and is not spatially resolved along the LOS.
Alternatively,  numerous  researchers  have  developed  laser-absorption  tomography  (LAT)
techniques to provide tomographic reconstruction of 2D temperature and species fields within
the  measurement  plane  [5, 7, 11, 12, 14–19].    This  approach  provides  the  added  benefit  of
resolving the gas conditions along the line-of-sight; however, it comes at the expense of more
complicated  data  processing  routines  and  steep  demands  for  many  lines-of-sight  (typically
10s  to  1000s  of  LOS  depending  on  the  level  of  spatial  resolution  desired  [14]).   For  these
reasons, LAT techniques developed to date have primarily used near-infrared wavelengths to
exploit relatively inexpensive telecommunication-grade fiber optics (e.g., fibers, multiplexers,
splitters)  and  detectors  [5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15].   Unfortunately,  confinement  to  the  near  infrared
significantly limits the number of chemical species that can be monitored at combustion-relevant
concentrations,  conditions,  and  spatial  scales.   As  such,  the  majority  of  prior  LAT  work  in
combustion applications has focused on detecting H2O via its combination and overtone bands
near 1.4  µm [5, 8, 11, 12].  Additionally, some work has been done to tomographically image
hydrocarbons via their overtone C-H stretch absorption band near 1.7  µm [7] and NH3  via its
overtone and combination bands near 1.5 µm [20].  To overcome this limitation several researchers
have developed LAT techniques employing mid-infrared wavelengths for tomographic imaging
of temperature, CO, and CO2  [16–19], however these works have relied on mechanical scanning
of the line-of-sight, thereby significantly limiting the temporal and spatial resolutions to the order
of seconds to minutes and mm, respectively.
That being said, there remains a critical need to develop mid-infrared LAS and LAT techniques
with  higher  temporal  resolution  and  spatial  resolution  (e.g.,  less  than  1  second  and  1  mm,
respectively).  Recent work by Wei et al. [21] demonstrated significant progress towards achieving
this goal through the use of laser-absorption imaging (LAI) with a high-speed mid-IR camera.
The authors demonstrated the ability to acquire LAS measurements of temperature, CO, CO2, and
C2H6  along ≈400 lines-of-sight (in a single plane) simultaneously to provide 1D measurements
and reconstructions of gas temperature and species concentrations.  Diffraction-induced noise
and image artifacts prevented use of the entire focal plane array and, thus, mechanical scanning
of the measurement plane (in the axial direction) was required to achieve 2D measurements and
reconstructions of flame structure.  Using this technique the authors’ were able to acquire LAS
measurements with a spatial resolution of near 50 and 125  µm in the horizontal and vertical
directions respectively, and a 2D image of flame properties was acquired in < 10 seconds [21].
As a result, this approach provided ≈ 10× smaller spatial resolution and ≈ 100× better temporal
resolution compared to more conventional LAT techniques that rely on translating the LOS in
both the x- and y-direction.
Here we present the development and application of the first mid-infrared laser-absorption
imaging technique capable of providing 2D-measurements and -tomographic reconstruction of
flame temperature and CO concentration without mechanical scanning of the measurement plane.
This was achieved by performing high-speed, 2D imaging of scanned-wavelength, mid-infrared
laser light that was reflected off two ground-glass diffusers spinning at 90,000 RPM prior to
passing through the flame.  Spinning the diffusers was required to break the optical coherence
and,  thus,  prevent  diffraction-induced  image  artifacts.   This  approach  enabled  the  following
advancements in mid-IR LAI: 1) a 8x increase in the number of simultaneous measurement paths
(≈3,300 LOS here compared to 400 LOS in [21]) and 2) a ≈20x improvement in 2D-measurement
time (0.1 seconds here compared to ≈2 seconds in [21]) by avoiding the need to mechanically                                                                          
scan the measurement plane.  We demonstrate that this approach enables 2D measurements of
thermochemical flame structure on near-cm scales with a projected pixel size of ≈ 140  µm and
a  time  resolution  as  small  as  0.1  seconds  (i.e.,  10  Hz).   The  remainder  of  this  manuscript  is
primarily devoted to presenting the design and evaluation of the optical setup and describing how
this LAI technique was applied to provide 2D-measurements and -tomographic reconstruction of
flame temperature and carbon monoxide concentration in flames.
2.    Technical approach and equipment
Figure  1  illustrates  the  experimental  setup  used  for  LAI  of  temperature  and  CO  in  partially
premixed,  oxygen-ethylene  flames.   A  continuous-wave  (CW)  quantum-cascade  laser  (QCL)
providing  30  mW  of  optical  power  at  wavelengths  near  4.8  µm  was  used  to  provide  2D
measurements of absorbance spectra.  The wavelength of the laser was scanned across the P(0,20)
and P(1,14) absorption transitions of CO near 2059.9 and 2060.3 cm−1, respectively, at 50 Hz
via  injection-current  tuning  with  a  700  mV  peak-to-peak  triangle  wave.   The  QCL’s  current
was  scanned  below  its  threshold  current  to  enable  the  background  and  flame  emission  to  be
measured in each pixel immediately before each scan.  The wavelength scanning of the QCL was
characterized using a solid germanium etalon with a free-spectral range near 0.0163 cm−1.  It is
worth noting that the absorption transitions employed here have recently been used to measure
gas temperature and CO in several other combustion environments (e.g., scramjet combustor [10],
pulse-detonation engine [3], and propellant flames [22]).  We refer the reader to [10] for additional
details regarding why these absorption transitions are well suited for studying combustion gases.
A custom built optical assembly (see Fig.  1(a)) was used to expand the laser beam and break
its coherence to prevent diffraction-induced image artifacts (see Section 3) that formed by passing
coherent laser light through apertures in the beam-shaping optics and camera.  The laser beam
was immediately expanded by a 12.7 mm diameter, AR-coated, CaF2, concave lens with a focal
length of -18 mm.  The expanded beam was then directed to a gold-coated, ground-glass diffuser
(ThorLabs DG10-120-M01) with 120 grits/inch (≈ 50 grit/cm).  The gold coating provides > 97%
reflectance  at  an  angle-of-incidence  (AOI)  of  12◦  for  wavelengths  near  4.8  µm.   The  diffuse
reflection was then collimated by a 25.4 mm diameter, AR-coated, silicon lens with a focal length
of 25.4 mm and the beam was then focused onto a second diffuser using a 25.4 mm diameter,
AR-coated, CaF2  lens with a focal length of 40 mm.  The AOI for both of these diffusers was
approximately 20◦.  When aligning the diffusers, the beam was directed to the outer edge of each
diffuser to concentrate the beam onto regions of each diffuser with the highest velocity (while
spinning),  thereby providing more rapid scrambling of the laser light’s coherence.  After the
second diffuser, the laser light was partially collimated by a 50.8 mm diameter, concave mirror
with a focal length of 100 mm.  Close to the viewing plane, the beam was passed through a final
25.4 mm diameter lens (CaF2, focal length of 200 mm) to collimate a portion of the beam which
was directed through the flame and into the high-speed IR camera.
Both of the diffusers were mounted in 25.4 mm diameter lens tubes which were mounted to
a custom aluminum adapter (using two set screws) in order to attach each diffuser to a motor
(Castle Creations 1406 Sensored 4-Pole Brushless Motors, 7700kV). The motors were powered
by Mamba X sensored motor controllers.  The motors for the first and second diffusers were
supplied with 26 V DC and 5 and 7 A of current, respectively.  With the diffusers mounted to the
motors, both motors were capable of spinning at 90,000 RPM (≈9400 rad/s).  Due to the high
angular velocity, care was taken to balance the diffuser assembly during machining and shim
stock was used to properly seat the diffuser in the diffuser holder.  Failure to properly balance the
diffusers can cause extreme mechanical vibration which can misalign the optical setup or, at best,
introduce unwanted noise and oscillations in the light intensity imaged by a given pixel.
The laser light was imaged by a Telops Fast-IR 2K high-speed infrared camera which employs
a  cryogenically  cooled  InSb  focal-plane  array  with  320  x  256  pixels.   At  full  resolution,  the
camera is capable of operating at nearly 2000 frames-per-second (FPS). However, during all
LAI experiments the field of view was reduced to 64 x 52 pixels to enable frame rates of 24
kFPS to be used.  This frame rate was required to sufficiently resolve the absorbance spectrum
measured in each pixel when employing the scan rates and amplitudes used here.  A bandpass
filter centered near 2060 cm−1  with a full-width at half-maximum of 40 cm−1  was used to prevent
pixel saturation from background flame emission which was pronounced in the high-temperature
and sooting flame studied here.
Flames were produced by a custom-made coflow burner (see Fig.  1(b)).  The outer body of
the burner is made from a stainless-steel pipe (330 mm long, 19 mm outer diameter) with weld
neck flanges on each end.  A smaller tube (3.2 mm (1/8") outer diameter and 2.16 mm (0.085")
inner diameter) concentric with the outer body of the burner carried a mixture of oxygen and
ethylene to the flame.  Streams of ethylene (0.045 L/min) and oxygen (0.072 L/in) were mixed
≈150 diameters upstream of the burner exit via a mixing T-junction that was connected to 1/4"
diameter gas lines made of 316 stainless steel.  A coflow of air entered the burner orthogonally
through the main outer body 51 mm above the bottom flange.  The air flowed through the annulus
between the body wall and central tube and passed through a 6-cm deep bed of 3-mm diameter
glass beads located 72 mm downstream of the coflow inlet.  The coflow then passed through a
12.7 mm thick honeycomb flow straightener (0.88 mm cell size) at the exit plane to reduce the
turbulence level and lateral velocity components.  The exit of the fuel supply line is flush with the
exit of the honeycomb flow straightener.  To mitigate risk of flashback, the burner was first lit
without coflow and without premixing to establish a pure-ethylene-air diffusion flame.  Once the
diffusion flame was established the flow rate of oxygen was gradually increased until the desired
equivalence ratio was reached.  The C2H4-O2  jet exit velocity and jet Reynolds number were 0.8
m/s and 61.0, respectively.  The coflow velocity was adjusted until the flame appeared steady,
resulting in an approximate exit velocity and Reynolds number of 0.5 m/s and 331.6, respectively.
Figure 1(c) shows the partially premixed (φ=6.43) oxygen-ethylene flame studied here using
LAI. The image shown in Fig.  1(c) was acquired using high dynamic range (HDR) imaging to
highlight flame structure and avoid camera saturation.  This was required due to the extreme
luminosity (too bright to view without eye protection) of this flame.  The HDR images were
acquired using a Nikon D3200 camera with an AF-S Nikkor 18-55 mm lens.  For each HDR
image, 4 photos were taken with varying shutter speeds and then combined with Luminance                                                                        
HDR software to create the final image.  The shutter speed for each image was chosen to be
optimal for a unique region of the flame.
3.    Motivation for optical design
Experiments  were  conducted  without  diffusers  to  illustrate  the  challenges  associated  with
performing  mid-IR  LAI  with  coherent  laser  light.   Without  diffusers,  pronounced  Airy-disk
patterns  were  observed  in  images  of  the  QCL’s  laser  beam  (see  Fig.   2(a)).   These  and  other
diffraction-induced patterns were altered by the presence of the flame and varied in time during
scanned-wavelength  experiments.   For  example,  Fig.   2(b)  illustrates  the  signal  time  history
measured in a single pixel while scanning the wavelength and intensity of the QCL. Pronounced
oscillations  in  signal  intensity  (analogous  to  optical  fringes  formed  by  conventional  etalons)
were found in pixels located in the vicinity of diffraction patterns.  These oscillations severely
complicate in situ determination of the non-absorbing light intensity (Io).  This leads to spatially
dependent errors in the best-fit spectroscopic parameters (e.g., integrated absorbance) obtained
from the spectral-fitting routine, which leads to spatially correlated errors in the measured gas
conditions.  For example, Fig.  2(c) shows a single image of the path-integrated temperature field
(calculated from the two-color ratio of integrated absorbances) that is severely compromised by a
clear Airy-disk pattern in the middle of the flame.
One approach to avoiding these diffraction-induced image artifacts is to destroy the coherence
in the laser light by reflecting the beam off spinning diffusers.  This technique has been used in a
variety of low-speed visible-imaging applications employing laser backlighting [23–25], most
similarly, to perform low-speed (<30 frames per second) imaging of soot-volume-fraction in
flames via 2D imaging of visible (632.8 nm) laser extinction [23].  However, implementing this
strategy into a high-speed scanned-wavelength laser-absorption-spectroscopy technique has, to
our knowledge, never been done previously and this presented several challenges.  Most notably,
high angular velocities (approaching 100,000 RPM) were needed to scramble the speckle pattern
created by the diffusers (see Figs.   3(a) and 3(b)) and sufficiently homogenize the local light
field on the timescale of the short camera integration times required here (order of 10  µs).  For
example, Fig.  3(c) compares single-pixel time histories measured during a scanned-wavelength
experiment with stationary and spinning diffusers.  When the diffusers are stationary the light
field  consists of a  speckle  pattern  (see Fig.   3(a))  and large amplitude,  temporally structured
noise (see Fig.  3(c)) persists in each pixel (albeit with altered characteristics).  The latter likely
originates from wavelength-dependent optical interference.  However, by spinning the diffusers                                                                              
the speckle pattern can be sufficiently homogenized on the timescale of the camera integration
time (see Fig.  3(b)).  This leads to the signal in each pixel consisting of relatively random (i.e.,
unstructured) and lower amplitude noise (see Fig.  3(c)) which is much less problematic for the
spectroscopic fitting routine.  It is worth noting that spinning both diffusers provides only a small
gain in SNR compared to spinning a single diffuser.  However, it was critical to reflect the light
off two diffusers (e.g., 1 stationary, 1 spinning) to achieve an SNR sufficient for 2D LAI in the
flames studied here.   Figure 3(d) illustrates that using a longer camera integration time (tint)
reduces the noise level.  This is because it enables the time-varying speckle pattern to be averaged
over a longer duration.  The measurement of SNR vs integration time was least-squares fit to a
power-law function of the form SNR(tint) = atibnt.  The best-fit values of a and b were 4.82 and
0.51, respectively, and the coefficient of determination (i.e., R2) was 0.999 indicating that the
model captures the effect of integration time on SNR well.  From this analysis, it is clear that
using the highest motor speed and longest integration time possible for a given frame rate is
desirable.
It is important to note that the results shown in Fig.  3 are dependent on the laser wavelength
and diffuser grit size.  Gold-coated ground-glass diffusers with 120, 220, and 1500 grits/inch
were  all  tested.   The  diffusers  with  120  grits/inch  performed  best  (provided  a  diffuse  beam
and dense speckle pattern) when using laser light near 4.8  µm.  Conversely, the diffusers with
1500  grits/inch  performed  best  for  laser  light  near  1.4  µm,  but  performed  poorly  (providing
near-specular reflections with little speckling) for laser light near 4.8  µm.
4.    2D Laser-absorption measurements
4.1.    Validation of LAI diagnostic
The accuracy of the LAI diagnostic was validated by studying a non-reacting, isothermal, laminar
jet  of  49%  CO, 49%  Ar  and  2%  H2  flowing  into  ambient  air.   The  initial  jet diameter  was  2
mm and the exit velocity of the jet was 3.32 m/s, yielding a jet Reynolds number of 217.6.  The
spatial resolution of the LAI diagnostic was estimated by imaging a wire mesh backlit with the
incoherent mid-infrared laser light (see Fig.  4).  The known spacing between wires was used to
determine that the projected pixel size was 140  µm.  In all experiments the camera was focused
onto the central axis of the jet (determined by imaging a wire mesh).  The QCL was scanned
across the P(0,20) transition at 50 Hz and the laser light was imaged at 24 kFPS with a resolution
of 64 x 52 pixels.  The QCL’s current was scanned below the threshold current to enable the
background emission in each pixel to be measured.  The measured background emission was                                                                               
subtracted  from  each  pixel  and  the  baseline  incident  light  intensity  was  then  determined  for
each pixel by least-squares fitting a 3rd-order polynomial to the non-absorbing regions of the
intensity scan.  The absorbance spectrum measured by each pixel (e.g., see Fig.  5(a)) was then
calculated using Beer’s law.  A Voigt profile was least-squares fit to the measured absorbance
spectrum in each pixel with the transition linecenter, integrated absorbance (i.e., integrated area)
and collisional width as free parameters and the Doppler width fixed at the value corresponding
to the known temperature (296 K). With the temperature and pressure known, the integrated
absorbance corresponding to the best-fit Voigt profile was then used to calculate the mole fraction
or column density of CO using Eq.  (1).
Aproj, j  = Sj(T)P χCO L                                               (1)
Here  Aproj, j  [cm−1]  is  the  integrated  absorbance  of  transition   j,  Sj(T)  [cm−2/atm]  is  the
linestrength of transition  j at temperature T, P [atm] is the pressure of the gas,  χCO is the mole
fraction of CO, and L [cm] is the path length through the absorbing gas.  Figure 5(b) shows that
the measured CO mole fraction in the jet core (calculated assuming a constant optical path length
equal to the initial jet diameter) agrees within 3% of the known value (i.e.,  χCO = 0.49) and the
spatial standard deviation in the jet core is 3.1% of the known value.  The image also reveals the
expected structure of a laminar jet, with a near constant mole fraction in the core of the jet and
increasing (in the axial direction) transport of CO into the boundary layer.  Figure 5(c) illustrates
how the measured column density of CO varies across the jet and how it compares to the value
predicted assuming a constant  χCO = 0.49 (i.e., no mixing) and the known initial jet geometry.  At
the jet exit, the measured profile of  χCO L agrees exceptionally well with that predicted assuming
constant  χCO  and  similar  agreement  exists  further  downstream  (y =  4  mm  and  8.5  mm)  in
the middle of the jet (i.e., -0.75 mm < r < 0.75 mm), thereby supporting the accuracy of this
diagnostic.  The 95% confidence interval (obtained from the spectral-fitting routine) of  χCO L
varied between 1% and 3% across the jet.  The radial profiles indicate increasing transport of CO
into the boundary layer and this likely results from a combination of diffusion and laboratory
air  currents,  the  latter  of  which  introduced  an  obvious  asymmetry  in  the  jet  profile  on  other
occasions.
4.2.    Path-integrated measurements of 2D flame structure
2D LAI measurements of path-integrated temperature and CO column density were acquired in
laminar, partially premixed, oxygen-ethylene flames.  Figures 1(b) and 1(c) illustrate the burner
and flame studied, respectively.  The LAI measurements were acquired using a 64 x 52 pixel
window with a frame rate of 24 kFPS and an integration time of 16.4  µs.  Using this exposure
time and a bandpass filter near 2060 cm−1, the flame produced ≈12,000 counts of background
emission, which was measured with the laser off before each scan and then subtracted from each
pixel’s time history prior to calculating the absorbance corresponding to each scan.  Some slight
instabilities in the flame were observed which introduced additional noise in the signal measured
by each pixel.  As a result, multiple scans were averaged together (after background subtraction)
to further improve SNR. Figure 6(a) illustrates how averaging multiple scans together improves
the SNR. Specifically, the scan-averaged SNR improves from 24.7 to 50.4 for 15- and 50-scan
averages,  respectively.   Figure  6(b)  shows  the  corresponding  absorbance  spectrum  (15-scan
average) measured by a single pixel imaging the middle of the flame.  The absorbance spectrum
exhibits a 1-σ absorbance noise level of 0.008.  For each spectrum, the transition lineshapes were
modeled by a Voigt profile and the best-fit spectrum was determined using a least-squares fitting
routine with the transition linecenters, integrated absorbances, and collisional widths as free
parameters.  The Doppler width of each transition was fixed to the value given by the temperature
determined from the two-color ratio of integrated absorbance,  R (given by Eq.  (2)), obtained
from the previous iteration.
Here,  Aproj,P(0,20)  and  Aproj,P(1,14)  are the integrated absorbance of the P(0,20) and P(1,14)
absorption  transitions  determined  by  the  spectral-fitting  routine.   With  R and  spectroscopic
constants known, the path-integrated temperature was determined using Eq.  (3) [26]:
where h [J · s] is Planck’s constant, c [cm/s] is the speed of light, kB [J/K] is the Boltzmann
constant, E′′  [cm−1] is the lower-state energy of a given transition (taken from the HITRAN2012
Database [27]), and To is the reference temperature (296 K). Here subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the
P(1,14) and P(0,20) transitions, respectively.
With the pressure and path-integrated temperature known, the integrated absorbance of the
P(0,20) transition was used to calculate the column density of CO ( χCO L) using Eq.  (1) where the
linestrength of the P(0,20) transition was evaluated at the measured path-integrated temperature
using Eq.  (4).
Here, νo is the transition linecenter frequency [cm−1] and Q is the partition function.  It should
be noted that this approach is strictly valid in the limit that the linestrength of each transition
exhibits a linear dependence on temperature across the range of temperatures that exist along the
line-of-sight [13].
Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show images of path-integrated flame temperature for a 15- and 50-scan
average, respectively, and Figures 7(c) and 7(d) show images of CO column density for a 15-
and 50-scan average, respectively.  The spectral-fitting routine was performed in all pixels where
the peak absorbance on the P(0,20) transition was greater than 0.05,  thereby ignoring pixels
with  an  absorbance  SNR  lower  than  6.25.   The  images  illustrate  that  2D  LAI  is  capable  of
resolving the thermochemical structure of laboratory scale laminar flames.  The images reveal
that the temperature is lowest in the fuel-rich core near the burner exit and increases in both the
radial and axial directions, and peaks near the boundary with the air coflow.  These observations
are  consistent  with  the  expected  structure  of  a  laminar  diffusion  flame.    The  image  of  CO
column density is more difficult to interpret given that the flame diameter increases in the flow
direction.  Regardless, these images illustrate that, in general, the amount of CO present along a
given line-of-sight increases in the flow direction.  All of the images indicate that the flame is
approximately axisymmetric, thereby enabling a tomographic reconstruction to be performed to
provide greater detail regarding the 2D flame structure.
Tomographic reconstruction of 2D flame structure
Figure 8 shows tomographic reconstructions of gas temperature and CO mole fraction in the
flame’s radial plane for a 5-scan (Figs.  8(a) and 8(c)) and 50-scan (Figs.  8(b) and 8(d)) average.
Radial  profiles  of  temperature  and  CO  mole  fraction  are  shown  in  Fig.   8(e)  at  select  axial
locations to further illustrate the thermochemical flame structure.  These results were obtained
by applying the  tomographic reconstruction algorithms  developed by Daun et al.  [28] to  the
path-integrated measurements of integrated absorbance obtained via LAI. These alogrithms have
previously been applied to numerous flame studies [14, 19, 21].  The results shown in Fig.  8 more
clearly reveal the flame structure (compared to path-integrated results) and illustrate temperature
and species profiles that are consistent with that expected in a fuel rich, partially premixed flame.
The temperature is lowest in the core of the flame and, in general, increases in both the axial and
radial directions.  In comparison to the images of path-integrated temperature, the tomographic
reconstruction reveals that the temperature rise in the axial direction within the flame core is
more modest, increasing from 740 K to 1320 K between 1 mm and 9 mm above the burner exit,
respectively.  The temperature is highest (reaching a maximum near 2200 K) near the boundary
between the fuel-rich C2H4/O2  stream and air coflow where oxygen supplied by the coflow can
reach the unburnt fuel and intermediate species.  The reconstructions illustrate that very little CO
is present near the burner exit and that the mole fraction of CO increases significantly in both the
axial and radial directions before falling off in the boundary layer.
The remainder of this section is devoted to describing the pertinent details of the tomographic
reconstructions.  Tomographic reconstructions were performed assuming each pixel images a
unique line-of-sight.  Flame-induced beam steering could cause this assumption to breakdown
and ultimately reduce the spatial resolution of the diagnostic.  Since tomographic reconstruction
is sensitive to noise in the input image, a 2×2-pixel average was applied to all images prior to                                                                                 
averaging 5, or 50 measured spectra together (i.e., prior to performing time averaging).  This
significantly  reduced  the  noise  induced  by  beam  steering  and  the  rotating  diffusers.    Next,
the absorbance spectra were processed using a two-line Voigt fit,  as described previously,  to
determine the integrated absorbance (Aproj) of the P(0,20) and P(1,14) absorption transitions
corresponding to each pixel.  The tomographic reconstruction algorithm employed here relies on
assuming that the flame is axisymmetric.  As a result,  Aproj  only needs to be resolved along the
flame radius.  Since  Aproj  was measured here along both halves of the flame, the results for each
half were simply averaged together, however it should be noted that this has a small effect on
image quality (see Fig.  9).  The image (i.e., matrix) of each transition’s integrated absorbance
was then passed to the tomographic reconstruction algorithm as described next.
The  tomographic  reconstruction  algorithm  requires  the  assumption  that  the  flame  can  be
divided into N concentric rings of thickness Δr with a homogeneously distributed field variable,
k, which is given by Eq.  (5) for a specific absorption transition.
k = Sj(T)P χCO                                                                 (5)
k effectively represents the local integrated absorbance per unit path length and the integral of k
along a line-of-sight represents the back-projected data (i.e., the measured integrated absorbance:
Aproj).  N is given by the number of pixels that resolve the flame radius and Δr is given by the
projected pixel size.                                                                                    
First, a process called onion-peeling deconvolution is used to generate a set of equations of the
form  Ax = b.  Here,  A is the coefficient matrix which contains the path length of light through
each annular section (i.e., the absorbing path length of the line-of-sight imaged by a given pixel)
and is given by Eq.  (6),  x contains the to-be-solved-for field variable (k), and  b contains the
back-projected data (i.e., the integrated absorbance,  Aproj, measured by each pixel).
Solving  this  system  with  back  substitution  may  return  a  solution  that  is  sensitive  to  noise  in
the back-projected data which manifests as errors or noise in the reconstruction of  k.  This is
because onion-peeling deconvolution yields an ill-conditioned coefficient matrix which makes it
difficult to find a well defined global minimum [28].  To overcome this, Tikhonov regularization
is employed to increase the condition of the matrix [28].  In doing so, the equations shown below
are used to provide a more robust solution.
Here, k˜∗  is the field variable that yields the global minimum residual after Tikhonov regularization
(i.e., the solution that is ultimately used to calculate images of gas properties).  For the zeroth
order regularization used for the data presented in this manuscript,  L0  is given by the  N × N
matrix shown in Eq.  (10).
The  parameter  α0  is  called  the  regularization  parameter  and  it  controls  the  balance  between
solution accuracy and smoothness/stability [28].  This works by approximating solutions to the
ill-conditioned set of equations with those of a similar well-conditioned set.  A high value of
α0  will return a solution which is smooth, but less faithful to the original problem, and lower
values return high-fidelity but often oscillatory solutions.  As α0  → 0, k˜∗  →  k∗  where k∗  is the
field variable that yields the true minimum residual.  Although methods exist for determining
an  optimum  value  for  α0  [29],  the  value  is  often  chosen  at  the  user’s  discretion  to  obtain  an
acceptable balance of accuracy and smoothness [28].  Figure 9 illustrates how increasing α0  from
0 to 1 improves image quality but reduces spatial resolution.  In addition, Fig.  9 also illustrates                                                                                    
how averaging both halves of the absorbance data together (prior to reconstruction) and using
a 2x2 pixel average both slightly improve image quality without significantly altering the final
images of  χCO.  The images presented in Fig.  8 were obtained using α0  = 0.1 since this produced
solutions with acceptable stability while preserving the vast majority of flame structure that was
revealed using α0  = 0.
The  solution  for  each  individual  transverse  plane  (i.e.,  row  of  pixels)  was  stable,  however
differences between adjacent planes gave the final 2D images a somewhat noisy appearance.  This
noise was attenuated by applying a 6-point moving average filter along the axial direction of the
2D images of k˜∗  for each absorption transition.  Figure 10 illustrates the row-to-row oscillations
in k˜∗  for both absorption transitions near the flame’s central axis and how the 6-point moving
average is effective at removing the oscillations while preserving flame structure.
After reconstructing the 2D image of k˜∗  for each absorption transition, the two-color ratio of
k˜∗, Rk˜∗ , was calculated using Eq.  (11).
The final 2D image of temperature was obtained by replacing R with Rk˜∗   in Eq.  (3).  Next, the
2D image of  χCO was obtained using Eq.  (5) with k replaced by k˜∗P(0,20)  and using the 2D image
of temperature to calculate the corresponding image of the P(0,20) transition’s linestrength.
The SNR of the measured absorbance for the P(1,14) transition is low in the center of the flame
near the exit of the burner since the gas is relatively cool and little CO is present there.  This
prevented a reliable reconstruction of the 2D temperature field in a 1.7 mm wide region located
0 to 3 mm above the burner exit.  As a result, 224 pixels of the temperature data in this region
were replaced with values extrapolated from a 2nd-order polynomial which was obtained via
least-squares fitting to the remainder of the data set.  A total of 224, or 6.7% of the temperature
image presents a value that was obtained via extrapolation.
Conclusion
This work has demonstrated, for the first time, that mid-infrared LAI is capable of providing 2D
measurements and tomographic reconstructions of flame temperature and carbon monoxide in
axisymmetric flames without mechanical translation of the line-of-sight.  This was achieved by
reflecting scanned-wavelength laser light off two ground-glass diffusers spinning at 90,000 RPM
prior to the light traversing the flame.  This was done to break the coherence in the laser light
and, therefore, prevent the formation of diffraction-induced image artifacts which have limited
previously developed LAI techniques to 1D (simultaneously) imaging.  Ultimately this approach
enabled  measurements  of  CO’s  absorbance  spectra  to  be  acquired  at  50  Hz  across  ≈3,300
lines-of-sight simultaneously.  While additional time averaging of spectra was done to improve
the  final  image  quality,  this  work  demonstrated  that  this  technique  can  provide  high-fidelity
2D measurements and tomographic reconstructions of temperature and CO mole fraction on
near-cm scales with a projected pixel size of 140  µm and a time resolution of 0.1 to 1 seconds.
In comparison to conventional mid-IR LAT techniques employing mechanical translation of the
line-of-sight, this technique offers a reduction in data collection time of ≈1,000× and potential
for a ≈10× gain in spatial resolution compared to LAT methods that are limited by the laser beam
diameter.  In short, the capabilities of this 2D mid-IR LAI technique represent a significant step
towards achieving high-speed, high-resolution measurements of thermochemical flame structure
via LAT.

CFD simulation of gas每solid bubbling fluidized bed: an extensive assessment of drag models 
Abstract 
In the computational fluid dynamics modeling of gas每solid two phase flow, drag force is one of the dominant mechanisms for interphase momentum transfer. Despite the profusion of drag models, an extensive comparison is missing from the literature. In this work the drag correlations of Syamlal-O＊Brien, Gidaspow, Wen-Yu, Arastoopour, Gibilaro, Di Felice, Zhang-Reese and Koch et al. are reviewed using a multifluid model of FLUENT software with the resulting hydrodynamics parameters being compared with experimental data. Also adjustment of drag models based on minimum fluidization was studied. A new method adopted to adjust the drag function of Di Felice showed a quantitative improvement compared to the adjusted drag model of Syamlal-O＊Brien. Prediction of bed expansion and pressure drop showed excellent agreement with results of experiments conducted in a Plexiglas fluidized bed. A mesh size sensitivity analysis with varied interval spacing showed that mesh interval spacing with 18 times the particle diameter and using higher order discretization methods produces acceptable results. 
Keywords:  multiphase flow, fluidization, computation, modeling, CFD, drag models, two-dimensional. 
1 Introduction 
Studies conducted on the dynamics of a single particle in a fluid have proven several mechanisms of momentum transfer between phases: drag force, caused by velocity differences between the phases; buoyancy, caused by the fluid pressure gradient; virtual mass effect, caused by relative acceleration between phases; Saffman lift force, caused by fluid-velocity gradients; Magnus force, caused by particle spin; Basset force, which depends upon the history of the particle＊s motion through the fluid; Faxen force, which is a correction applied to the virtual mass effect; Basset force to account for fluid velocity gradients; and forces caused by temperature and density gradients [1]. Several factors should be considered in extension of single particle model to describe interaction forces in multi-particle systems, including the effect of the proximity of other particles, which implies that the drag force is a function of solid volume fraction, in addition to the particle Reynolds number. Also the single-particle interaction force must be corrected to account for the effect of mass transfer between the phases, and the momentum transfer accompanying such mass transfer must be included in the interaction force. Buoyancy, drag, and momentum transfer due to mass transfer have been considered as controlling mechanisms of gas每solid momentum transfer, since they are the dominant forces as a result of the large density difference between the particles and the fluidizing gas and also due to lack of satisfactory formulations of the other forces. Whilst the inherent instabilities due to inclusion of buoyancy are still not resolved, prediction of a drag model that covers the whole range of Reynolds number and phasic volume fraction has been looked at as the main challenge of numerous of the studies in multiphase flow modeling [2]. These attempts have resulted in the appearance of a substantial number of drag correlations in the literature.  
The copiousness of drag models available in the literature and the selective attitudes of some researchers have resulted in some inconsistencies regarding the appropriate comparison of available drag models. Almost all the available studies have included efforts to compare two, or at most three, drag correlations, and occasionally the discrepancies between the reported results in modeling fluidization hydrodynamics are easily observed. In this respect, the underlying objective of this study is to accomplish an extensive assessment of frequently used drag correlations in a large selection of published literature and provide a comprehensive comparison between simulation and experimental results using the variety of the drag models. Also, a new approach to adjust the drag model, based on minimum fluidization velocity, is proposed and compared with experimental values. CFD simulation was carried out using the commercial CFD code, FLUENT.  
2 Model equations 
The drag force depends on the local relative velocity between phases and void fraction and some other factors, such as particle size distribution, particle shape, etc. However, void fraction dependency is very difficult to be determined for any conditions other than a packed bed or infinite dilution (single particle). Also, some factors, like particle size distribution, particle shape, and particle clustering have not been considered in deriving drag correlations.  In an ideal case, it could only be determined how the drag for specific material varies with local ※slip§ velocity and packing, although, totally unrealistic. On the other hand, most researchers have information on the minimum fluidization velocity of their own material.  In this respect, Syamlal and O＊Brien [3] introduced a method to adjust drag law using minimum fluidization velocity as a calibration point. This adjustment has been introduced in order to make the drag law more accurate for a specific system under study. However, this method requires measurement of the minimum fluidization velocity and void fraction of the bed at minimum fluidization velocity by means of experimentation. As another alternative based on the same concept used by Syamlal and O＊Brien [3], we developed the following method to adjust the Di Felice drag model. Di Felice [4] expressed the drag coefficient model as the product of drag force on an unhindered particle subjected to the same volumetric flux of fluid and a voidage function: 
where f (汐)  is defined as 
and the empirical coefficient (x) as a function of Res is expressed as 
In the absence of gas-wall friction and solid stress transmitted by the particles, the momentum balance at minimum fluidization can be written as follows [5]: 
Buoyancy = Drag 
At the minimum fluidization velocity, considering that
Plugging the drag model into Equation (7) and utilizing a nonlinear optimization algorithm the drag model parameters P & Q in Equation (3) can be adjusted for the system under study using experimental data at minimum fluidization velocity. However, when adjusting the drag models it should be kept in mind that the adjustment should not alter the behavior of the drag correlation when voidage approaches 1. Most drag correlations are formulated such that in that limit, the single sphere CD can be recovered. 
3 Experimental set-up 
The experimental set-up used in this study has been shown in fig. 1. Experiments were carried out in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of British Columbia. The Column is a 2D Plexiglas of 1.2 m height, 0.28 m width, and 0.025 m thickness. Spherical glass beads of 250每300 米m diameter and density 2500 kg/m3 were fluidized with air at ambient conditions. Pressure drops were measured using three differential pressure transducers located at elevation 0.03, 0.3, and 0.6 m above the gas distributor, respectively. The static bed height of 0.4 m with a solid volume fraction of 0.6 was used in all the experiments. Pressure drop and bed expansion were monitored at different superficial gas velocities ranging from 0 to 0.8 (m/s).  
Figure 1: Geometry of 2D Plexiglas fluidized bed. 
4 Simulation set-up 
The two-dimensional (2D) geometry was discretized using 13440 structured rectangular cells. Performing a grid size sensitivity analysis using different mesh sizes, 5 mm mesh interval spacing was chosen for all the simulation runs. The discussion on the effect of the different mesh sizes has been brought up in a later section.  A preliminary case study proved that using fixed time step; in order of magnitude 10-3, which has been reported in literature, is not sufficient to avoid the instability in convergence for 2D multiphase simulations. Therefore, an adaptive time-stepping algorithm with 100 iterations per each time step was used to ensure a stable convergence. The automatic determination of the time step size is based on the estimation of the truncation error associated with the time integration scheme (i.e., first-order implicit or second-order implicit). If the truncation error is smaller than a specified tolerance, the size of the time step is increased; if the truncation error is greater, the time step size is decreased.  A minimum value of order 10-5 was used for the lower domain of time step. A convergence tolerance of 10-4 for each scaled residual component was specified for the relative error between two successive iterations. The governing equations were solved using the finite volume method. The Phase-Coupled SIMPLE algorithm (PC-SIMPLE) [6], which is an extension of the SIMPLE algorithm to multiphase flow, was applied for the pressure-velocity coupling. In this algorithm, the velocities are solved, coupled by phases, in a segregated fashion. Subsequently, the block algebraic multigrid scheme used by the couple solver was used to solve the equation formed by the velocity components of phases at the same time. Also, a pressure correction equation is built based on total volume continuity. Pressure and velocities are then corrected so as to satisfy the continuity constraint. Second-order upwind discretization schemes were used for all the simulation runs. Including the adjusted drag model cases, 9 drag correlations in total, were studied in this work (i.e., Arastoopour, Di Felice, Gibilaro, Gidaspow, Syamlal-O＊Brien, Wen-Yu, Zhang-Reese, Koch et al.). FLUENT employed an approximate CPU time of 32 hours for 30 s of real-time simulation at a mean time step of 0.0005 s on a double core Sun Microsystems workstation W2100Z with 2 AMD/Opteron 64-bit processors and 4 GB RAM. 
5 Results and discussion 
Experimental runs were conducted to measure the pressure drop and bed expansion ratio, H/H0, at different superficial gas velocities. The gas-phase volume fraction from pressure drop measurement across the bed was obtained [7]. At experimentally determined minimum fluidization velocity, Umf = 0.065 m/s, the overall pressure drop, bed expansion ratio, and voidage found to be 4.4 KPa, 1.1, and 0.5, respectively. A wide range of gas superficial velocity (0.011-0.75 m/sec) was considered to measure these parameters. The CFD simulations were carried out using the transient Eulerian-granular model in FLUENT v6.3. Several superficial gas velocities, 0.11, 0.21, 0.38, and 0.46 m/s, which correspond to 1.6, 3.2, 5.8, and 7Umf, respectively studied.  
 The drag coefficient values as a function of solid volume fraction for different drag models are plotted in Fig. 2. All the drag functions show a rising trend of drag coefficient value with increasing the solid volume fraction. The values of drag coefficients were calculated at a typical Reynolds number, Res =10. At low volume fraction of solids (<0.18), excluding the Syamlal-O＊Brien adjusted model, which overestimated and the Arastoopour function, which slightly underestimated the drag coefficient values, all the drag models represent almost the same value of drag function. Also, it should be noted that at the limit of extremely dilute suspension all the drag models approach the single particle drag value. For the values of solid volume fraction above 0.2, the Di Felice adjusted model precipitously separates from the other model toward the higher values of drag coefficient. This trend continues until it crosses the Syamlal-O＊Brien adjusted drag model at the value of solid void fraction equal to 0.46.  From this point on, Di Felice adjusted model gives the highest values of the drag coefficient. With the exception of the Syamlal-O＊Brien adjusted drag model which shows an decreasing trend regarding the slope of the curve for values of solid volume fraction greater than 0.14, all other models show an approximately constant slope (i.e. linear growth in drag coefficient value). It is also noted that the differences among the drag models mainly occur when the solid volume fraction is higher than 0.2. The graph also reveals that adjustment of drag models based on minimum fluidization velocity results in the prediction of higher values of drag coefficient through the whole range of solid volume fraction.

5.1 Bed expansion 
Fluctuation and vigorous motion of the bed surface in fluidized beds have made the determination of bed expansion by visual observation a challenging task. The general method employed to determine the bed expansion is normally based on the bed voidage measurement, which in turn is deduced from the mean pressure drop [8]. Also, bed height has been measured experimentally by means of the overhead observation of a probe tip. Such measurement has been believed to be highly biased, and, more importantly, no standard errors or deviations of data have been reported [8]. Fryer and Potter [9] reported that the experimental technique might well underestimate the bed expansion due to the diffusing characteristic of the bed surface. The other frequently employed method is to plot the time-mean gauge pressure (single-point pressure) against the height of the pressure transducer taps, where the intersection of the two slopes corresponds to the height of the expanded bed. However, this method requires an adequate number of pressure transducers at different elevations along the bed and freeboard [10]. In case of a limited number of pressure transducers, Ellis [10], using the time-mean differential pressure drop data across a certain interval inside the dense bed and across another section extending from the lowest pressure tap to a tap in the freeboard, adopted the following correlation to estimate the expanded bed height: 
However, due to the fact that this technique relies on a single pressure drop measurement inside the bed, one should be more cautious about the accuracy of data rather than the method based on the gauge pressure measurement profile.  To determine the bed expansion, from modeling perspective, we considered the height of the bed that contains 95% of the bed weight as the bed height. The results of this method, as reported by Syamlal and O＊Brien [8], are not sensitive to the percent bed-weight value chosen within a small range, due to the fact that most of the time, experimental values are reported as bed expansion percent rather than as actual bed height. For this series of simulations, a static bed height of H0=0.4 m over a range of superficial velocities 11.7, 21, 38, and 46 cm/s was used. All the simulations show the correct qualitative behavior of bed expansion. Ascending trend of bed expansion with increasing superficial gas velocity can be observed from the graph (fig. 3). Also, all the available drag correlations with the exception of two adjusted drag models (i.e. Di Felice and Syamlal-O＊Brien) and the original Di Felice drag model at high superficial gas velocity (0.46 m/s), underestimate the bed expansion. 
Figure 3: Comparison of simulated bed expansion ratio with experiment data. 
5.2 Pressure drop 
In order to eliminate the large temporal fluctuation of pressure drop in the early seconds of the simulation, the time-average of pressure drop for comparing simulation and experimental results were taken after statistical steady state was established. Numerical results for all the models showed that 3 s of simulation is adequate to reach statistical steady state behavior. Time-averaging was carried out over a range of 4-20 s of real time simulation.  As indicated in Fig. 4, the pressure drop inside the bed between two specific elevations (i.e. 0.03 m and 0.3 m as demonstrated in Fig. 1) for all the models showed a declining trend with increase of the superficial gas velocity, which is in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data.Here again, two adjusted drag models (i.e. Di Felice and Syamlal-O＊Brien) showed their superiority in predicting the pressure drop inside the bed. At higher gas velocities, 7Umf, deviation from reported experimental data was observed, which may be explained by the underestimation of the effect of particle clustering at high superficial gas velocities and the influence of the gas distributor at higher velocities. 
Figure 4: Pressure drop inside the bed (.P = P . P ).
5.3 Grid size sensitivity analysis 
To study the effect of mesh size resolution on numerical results, a grid size sensitivity analysis was carried out using three distinctive mesh intervals spacing of 5 mm, 4 mm, and 2 mm for 20 seconds of real-time simulation. The results indicate that the grid size spacing selected for simulation in this work (i.e. 5 mm) was adequate for satisfactory prediction of the hydrodynamics in computational geometry. On the other hand, the results did not support the previously proposed criteria (i.e. adequacy of mesh size less than or equal to 10 times the particle diameter) in the literature, [8,11], for CFD simulation of fluidized beds. Table 1 compares the time required for 20 s of real-time simulation. Required time for simulating 20 seconds of 2D fluidized bed drastically increases from 32 hr to almost one week for a decrease in grid interval spacing from 5 mm to 2 mm, respectively. 
Table 1: Grid size sensitivity results. 
Mesh spacing (mm)  .P1 (kPa)  .P2 (kPa)  Voidage  Simulation time (hr)  
2mm  3.36  5.50  0.55  168  
4mm  3.38  5.37  0.54  80  
5mm  3.39  5.39  0.54  32  
6 Conclusion 
The influence of most widely used drag functions, including the Wen-Yu, Gidaspow, Di Felice, Syamlal-O＊Brien, Zhang-Reese, Arastoopour, Gibilaro, Koch et al. models, on CFD simulation of a 2D fluidized bed using FLUENT software was studied. All the models showed an acceptable qualitative agreement with the experimental data. Also, adjustment of drag models based on minimum fluidization velocity showed a quantitative improvement in prediction of hydrodynamics parameters. In this respect, the new method of adjustment based on minimum fluidization velocity in absence of gas-wall friction and solid stress transmission applied on the Di Felice drag model showed excellent agreement with experimental results regarding the prediction of bed expansion and pressure drop inside the bed. The mesh size sensitivity analysis carried out in this study demonstrated that even grid interval spacing of 18 times of the particle size (i.e. 275 米m) was able to give acceptable results which is contradictory with some other mesh size sensitivity analyses reported in the literature. However, further modeling efforts are required to study the influence of other parameters such as gas distributors, which have not been studied; comparison of 2D and 3D modeling of fluidized bed reactors and also, effect of particle size distribution which has been underestimated using the mean particle diameter. Moreover, new experimental studies should be carried out using recent advancements in instrumentation engineering in order to resolve the available experimental discrepancies reported in the literature such as void fraction measurements, bed expansion ratio etc.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to characterize the swirling secondary flow in the downstream of a pipe bend using a numerical simulation of the flow. The CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software OpenFOAM is used to simulate the turbulent flow in pipes with elbow. Various turbulence models are benchmarked with the existing experimental data and a comparative study is performed to select an appropriate turbulence model for the analysis. Predictions made by the selected turbulence model are compared with the LDA (Laser Doppler anemometer) measurements from the experiments currently conducted to find the dependency of the flows on the Reynolds number. It is found that the swirl intensity of the secondary flow is a strong function of the radius of curvature of the bend and a weak function of the Reynolds number. Additionally, it is found that the dissipation of the swirl intensity is exponential in nature. 
Keywords: secondary flow, 90-degree bent elbow, swirl intensity, CFD 
1. INTRODUCTION 
A 90-degree-bent elbow is commonly used in many piping systems to connect different components. It is well known that during the flow of fluid in a pipe with elbow, a secondary motion of the flow is developed and it is superimposed on its primary streamwise flow. The secondary flow is generated due to an imbalance between centrifugal force and pressure gradient near the bent-pipe wall in the radial direction of the bend curvature. In general, the structure of the secondary flow is dependent on the radius of the bend curvature (Rc) and Reynolds number (Re) based on the pipe diameter (D) and bulk velocity (Ub). When the non-dimensional radius of curvature of the bend is greater than 1.5 (i.e. Rc/D > 1.5), the secondary flow consisting of a pair of counter-rotating vortices are generated. At the same time, the velocity profile of the primary streamwise flow is distorted and shifted away from the center of the curvature of the elbow. If Rc/D is smaller than 1.5, the flow becomes unsteady because of a flow separation occurring immediately downstream of the bend (Weske, 1948; Hellstrom et al., 2011). The flow in the downstream region of a 90-degree bend is important for the primary and secondary cooling systems of nuclear power plants, where many bends are used to interconnect the components. The distortion in the streamwise velocity profile of the coolant by an elbow can affect the distribution of heat transfer rates. In the case of a bubbly two-phase flow which may occur during an accident in a nuclear power plant, the distribution of the bubbles in the pipe with an elbow is very different compared to that in a pipe without an elbow. Due to the inherent difference in density of the two phases, the gas bubbles are driven toward the centers of the two counter-rotating swirls generated by the elbow (Yadav, 2013). This accumulation of bubbles can increase the possibility of a bubble collision and subsequently alter the interfacial heat and mass transfers. Furthermore, when the curvature radius of an elbow is small enough to create a fluctuating flow after the elbow, the downstream pipe can undergo oscillating mechanical stress, which can lead to structural fatigue in the piping system (Yamano et al., 2009). In the past, several researchers have investigated turbulent flows in pipes with elbows by means of theoretical, experimental, and numerical methods. Weske (1948) experimentally investigated the velocity distribution at the outlet of elbows with various shapes of cross-sections including round, elliptical, square, and rectangular cross sections at

Reynolds numbers ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 ¡Á 106 for the design of an aircraft duct. Sudo et al. (1998) performed the experiments for turbulent flow in a 90-degree-bent pipe with Rc/D = 2. The study used a hot-wire anemometer to measure streamwise velocity (Us) and circumferential velocity (Uc) for a turbulent flow with Reynolds number of 60,000. Al-Rafai et al. (1990) performed an experimental and numerical study of a turbulent air flow in circular pipe bends to investigate the influence of Rc/D on the flow. During the experiments, two bends with Rc/D = 
3.49 and Rc/D = 6.975 were used, and the flow had the Reynolds number of 34,132. Homicz (2004) performed numerical simulations of the flow through a 90-degree elbow with a Rc/D =1.4 at a Reynolds number of 5.4¡Á105 to validate the Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC) test conducted by Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI). These simulations and FAC tests are used to better characterize the flow-accelerated corrosion/erosion in the pipe elbows. More recently, Tanaka et al. (2009) applied a large eddy simulation (LES) approach using a standard Smagorinsky model with a wall function law for flows in elbows with various Rc/D at several Reynolds number conditions. Most of the above-mentioned studies focused only on the flow structure in the immediate vicinity of the elbow and only a limited number of studies investigated the flow in the downstream region of the elbows (Sudo et al., 1998; Al-Rafai et Al., 1990). The knowledge of the flow structure in the downstream region of the elbow is of significant importance to understand the dissipation characteristics of the secondary flow and to accurately assess the development of the flow structure. Additionally, an understanding of the dissipation characteristics is important in evaluating the length required for the elbow effects to be dissipated and in modeling the effects associated with flow restrictions. In view of the above, the objectives of the current study are to perform experimental and numerical studies on turbulent pipe flows after 90-degree elbows and to characterize the secondary flows induced by the 90-degree elbows including the dissipation characteristics. In order for that, it is necessary to choose an appropriate turbulence model specifically for the turbulent flow in a pipe with an elbow. Unexpectedly, there are few papers which are devoted to a numerical study of the turbulent pipe flow through an elbow. In this study, a quantitative assessment method based on hit rate using the experimental data of Sudo et al. (1998) is applied to choose an appropriate turbulence model among the available turbulence models in OpenFOAM CFD code. 

2. EXPERIMENTAL FACILITY AND MEASUREMENT 
As mentioned above, the flow structure after an elbow depends on the Reynolds number and bend curvature. An experiment is conducted to evaluate its dependency on the Reynolds number. 

Fig. 1 Experimental facility and locations of LDA measurement. 
A schematic diagram of the experimental setup, as well as the co-ordinate system used for the current study, is shown in Fig. 1. The detailed description of the test facility is presented in previous studies (Yadav, 2013) and only characteristic features of the test facility are presented here. The experimental facility consists of both upstream and downstream sections constructed from 50.8mm inner diameter (D) acrylic pipes and interconnected by a 90¡ã glass elbow. The elbow has a radius of curvature of 152.4mm (3D), and the lengths of the upstream and downstream sections are 3.35m (L/D = 66) and 9.1m (L/D = 180), respectively. A laser leveling system and a digital level are employed to ensure the alignment of both the upstream and downstream sections within ¡À0.1¡ã. The flow rate for the experiments is measured by an electromagnetic flow meter, with an accuracy of ¡À0.5% of the full-scale reading.

An integrated Laser Doppler anemometer (LDA), which is capable of one-dimensional velocity measurements, is used to measure the axial water velocity. The light beam in the LDA is generated by 35 mW laser with a wavelength of 600 nm. The principal characteristics of the LDA are listed in Table 1. It should be noted that due to the difference in the refractive index of air, acrylic, and water, the LDA measurement volume inside the pipe is shifted by a finite amount. This shift is 
accounted for by employing Snell¡®s law. The 
tracking/seeding particles consist of Polyamide particles with a size distribution of around 20¦Ìm and specific gravity of 1.04. To ensure the statistical reliability of the measurements, a minimum of 5000 samples are measured at each local point and the validation of the burst signals was above 98%. As indicated in Fig. 1, the measurements are performed at 13D upstream of the elbow (53D from inlet) to figure out a fully-developed velocity profile and 3.5D, 10D, and 50D downstream of the elbow in the downstream section. The LDA is mounted on a two-dimensional traversing system, which has a resolution of 1¦Ìm in both traversing directions. This traversing system is further attached to a plate, which is designed with mounting holes at every 22.5¡ã in the azimuthal direction. As such, the LDA along with the traversing system can be attached to the mounting plate to measure the velocity across entire pipe cross-section. Along each azimuthal direction, the LDA is traversed to obtain measurements at 23 radial positions. These radial positions are selected such that a finer measurement mesh is obtained in the near wall region, where a higher velocity gradient is expected.

A total of three flow conditions, as shown in Table 2, are investigated in the current study. These flow conditions are selected to study the effect of increasing Reynolds number on the velocity profiles. It is expected that the swirl intensity and its decay characteristic in a pipe with a 90-degree bend are dependent on Reynolds number of flow and curvature radius of the bend. To evaluate the dependencies, the experiment of Sudo et al. (1998) was referenced. In their experiment, a bend with a curvature radius of 2D was used, and the flow velocity was measured at a Reynolds number of 60000 based on the pipe diameter and bulk velocity. The experimental facility used in this study is equipped with an elbow of 3D curvature radius. The test condition of Run1 is chosen with a bulk velocity of 1 m/s to obtain a similar Reynolds number. The experiment of Sudo et al. (1998) and Run1 in the present experiments were conducted at a similar Reynolds number with different curvature radii of 2D and 3D, respectively. The conditions of other tests, Run 2 and Run 3, are chosen by doubling the bulk velocity to scrutinize the effect of the Reynolds number. 
3. NUMERICAL  SIMULATION  OF  
TURBULENT FLOWS  IN  90-DEGREE- 
BENT PIPE  

The turbulent flow in a 90-degree-bent pipe is complicated by the secondary flow, which is generated by an imbalance of the centrifugal force and pressure gradient in the radial direction of the bend curvature. Additionally, the streamwise flow is distorted by the existence of adverse pressure gradient along the convex wall of the pipe bend. These make an accurate numerical simulation of the flow difficult, especially for turbulent flows with high Reynolds number. To select an appropriate turbulence model for the numerical simulation of a turbulent flow in a pipe with an elbow, validation of the numerical results from turbulence models is very important. In the current study, the experiments conducted by Sudo et al. (1998) on the turbulent flows in a bent pipe are used to validate the turbulence models. In addition, the selection criteria which involve a quantitative assessment are used to perform a comparative study among the tested turbulence models. The selected turbulence model is then used for evaluation of swirl characteristics in the downstream of an elbow. 

3.1 Numerical simulation of Sudo et al.¡¯s experiment 

3.1.1 Test conditions and numerical simulation 
Sudo et al. (1998) performed experiments for turbulent flow in a 90-degree-bent pipe with Rc/D = 2. A straight pipe-section with 100D of development length was installed in the upstream of the bend to provide a fully developed turbulent flow to the bend. The experiments were performed with air as the working fluid and flow Reynolds number Re = 60000. The study used a hot-wire anemometer to measure the streamwise velocity (US) and circumferential velocity (UC) at several locations along the pipe.   The open source CFD code OpenFOAM (OpenCFD, 2012) is used to simulate Sudo et al.¡®s experiments. OpenFOAM solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations discretized in the context of the cell-centered finite volume method (FVM). Numerical solutions are iteratively sought by pressure correction method named SIMPLE algorithm. The standard k-¦Å turbulence model is applied to choose a suitable convective scheme and under-relaxation parameters of the discretized equations. The computational domain is composed of an upstream pipe with 20D length and a downstream pipe with 50D length connected to an elbow as shown in Fig. 2. The boundary conditions at pipe inlet are set as follows: Velocity is fixed with a fully developed power-law profile which is from the experimental data of Zagarola and Smits (1999) for fully developed turbulence pipe flow. The values of the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate are calculated from the inlet turbulence intensity (5% of inlet bulk velocity in this study) and pipe diameter. 


Fig. 2 Computational geometry for simulation of 90o-bent pipe flow. 

Fig. 3 Computational mesh near pipe exit. 
The mesh for the bent pipe is generated by stacking a two-dimensional unstructured mesh of pipe cross-section along the streamwise direction to minimize the non-orthogonality of the mesh. The two-dimensional unstructured mesh of the pipe cross-section is constructed with quadrilateral cells. The constructed mesh of the bent pipe is shown in Fig. 3 where the surface mesh near the pipe exit is magnified to visualize the orthogonality of the mesh. The value of the non-dimensional distance from the pipe wall based on the friction velocity , Y+, for a near-wall cell is strictly controlled to be in the range of 20 ~ 50, when a wall-function is used. However, the Y+ value for a near-wall cell is set below 1 in the case without a wall-function. The distribution of mesh cells along the streamwise direction is selected based on iterative grid-dependency tests. So, the mesh size used in this study is depending on the use of a wall function. The mesh used for a high-Re turbulence model is composed of 152,150 hexahedral cells. But for a low-Re turbulence model, the number of cells is 562,080. Fig. 4 shows the numerical results of the Sudo et al.¡®s experiment by using the standard k-¦Å turbulence model. Fig. 4a is streamwise velocity profiles on cut-planes near the elbow, and Fig. 4b is streamlines to show the swirling flow. From the figures, it can be expected that the primary streamwise flow and secondary swirling flow are correlated in the elbow pipe flow. 

Fig. 4 Numerical results for experiment of Sudo et al. (1998): (a) streamwise velocity profiles, (b) streamlines. 


A comparison between the calculated and measured streamwise velocity profiles along the 
symmetric lines (i.e. ¦È=90¡ã) in the downstream 
region of the elbow are shown in Fig. 5. In the figure, the positive and negative r/D indicates the outer and inner part from the center of the circular pipe section, respectively. It should be noted that 
the horizontal length of the legend .+¡® used for 
the measured data in Fig. 5 indicates a ¡À10% error range normalized by the bulk velocity. It is found that the streamwise velocity components from the standard k-¦Å turbulence model agree very well with the measured data in the outer region with positive radii. On the contrary, some discrepancies between the numerical and measured data in the inner region with negative radii are observed. These discrepancies may arise due to the adverse pressure gradient near the inner wall of the pipe bend.

Figs. 6 and 7 show the streamwise and circumferential velocity components, respectively, 
along the cross lines (i.e. ¦È=0¡ã) in the downstream 
region of the bend pipe. The circumferential velocity component means secondary or swirling velocity component. The velocity profiles along the cross lines are predicted well at different locations in the downstream region of the elbow. 


3.1.2 Assessment of turbulence models 
The main objective of the present study is to characterize the secondary flow in the downstream of the elbow through numerical simulations. As such, after selection of mesh size, suitable convective scheme and under-relaxation parameters, it is of great importance to select appropriate turbulence model that can simulate the flow across the elbow accurately.  In view of this, OpenFOAM contains various turbulence models, which include one-equation and two-equation models based on Boussinesq assumption, Reynolds stress transport model (RSTM), and large eddy simulation (LES). It is still challenging to apply LES for a high Reynolds number turbulent flow in a very long pipe. In this study, the RSTM turbulence models are excluded from the assessment because of numerical and turbulence model problems in obtaining an acceptable solution, and remain as future work. For the assessment, only the linear and non-linear eddy-viscosity turbulence models are considered. In Table 3, the turbulence models to be used for the assessment are listed.

Turbulence models can be grouped based on modeling of near wall flow and turbulent eddy viscosity. In Table 3, turbulence models numbered 1 through 7 utilize a wall-function to model the near wall region and the remaining models simulate the near-wall region without a wall-function. Shih¡®s model (No. 6 in Table 3) (Shih et al., 1993) and Lein¡®s models (Nos. 7 & 10 in Table 3) (Lien et al., 1996; Lien and Leschziner, 1993) are the non-linear models, where eddy viscosity is related by more than second moment of velocity gradient.

Fig. 9 Hit rates of turbulence models for streamwise velocity components on symmetric lines of Sudo et al.¡®s bent pipe, ---: average hit rate (74.3%). 
Fig. 8 shows the numerical results from different turbulence models for streamwise velocity profiles along the symmetric line at x/D = 0. The numerical results from some of the turbulence models listed in Table 3 provide reasonable 
agreement compared with Sudo et al.¡®s experimental data and Tanaka et al.¡®s LES results. 
However, it is difficult to choose an appropriate turbulence model from the qualitative comparison. As such, a quantitative assessment method is applied to select an appropriate turbulence model. Each turbulence model is implemented to simulate Sudo et al.¡®s experiments and a comparative study is performed between numerical simulations and experimental measurements. The number of points within the error bounds of the experimental data is counted. 
A comparison is called a ¨Dhit¡¬ if the numerical 
result lies within ¡À10% of the bulk velocity from the measured value, otherwise it is called a 
¨Dmiss¡¬. 


The probing locations and measured data used for the quantitative assessment of the turbulence models are plotted in Figs. 5, 6, and 7 which denote the three assessment objects, i.e., streamwise velocity component on the symmetric lines and streamwise and circumferential velocity components on the cross lines. The number of points used in each assessment is 135. Figs. 9, 10, and 11 show the hit rates for each turbulence model, where the turbulence models are sorted by the number of hits. In the assessment of streamwise velocity along the symmetric lines, SNKE has the highest number of hits followed by LCKE and RKE. It is found that along the cross

without wall functions, such as LSLOW, LLLOW, LBLOW, and LCLOW, have a higher than average number of hits. However, in the assessment of circumferential velocity along the cross lines, the low-Re number turbulence models perform poorly and KMSST & RNGKE record the highest number of hits. The above assessment shows that some of the turbulence models consistently perform below the average. These turbulence models are eliminated from the future assessments. Additionally, it is not likely to find a single turbulence model with maximum number of hits for all three assessments. As such, two additional criteria are applied for the selection of an appropriate turbulence model. The first step utilizes the average number of hits for each assessment and the second criterion considers the deviation from the maximum hit rate. The deviation of each assessment, 
, from the maximum hit rate is given by: 

(1) 
where xi, xmax, and N represent the hit rate for the ith turbulence model, maximum hit rate and the number of turbulence models used in the assessment, respectively It is found that RNGKE has consistently greater than average hit rates for the assessment of all the three velocity profiles. Although SNKE has highest number of hits for the streamwise velocity along the symmetric lines, it does not predict other velocity profiles satisfactorily. Therefore, SNKE is not considered for the final calculations. Four turbulence models namely, EKE, RNGKE, RKE, and KMSST satisfy the criterion based on the deviation from the maximum hit rate. In order to select a single turbulence model out of these four, the selection criterion is changed to reduce the range of deviation by 2/3 of ¦Ò. Based on this quantitative assessment RNGKE turbulence model is selected for investigating the flow in the elbow. This is consistent with the previous study (Homicz, 2004), which has shown that RNGKE turbulence model performs better than SKE for flow in bends. Also in the simulation of Rahimzadeh et al. (2012) of a turbulent flow over circular spillways, it is seen that RNGKE turbulence model gives very similar results to experiment and RSTM model.

lines, the streamwise velocity is predicted well by most of the turbulence models except SNKE and The experiment on a turbulent flow in a pipe with LCKE. The low-Re number turbulence models a 90-degree-bent elbow conducted in this study is numerically simulated with the RNGKE turbulence model, which was chosen through a quantitative evaluation of the simulation results of 
Sudo et al.¡®s bend pipe. Numerical and 
experimental results are shown in Figs. 12 and 13 for the case of Run1 where the bulk velocity is 1 m/s and its Reynolds number is 50,800. Streamwise velocity distributions along vertical symmetric lines at 3.5D, 10D, and 50D in the horizontal pipe after the elbow are plotted in Fig. 
12. It is seen in the figure that the streamwise velocity is shifted upward just after the elbow, and is redistributed downstream. Fig. 13 shows the streamwise velocity distributions along the horizontal cross lines at the same locations as in Fig. 12. The symmetry of the flow is easily observed from the figure. The streamwise velocity near the pipe wall is a little augmented because of its reduction in the central region of the pipe section by swirls at 3.5D. However, the peaks near the pipe wall are diffused by turbulent dissipation at 10D. It looks like the calculated results by the currently used numerical schemes and turbulence model match well with the measured data. From a comparison of the velocity profiles, it can be thought that the turbulence model used in this study gives mostly acceptable results for the flow in a bend pipe. To evaluate the dependency of a flow after the elbow on the Reynolds number, the streamwise velocities normalized by the bulk velocity of each test are compared in Fig. 14. It is shown that the velocity profiles from the three tests are coincident with each other, which means that there exists a similarity in the structure of flows after a bend with the same curvature radius if the Reynolds number is in the range of 50000 and 200000. Furthermore, it is found that the normalized velocity at the center of the pipe at 50D downstream of the elbow decreases with increasing Reynolds number. This happens because in a fully developed turbulent pipe flow the flattening of the velocity profile increases with Re. This observation is also consistent with the recent experiments in super-pipe flow facility (Zagarola and Smits, 1997). The streamwise velocities from a numerical simulation of the three test cases Run1, Run2, and Run3 are compared in Fig. 15. The velocity profiles along the cross lines at three different locations downstream of the elbow coincide well with each other, as do the measured data. It is also shown in the figure that the velocity near the center of the pipe at 50D downstream is flattened more as the Reynolds number increases.

4. CHARACTERIZATION OF SECONDARY FLOW INDUCED BY 90-DEGREE BEND 
In this section, the dissipation characteristics of secondary flow in the downstream region of the 90-degree elbow are discussed. The secondary flow generated during the flow across the elbows consists of two counter-rotating vortices or swirls. In general, the strength of a swirl on a cut plane normal to the axial flow direction is represented by the swirl number (Chigier and Beer, 1964). The swirl number is the area-averaged flux of angular momentum and it is used to quantify the strength of a swirl around the axis of the main flow. However, a direct application of the swirl number to counter-rotating vortices such as those created by the secondary flow in an elbow is not appropriate. To define the intensity of counter-rotating swirls, Sudo et al. (1998) used the magnitude of velocity tangential to a pipe section area. Eq. (2) shows the definition of the swirl intensity used for the elbow flows in this study. 

(2) where 
is the swirl intensity, 
is the vector of 
the flow velocity and 
is a unit vector normal to the pipe section area. To obtain the area-averaged swirl intensity at each pipe section along the downstream pipe after the elbow, the flow solution is mapped to a two-dimensional mesh with the same area as the pipe section because of the use of unstructured meshes in this study, and the tangential velocities from the mapped solution are integrated on the 2-D mesh. Fig. 16 shows planar 2-D meshes inserted in the computational domain for a pipe flow. In the figure, the dark-colored areas mean the 2-D meshes used for area-averaged swirl intensities. The intensity of secondary flow calculated from Eq. (2) at different axial locations downstream of the elbow is normalized by the value of intensity at the exit of the elbow. The normalized swirl intensity for elbow with Rc/D = 2 along the downstream pipe after the elbow is depicted in Fig. 17. It can be seen that the swirl intensity generated by the elbow is exponentially diminished along the downstream pipe. The numerical result by the RNG k-¦Å turbulence model reproduces well the decay characteristic of 
the swirl obtained by Sudo et al.¡®s experiment.  
In the same way, the decay characteristic of the secondary flow downstream of the elbow with curvature radius of 3D, which represents the experimental facility used in this study, is evaluated only based on the numerical solutions because the swirl components of the flow velocities are not measured in the experiment. The swirl intensities for the three test conditions (Run1, Run2, and Run3) were calculated along the downstream horizontal pipe. Transitions of the swirl intensities along the pipe for the three cases (50800 ¡Ü Re ¡Ü 203200) are shown in Fig. 18. In the comparison of the swirl intensities among the cases, as shown in the figure, they show similar trends of swirl intensity decay to the case of 2D curvature radius of elbow with a minor dependency on the Reynolds numbers of the flows. It is found that the dissipation of Is for all flow conditions can be expressed as an exponentially decreasing function as 

(3) 
where the coefficient 
represents the rate at which the secondary flow intensity decreases 
downstream of the elbow. The numerical value of 
is found to be 0.21 to obtain a best fit between the data and correlation presented in Eq. (3). Based on Eq. (3), 
dissipates to 10% of its initial value at approximately 11D downstream of the elbow. To investigate the effect of other geometric parameters, such as the radius of curvature, the results are compared with the previous velocity measurement of Al-Rafai et al. (1990) with LDA in bent pipe flow with two different radii of curvature, RC/D = 3.49 and 6.98, at Re = 34132.  Additionally, numerical simulations of the flow were performed by using the commercial CFD code Phoenics. Turbulent flows in the 90-degree bent pipes with the same geometric and physical conditions as in Al-Rafai et al.¡®s experiment are simulated using the RNG k-¦Å turbulence model and it is found that the current numerical method and the turbulence model give very acceptable results. Here, only the swirl intensities from the computed results are introduced and compared with other results. Table 4 shows the list of experiments used to characterize the swirl intensity of secondary flow. In the list, the radius of the elbow curvature is in the range of 2D to 7D, and the Reynolds number is from 30000 to 200000. In Fig. 19, the swirl intensities along the downstream pipes of the elbows are shown for the cases listed in Table 4. In the cases of curvature radii lower than or equal to Al-Rafai et al.¡®s smaller bend (3.49D), the swirl intensities show a very similar trend of decay even with different Reynolds numbers. However, in the case of Al-Rafai et al.¡®s larger bend (6.975D), it decays very quickly compared to the other cases.

The swirl intensities at the exit of the elbows for 
the five cases (one for Sudo et al.¡®s study, three 
for the current experiments, and two for Al-Rafai et al.¡®s study) are compared in Figs. 20 and 21. It is observed that the swirl intensity at the exit of the elbows has a weak dependence on the flow Reynolds number and a higher dependence on the radius of curvature of the bend. However, additional studies are necessary to provide a correlation between swirl intensity and the elbow radius of curvature. 


5. CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, experimental and numerical work on a turbulent flow in a pipe with a 90-degree elbow was performed. In order to select an appropriate turbulence model for the turbulent flow in the bent pipe, a quantitative assessment method based on hit rate was applied by using Sudo et al.¡®s experimental data. The assessment showed that the RNG k-¦Å turbulence model gives good results for primary streamwise velocity and secondary swirling velocity profiles compared to other turbulence models. The non-linear turbulence models showed a good predictability for the streamwise velocity components but they gave poor results in secondary swirling velocity components. As a future work, it is required to study the applicability of the non-linear turbulence models for complicated swirling flows. The experiments on turbulent flows in the pipe with an elbow with a curvature radius of 3D were conducted by varying the Reynolds number, and numerically simulated using the RNG k-¦Å turbulence model to evaluate the dependency of a flow after the elbow on the Reynolds number. It was found from the experimental and numerical study that there is a strong similarity in streamwise velocity profiles in the range of Reynolds number from 50,000 to 200,000. Using the numerical method and turbulence model selected from this study, the characteristics of swirl intensity after an elbow were examined. It was found that the swirl intensity defined in terms of area averaged tangential velocity decreases exponentially along the flow after the elbow, dissipating quicker as the radius of the elbow curvature is larger. It was also found that this dissipation characteristic depends weakly on the Reynolds number in the range of Reynolds numbers investigated in this study and strongly on the bend curvature. The swirl intensities at the exit of the elbows also display similar characteristics.

CO-COMBUSTION OF COAL AND OIL SHALE BLENDS IN CIRCULATING FLUIDIZED BED BOILERS 
Abstract.
Coal co-firing experiments were conducted in a 250 MW oil shale fired circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) boiler. The objective of the experiments was to test whether adding coal to oil shale would allow the use of the latter with lower heating value. Bituminous coal was mixed with oil shale and fed into the boiler via existing fuel feeding ports. Two test series were accomplished: 11每29% thermal input of coal mixed with 8.4 MJ/kg oil shale (standard fuel), and 12每32% thermal input of coal mixed with 7.5 MJ/kg oil shale. During the experiments, which lasted in total for 15 days, ash samples were collected and flue gas analysis was performed. The boilers were able to continue work with all the fuel mixtures, but a significant increase of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and heat losses due to unburnt carbon in the bottom and fly ashes were observed. The heat losses can be reduced by upgrading the fuel preparation system, but NOx emissions limit can be reached only with installation of an additional DeNOx system. The ash chemical composition remained similar. Sulphur emissions stayed minimal, but a slight increase of carbon monoxide concentration was noticed. Coal co-firing is possible in oil shale CFBC boilers, but the coal must have low fuel itrogen content and extra attention to the fuel preparation system has to be paid. 
Keywords: circulating fluidized bed combustion, oil shale and coal blend, co-combustion, emissions. 
1. Introduction 
Estonian oil shale (OS) industry has long-term experience in oil shale utilization. Today＊s industry has implemented circulating fluidized bed com-bustion (CFBC) technology, older pulverized combustion (PC) power units have been equipped with modern DeSOx and DeNOx equipment. Transition to the CFBC technology resolved problems with fouling of heating sur-faces, and NOx and SO2 emission. CFBC boilers have demonstrated fuel flexibility 每 biomass and peat co-combustion decreased gaseous pollutants, particulate matter and ash emissions [1, 2]. The oil shale CFBC boiler has also been used for utilization of pyrolytic wastewater. Successful com-bustion tests were conducted, the NOx and SO2 emissions remained low [3]. The power industry is trying to decrease its environmental impact while still keeping in use old PC power units although it has been found that PC boilers have even a higher environmental impact during load cycling [4, 5]. Considering this, co-combustion of biomass in a CFBC unit offers a good alternative to impact reduction. A number of biomass co-firing examples are available [6每9], the biomass co-combustion experiments showed positive impact also at oil shale power plants [1]. The motivation for coal co-firing in oil shale boilers enables the use of oil shale with lower heating value in the existing boilers without major retrofits. Calorific value of oil shale depends on oil shale layers and mining locations. Therefore, oil shale beneficiation plants are needed [10]. The use of oil shale in Estonia is limited and is directed towards oil production. One reason for the use of coal in OS CFBC energy units is that power companies try to expand the portfolio of fuels and leave more OS for shale oil production. Prior to industrial testing, the Department of Energy Technology, Tallinn University of Technology conducted a laboratory test on its own laboratory scale 60 kW CFB combustion test facility. The laboratory test gave the input to industrial tests and enabled choosing a proper methodology and paying attention to possible problems. Laboratory tests revealed there was a problem with nitrogen emissions. To explore the possibilities of coal and oil shale co-combustion in a CFBC boiler oil shale was mixed with coal. At the second stage, oil shale with a slightly lower heating value was used. The results and conclusions of the experiments are summarised in this paper. 
2. Experimental 
2.1. The boiler 
The firing tests of oil shale and coal blends were carried out in the CFBC double boiler energy unit. The electrical capacity of the energy unit was 215 MWel. The main parameters of the power unit are given in Table 1. Table 1. Main parameters of the power unit Parameter  Value  Steam mass flow (primary/secondary), kg/s Primary/reheat steam pressure, MPa Primary/reheat steam temperature, During the tests, the analyses of fuel, ash and flue gas were carried out. The location of ports (1每8) for collecting ash samples is shown in Figure 1. Fuel samples were collected on a daily average basis. The ash was sampled from several extraction ports located in the furnace chamber, super-/reheater (SH, RH), economizer (ECO), air preheater (APH) and from all four fields of the electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Samples of fly ash for determining the mass division (total suspended particulates PM 10/2.5) were collected after ESP. The samples were used for determining the detailed chemical composi-tion of ash.

The results of analyses were averaged to reach a representative estimate. During the tests, the major process parameters of the boiler and energy unit were recorded with the plant data acquisition system. The temperature and composition of flue gas were measured before ESP. The composition of flue gas and the flue gas moisture content were determined applying a Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-type analyser for wet gas, at a tem-perature of 180 ∼C. 
2.2. Fuels 每 oil shale and coal 
Table 2 and Table 3 present the results of proximate and ultimate analysis of the fuels. 
Carbon was present in both the organic and mineral matter of oil shale, the same applied to coal. During oil shale combustion the mineral (CO2)m is released as a result of decomposition of carbonate minerals. The average extent of carbonate minerals decomposition was around 70%, varying strongly in different ash flows [11]. The main element in the oil shale ash was calcium. Calcium oxide content in the coal ash was considerably lower (Table 4).

The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of coal and oil shale are shown in Figure 2. The figure reveals that the coal ignition occurred at a rather low temperature (< 200 ∼C) and the combustion was finished before the temperature reached 650 ∼C. No later char burning could be noticed, there was only a small mass loss due to decomposition of carbonate minerals. Based on the data no problems with fuel burnout were predicted. The fuel mixtures for full-scale experiments (Table 5) were prepared on the fuel conveyor belt. The experiments lasted for 15 days. Each fuel mixture was fired for at least 24 h. During the experimental period, a large number of samples were collected.

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Temperatures of bed, furnace, separators and air preheater 
Coal co-firing experiments were conducted in the oil shale fired industrial CFBC boiler. Overall the experiments were successful, no emergency shut downs occurred. The plant data acquisition system provided temperature readings from various locations. To illustrate changes in the CFBC boiler some chosen temperatures are shown in Figure 3. The temperature above the dense bed increased with the increased share of coal. In contrast, the flue gas temperature in the entrance of the solid separator and after the air preheater was stable. The average temperature values support this notice (Fig. 4). The increased temperatures may lead to the fouling and sintering of ash on heating  surfaces,  which  were  typical  problems in oil shale PC  boilers [9].

zone, c) in the entrance of the solid separator, d) after the air preheater. The darker 
colour represents more coal in the fuel blend.

Experiments carried out by Parve et al. [12] showed that sintering of Estonian oil shale ashes became an issue when the temperature exceeded 900 ∼C. The temperatures measured in the boiler were well below the dangerous zone, but there were no measuring points in the centre of the boiler where the temperatures may be higher. Investigations carried out by Al-Otoom et al. [13] have shown that firing of Jordanian El-Lajjun oil shale would pose minimal operational problems related to sintering and agglomeration if the operating temperature is between 800 ∼C and 900 ∼C. 
3.2. The chemical composition of ash samples 
Typically, there is no problem with oil shale burnout, the organic carbon content in the boiler ashes is below 0.1% [1]. The results of chemical analysis of ash show relatively high levels of organic carbon, Corg (Table 6). When obtaining the ash samples, an unusual picture was taken of the bottom ash conveyor (Fig. 5). Orange glowing particles and black particles were seen. Unburnt particles were visible to the naked eye. This encouraged in depth fuel preparations control.  As seen in Figure 6, oversized coal particles

were found in the fuel. Particle size analysis showed that a higher share of coal in the fuel mixture resulted in larger particles (Fig. 7). The maximum particle diameter allowed for the boiler by the design was 15 mm. The fuel preparation system was not able to crush coal as efficiently as required because Oil Shale Hard Groove Index (HGI) is considerably lower when compared with coal. The mineral composition of ash is presented in Table 7. The composition of ash flows, i.e. bottom ash (BA) and ashes of electrostatic precipitator field 1 (ESP1) and field 2 (ESP2), is similar to that of ash from pure oil shale combustion. The calcite content is typically higher in BA, dolomite exists only in BA and is absent in fine ash fractions (ESP1 and ESP2). The anhydrite (CaSO4) content is the highest in the ESP2 ash, which indicates the binding of sulphur to finer ash fractions. 
Chemical analysis of the ash samples showed a measurable organic carbon content (Fig. 8). Based on on-site observations, unburnt organic carbon was expected in the bottom ash, but fly ash contained also some unburnt organic carbon. The carbon content and share of coal in the fuel mixture correlated. Heat losses due to unburnt fuel during experiment D (29% heat from coal) were 0.79%. This value is low compared to the typical values for coal boilers. The heat losses due to unburnt fuel when working with oil shale are as low as 0.02% [1].

Ash samples were collected and analysed, but no major changes in its chemical composition were noticed. The ashes were similar to typical oil shale CFBC ashes described by Plamus et al. [11]. The insignificant influence of coal additive on ash chemical composition could be explained by the relatively low coal ash content (15%) compared to oil shale＊s (55%). Nevertheless, some trends were still observed in the bottom ash: manganese had a positive correlation and chloride a negative correlation with coal mass share. The higher share of coal in the fuel mixture resulted in an increased content of sulphur, sodium, phosphorus, manganese, magnesium, aluminium and titanium in the fly ash. The content of potassium in the fly ash decreased. Although a number of trends were noticed, the changes were minor and should not alter the physical or chemical properties of the ashes. 
3.3. Flue gas and emissions 
The values of average concentrations of major gas emissions are presented in Table 8. The flue gas did not meet environmental requirements (NOx > 200mg/Nm3 at 6% O2) due to the high nitrogen oxides concentration (Fig. 9). The data analysis showed that nitrogen oxides concentration correlated with nitrogen content in the fuel mixture (Fig. 10). So the excess NOx was formed due to additional nitrogen in the fuel. The temperature in the boiler was around 800 ∼C, thus the nitrogen in air did not contribute to the NOx formation. The nitrogen content in oil shale was low (< 0.1%). Adding any fuel with a higher nitrogen content necessitated the use of a DeNOx solution. Sulphur dioxide emissions remained nearby the quantification limit of a standard FTIR gas analyser (5 ppm). The coal sulphur content was rather low and in addition, oil shale contained a lot of calcium that binds sulphur well in the CFBC boiler. It is possible to co-fire oil shale in the CFBC boiler with coals containing more sulphur without extra sulphur removal devices.

tional CFB combustion [16]. The nitrogen conversion ratio to NOx was found to be up to 24% and the emissions were rather low [16]. Investigations by Al-Makhadmeh et al. [17] have shown that in case of Jordanian El-Lajjun oil shale the NOx emissions are lower under oxy-fuel conditions than in air-firing mode. 
Estonian oil shale has a molar Ca/S ratio of 8每10 and no further addition of lime is necessary for the complete binding of sulphur. The sulphur content of El-Lajjun oil shale is nearly four times higher than that of Estonian oil shale. CaO and ash contents are comparable in both fuels. Al-Makhadmeh et al. [18] have found that a Ca/S molar ratio of 3 is sufficient to obtain the desulphurisation efficiencies up to 93每100%. To bind the sulphur it is necessary to add limestone. 
The content of total suspended particles (TSP) remained within the same limits, 30每40 mg/Nm3, independently of fuel blends. The content of the finest particles of fly ash together with its mass division (PM10/2.5) after ESP is an important indicator of flue gas composition. The mass division of the finest fly ash after ESP was determined for three coal and oil shale blends: 5/95, 10/90 and 15/85 (Fig. 12). It can be concluded that the dis-tribution of fine fly ash does not depend on the fuel blend. 
3.4. Issues and solutions 
The most important problem was the high nitrogen oxides concentration in the flue gas. There are no cheap ways to solve it. If it is necessary to use more nitrogen containing fuel in the power plant, then the DeNOx equipment must be installed. In the CFB boiler, the temperatures are considerably lower than in the PC boiler, but the technology requires temperature between 760 ∼C and 1090 ∼C. From Figure 3 it can be seen that the temperatures in the boiler stayed below the required values. It might be possible to increase the temperature of the gases, but it would be a technical challenge. There are no easy ways for reduction of nitrogen oxides emission for this type of technology. 
When co-firing coal and oil shale, two further problems were related to the presence of unburnt combustibles in the ashes and increased carbon monoxide concentration in the flue gas. Both increased the boiler heat losses, but were not as crucial as excess nitrogen monoxides in the flue gas. The TGA (Fig. 2) and proximate analysis (Table 2) suggested that there should be no problem with fuel burnout since coal had a high volatile content and its ignition and burnout temperatures were low. Coal was basically similar to oil shale; the only major difference was its considerably lower contents of ash and carbonate. However, the fuel-handling system for OS was not able to prepare the coal fuel. It resulted in oversized particles in the fuel feed and increased unburnt carbon content in the bottom ash. Upgrading the fuel handling system can reduce unburnt carbon in the bottom ash. Increasing the temperature in the furnace and balanced fuel feeding may decrease the losses due to unburnt fuel in the fly ash and carbon monoxide in the flue gas. 
4. Conclusions 
Coal co-firing with oil shale in an industrial CFBC boiler was performed. The maximum heat share of coal in the fuel blend was 31% and maximum mass share 15%. During the experiments the boiler maintained a stable load of 250 MWth (83每89 kgsteam/s). The flue gas emission did not meet the environmental requirements due to increased NOx concentration. The NOx concentration in the flue gas correlated strongly with the nitrogen content in the fuel mix. This indicates that the formation mechanism of NOx did not change. The average SO2 concentration in the flue gas remained close to the detection limit. The fuel preparation system could not provide the fuel of required quality, it contained oversized coal particles. This resulted in unburnt carbon in the ash and increased heat losses. The average CO concentration correlated with the coal share in the fuel mix, but remained in all cases below 70 mg/Nm3. The ash produced was similar to the typical calcium rich oil shale ash. 
The chemical analysis of the ash samples showed a measurable organic carbon content especially in BA, but also in the ESP ash. The highest TOC content was 0.6%. Typically, there was no problem with oil shale burnout, the organic carbon content in the boiler ashes was below 0.1%. Coal and oil shale co-firing fuel preparation should be continuously improved and the coal used should contain minimal organic nitrogen.

Combustion characteristics of solid waste biomass, oil shale, and coal 
ABSTRACT 
In this study, a developed two-dimensional mathematical model was used to represent the physical model of the combustion process of olive cake and date seed, and solve the governing equations using finite-volume method. The simulation was performed using ANSYS/Fluent software in order to estimate maximum temperature, heating values and pollutants concentrations. The obtained results were compared with experimental results, and corresponding values of oil shale and coal. The experimental work of direct burning of olive cake and date seeds was performed using an existing circulated fluidized bed (CFB) unit. 
It was found that the adiabatic flame temperatures were 1380 K and 839 K for olive cake and date seed, and 2260 K and 1080 K for coal and oil shale, respectively. The experimental results showed that the maximum tempera-tures were 1126 K and 723 K for olive cake and date seed, respectively. The lower heating values were 19,500 kJ/kg and 16,400 kJ/kg for olive cake and date seed, and 29,000 kJ/kg and 7000 kJ/kg for coal and oil shale, respectively. Thus, biomass such as date seed and olive cake may be used as an alter-native fuel in electrical power plants in olive-or date-producing countries, which may save 40% of fuel cost. 
Introduction 
Power generation from biomass has increased its share of total power generation in several countries. Despite the fact that prices of fossil fuels have dropped in recent years, benefits of biomass power generation such as carbon neutrality and energy security have prevented governments of many countries from abandoning the policy of increasing dependence on renewable energy and biomass. Biomass may be used to meet a wide variety of energy needs, including electricity generation, process heat for industry, and households heating. Partial replacing of conventional fossil fuels with biomass for energy production will result in a net reduction of greenhouse gases emissions and reduce the landfill (Gavaskar et al. 2012). The most common types of biomass energy applications reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 55每98% as compared to fossil fuels, even when transported long distances, as long as the biomass production does not cause any land-use change. Biomass may be used in a number of ways such as direct burning, gasification, fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and pyrolysis (Caputo et al. 2005; Gavaskar et al. 2012). Direct burning is the oldest and most common way of converting biomass energy into heat, mechanical power, or electricity. Circulated fluidized bed (FB) technique is one of the most competitive direct burning technologies for the utilization of biomass that enhance the efficiency of the combustion process while reducing the emission of harm gases (Caputo et al. 2005; Goswami 1986; Kunii and Levenspiel 1991). Biomass undergoes ignition, devolatilization, and solid char particles combustion stages during its combustion. Ignition is the process of initiating the combustion phenomenon, which is very important due to its influence on flame stability and extinction, pollutant formation, and emission. Devolatilization process involves the emission of the volatile gaseous matters, which are ignited and undergoes a homogenous combustion after heated up to a certain temperature. Solid char particles combustion, which is ignited as a result of volatile combustion, followed by a heterogeneous reaction, involves the direct attack of oxygen on the solid particles (Kunii and Levenspiel 1991). 
Olive cake, which is a waste of olive oil-mill, is an important biomass generated in Mediterranean countries where it is available in large amounts and low cost. Olive cake is considered as an alternative fuel source with very low sulfur contents, <0.1 wt%, which makes it an environmental-friendly fuel. Moreover, olive cake is a waste that needs a suitable and acceptable disposal, or it may cause environmental problems, which makes the utilization of olive waste in energy production not only a clean energy source but also an acceptable disposal of this waste. Jordan is one of the rich countries with olives and dates. Olive tree farming in Jordan started 1600 years ago. In the past few decades, the country witnessed a dramatic expansion in the olive tree agriculture. It is estimated that 15 million olive trees exist in Jordan. These trees produce around 230,000 tons of olives per year. The production process of olive oil involves the pressing of olives to produce 37,000 ton of olive oil and about 80,000 tons of solid waste, named olive cake (Ministry of Agriculture of Jordan, 2015). Topal, Atimtay, and Durmaz (2003) studied the combustion characteristics of olive cake produced in Turkey using a circulating FB. The concentrations of O2,SO2,CO2, CO, NOx, and total hydrocarbons were measured in the flue gas. It was found that the combustion efficiency for olive cake changes between 82.25% and 98.66% for various excess air ratios used in the study. 
The main problem of utilizing olive cake is the continuous supply since it is a seasonal product. This problem could be solved by co-firing olive cake with other fuels such as coal, oil shale, and other biomass like date seed in industrial and utility boilers. Atimtay and Topal (2004) studied the co-combustion of Turkish olive cake with coal in a circulating FB of 125-mm diameter and 1800-mm height. The results suggest that olive cake is good fuel that can be mixed with coal for cleaner energy production in small-scale industries using CFB. 
Co-combustion of coal and olive oil waste has been investigated by Armesto et al. (2003). They used two different Spanish coals in their study. The results of their tests have shown that the combustion of olive cake/coal mixtures decreases the emissions of SO2 and NOx. Regarding date seed, Jordan has considerable amounts of date seed that may be utilized as renewable energy source. Saudi Arabia and Iraq, which are Jordan neighbor countries, produce about two million tons of date per year. The date seed waste represents around 15% of those quantities by weight. 
Hussain, Farooq, and Bassyouni (2014) studied the utilization of Saudi Arabian Date Palm waste through pyrolysis process. They did Thermogravimetric analysis to understand the pyrolysis behavior of palm date wastes and designed an FB to study hydrodynamics and develop optimum conditions for the pyrolysis of palm wastes. The pyrolysis is used to produce activated carbon and the waste can also be readily converted to liquid phenolic products. Experimental results have indicated potential opportunities of using the date biomass waste as a potential fuel in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Joardder, Shazib Uddin, and Nurul Islam (2011) studied the conversion of date seed waste into activated carbon and bio-fuel by fixed bed pyrolysis reactor. The date seeds in particle form were pyrolyzed in an externally heated fixed bed reactor with nitrogen as the carrier gas. A maximum liquid yield of 50 wt% and char of 30 wt% were obtained at a reactor bed temperature of 500∼C with a running time of 120 min. The oil is found to possess favorable flash point and reasonable density and viscosity. Al Asfar et al. (2016) developed a two-dimensional (2D) mathematical model to analyze the combus-tion process of Jordanian oil shale in a circulating FB burner. They found that the adiabatic flame temperature was 1080 K, while the obtained experimental results of maximum temperature at various locations of the vertical burner in an actual, non-adiabatic, non-stoichiometric combustion reached 950 K. Hammad and Al Asfar (2017) performed a comparative theoretical and experimental study on the direct burning processes of oil shale and coal in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion unit. 
They solved using Ansys/Fluent the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy, and mass diffusion using finite-volume method. They validated their model by comparing their theoretical results with experimental ones. They found that the adiabatic flame temperature was 1080 K for oil shale compared with 2260 K for coal. 
In this work, the adiabatic temperature, lower heating value, air fuel ratio, and effect of burner＊s length on minimizing combustion pollutant gases are investigated theoretically. An existing direct burning unit of 3-kW power was used to conduct experimental work to evaluate the values of temperature at certain locations during combustion process of the biomass and other selected solid fuels. The temperature values were also recorded during actual burning of oil shale and solid waste bio mass, and compared with theoretical values. A developed 2D mathematical model was used to represent the physical model of the combustion process and solve the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy, mass diffusion, and chemical combustion reactions kinetics numeri-cally using finite-volume method. The simulation was performed using ANSYS/Fluent software in order to estimate maximum temperature, heating values, and pollutants concentrations. The obtained results are important to investigate the possibility of using biomass as an alternative energy source in olive-and date-producing countries. 
Composition and thermophysical properties 
The elemental composition of date seed and olive cake in terms of the molar percentages of C, H, O, N, and S components was determined experimentally. The proximate composition in terms of moisture, volatile, fixed carbon, and ash fractions was also determined. Thermal conductivity test equipment and bomb calorimeter were used to determine the thermal conductivity and heating value. Table 1 shows the results of proximate and ultimate analyses of date seed and olive cake in addition to experimentally estimated thermophysical properties(Al Asfar et al. 2016; Hammad and Al Asfar 2017). 
Physical model 
The physical model consists of an experimental combustion unit composed of a 0.5-m diameter, 3-m-height vertical combustion chamber, two 0.3-m-diameter cyclones, and temperature measurement system. Figure 1 represents a 3D sketch of the burner used in this study. For more details on the combustion unit, see (Al Asfar et al. 2016).

Experimental work 
The combustion of olive cake and date seed was investigated experimentally under excess air condition. Temperature measurement was achieved using 11 k-type thermocouples distributed along burner length. Thermocouples were connected to an LAB view unit with interference designed for this project. Gas Analyzer Nova Plus with serial number (012293) was used for exhaust gases analysis. Continues combustion was noted for both biomass fuels. 
To validate the simulation model, the maximum temperature resulted from biomass model is compared to the maximum temperature obtained experimentally in the experimental combustion burner unit. The maximum temperature of 962 K was measured experimentally using the burner unit, which is close to the result of the simulation (1080 K). The difference from theoretical results for temperature is due to the fact that in the actual burning process the combustion efficiency was not 100%, and the process was not adiabatic due to heat transfer from the burner to surroundings. In addition to presence of certain percentage of excess air which cause reducing of combustion temperature. 
Mathematical model 
The mathematical model represents the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy, mass diffusion, and chemical combustion reaction kinetics. Those equations were solved numerically using a high-resolution mesh accounting for the solid and gaseous phases, k 每 汍 turbulence, non-premixed combustion model, and reacting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with the same dimension and material of the experimental combustion burner of this study (Al Asfar et al. 2016). 
The burner mesh was created with two velocity inlet surfaces: one for the air at 2 m/s and the other for the fuel with a flow rate of 0.01 kg/s. In addition to one pressure outlet surface at the exhaust, and three wall-surfaces with a temperature of 1000 K for the combustion chamber walls. Non-premixed combustion model was selected since the fuel and the oxidizer enter the chamber in distinct streams. Non-adiabatic system was also assumed, which requires the solution for the modeled transport equation for time average enthalpy (Kunii and Levenspiel 1991): 
where Sh accounts for source terms due to radiation, heat transfer to wall boundary, and heat exchange with the second phase, and the total enthalpy is defined as follows: 
where Yj is the mass fraction of species j, and is the formation enthalpy of species j at the reference temperature Tref,j. The turbulent viscosity is solved using the k 汍 model that 
where k and 汍 are obtained from the transport equations and C米 is constant. 
The mole fractions of oil shale species during the combustion process were estimated using probability density function (PDF) module integrated in ANSYS/Fluent software. Then, a discrete particle model (DPM) in 3D steady-state space is used to solve numerically the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy, and mass diffusion to estimate species fraction before and throughout combustion, temperature, radiation, convection heat transfer, pressure, density, etc. The chemical reversible reactions involving those species during combustion were taken into account (Al Asfar et al. 2016). Those species include C, H, N, O, S, C(s),S(s),CH4,H2, CO, CO2,N2,O2, OH, H2O, HS, H2S, SO, SO2,CS2, NO, NO2, and C2H6. The chemical reversible reactions involving these species during combustion were taken into account, since they are already built in fluent PDF module. Thermal, prompt, and fuel NOx formation were taken into account, in addition to thermal SOx which was computed through the simulation by enabling NOx and SOx modules. 
Results 
The following set of figures presents obtained results of direct burning of olive cake, date seed, oil shale and coal for flame temperature, and discrete particle module of solid combustion. In Figures 2 and 3, the devolatilization rate contours for date seed and olive cake show that volatiles are released with a maximum rate of 1.8 g/s, leading to slightly downstream of solid fuel feeding position. Volatiles were released slower in date seed with a rate of 0.5 g/s. Both biomass fuels have faster devolatilization rate as compared with oil shale, 0.125 g/s (Al Asfar et al. 2016). After completing devolatilization, the burnout started with a maximum rate of 0.0746, 0.0119, and 0.0123 g/s for olive cake, date seed, and oil shale, respectively. Burnout rate for date seed was the slowest, whereas burnout rate for coal was the fastest. 
Figures 4 and 5 show the temperature distribution in the FB burner for olive cake and date seed, respectively. The maximum temperature of olive cake combustion was 1380 K, while the average bed temperature was about 950 K, which represents a good agreement with experimental results. On the other hand, the maximum temperature of date seed combustion was 839 K in flame front, then decreased to 761 K. The experimental results showed that the maximum temperatures were 1126 K and 723 K for olive cake and date seed, respectively.

Figure 5. Temperature contours for fluidized bed date seed combustion chamber. 
The maximum temperatures for all three alternative fuels were much lower than that for coal, which is 2260 K (Hammad and Al Asfar 2017). 
The maximum carbon dioxide CO2 mass fractions were 5.9%, 3.74%, and 3.8% for olive cake, date seed, and oil shale, respectively. The contour lines for CO2 mass fraction differ according to the burnout shape, while the concentration of CO was reduced from 8.01 PPM at the flame to <0.801 PPM at the exit. The results also show that the maximum concentration of produced SOx and NOx may not be taken into account when environmental effects are considered. 
Based on obtained results, it may be suggested that it requires about 1.5 tons of biomass (olive cake and date seed) to obtain the same energy produced from 1 ton of coal. This increase in mass will not be in coal favour; since the price of waste biomass in Jordan is about one tenth of coal price. Thus, the use of biomass will save around 40% of fuel cost. In terms of pollution, biomass produces very little sulfur and carbon oxides: SOx and NOx, which will have no serious effects on environment or health. On the other hand, the lower heating value was 16,400 kJ/kg and 19,500 kJ/kg for date seed and olive cake, and 29,000 kJ/kg and 7000 kJ/kg for coal and oil shale, respectively.

Deep neural network inversion for 3D laser absorption imaging of methane in reacting flows
Abstract
Mid-infrared laser absorption imaging of methane in flames
is performed with a learning-based approach to the limited
view-angle  inversion  problem.  A  deep  neural  network  is
trained with superimposed Gaussian field distributions of
spectral absorption coefficients, and the prediction capabil-
ity is compared to linear tomography methods at a varying
number of view angles for simulated fields representative
of a flame pair. Experimental 3D imaging is demonstrated
on a methane–oxygen laminar flame doublet (<cm) backlit
with  tunable  radiation  from  an  interband  cascade  laser
near 3.16 µm. Spectrally resolved data at each pixel provide
for species-specific projected absorbance. 2D images were
collected at six projection angles on a high-speed infrared
camera,  yielding  an  aggregate  of  27,648  unique  lines  of
sight capturing the scene with a pixel resolution of ∼70 µm.
Mole fraction measurements are inferred from the predicted
absorption coefficient images using an estimated tempera-
ture field, showing consistency with expected values from
reactant flow rates. To the authors’ knowledge, this work
represents the first 3D imaging of methane in a reacting
flow.   
INTRODUCTION
Methane  (CH4)  is  an  important  molecule  in  combustion
chemistry, representing the primary fuel component of natural
gas  and  a  key  intermediate  in  larger  hydrocarbon  oxidation.
Accordingly, quantitative imaging of methane in flame envi-
ronments  is  desired  to  discern  the  competitive  physics  of
chemical kinetics with mass and heat transport. Some optical
methods have shown potential for imaging methane in high-
temperature reacting flows, albeit with somewhat constrained
applicability. Point and line measurements of CH4  in flames
have  been  performed  with  Raman  scattering  techniques  [1],
and 2D tomographic measurements have been performed using
near-infrared  diode  laser  absorption  in  oscillating  CH4–air
flames [2] and marine engine cylinders [3]. Here, we present a
novel mid-infrared optical method for 3D imaging of CH4  in
high-temperature flame environments.
Advances  in  midwave  infrared  photonics  have  enabled
tomographic  absorption  spectroscopy  [4]  at  the  fundamen-
tal  vibrational  frequencies  of  important  combustion  species,
providing for sensitive thermochemical measurements in small-
scale reacting flows using compact low-power light sources [5].
Laser  absorption  imaging  (LAI)  is  a  complimentary  method
developed to capture scenes backlit with tunable laser radiation
at very high spatial resolution using high-speed infrared cameras
[6–8]. A representative optical arrangement, used in this work,
is shown in Fig. 1. Recently, LAI has been successfully coupled
with 1D tomography for quantitative imaging of axisymmetric
flow-field thermochemistry at sub-100-µm resolution [6,7].
Tomographic  imaging  of  non-axisymmetric  flows  is  more
challenging—multiple   projection   angles   are   required   to
estimate  the  flow-field  scalars,  and  the  inversion  problem  is
underdetermined  [4,9].  Limited  view  angles  often  result  in
a blurring effect and artifacts in the reconstructed flow-field,
complicating  applications  to  flames,  which  have  very  thin
(∼1 mm) reaction zones. Laser absorption tomography efforts
in combustion flows have demonstrated different approaches to
the inversion problem, including both linear [10–13] and non-
linear [14,15] methods utilizing various optical arrangements.
Increasingly  complex  and  dense  lines  of  sight  configurations
require  computationally  efficient  image  processing  methods.
Recently,  predictive  models  utilizing  neural  networks  have
shown  promise  to  more  efficiently  solve  the  inversion  prob-
lem with limited information, and have been applied to both
simulated flows [16] and emission measurements of real flows
[17–19]. Here, we combine a deep neural network inversion
with LAI to achieve high-resolution 3D imaging of CH4  in a
non-axisymmetric  high-temperature  flow-field.  We  compare
the deep neural network inversion to linear tomography, assess-
ing performance with regards to accuracy and computational
cost, via both simulation and experiment.
With  any  tomographic  absorption  spectroscopy  method,
the   analytical   problem   reduces   to   inverting   line-of-sight
integrated  (or  projected)  absorption  data  [4,9].  For  a  non-
uniform gas medium, the Beer–Lambert law integrated over
wavenumber   ν[cm−1]—or   the   projected   absorbance   area
A j ,proj[cm−1]—can be expressed for each line-of-sight
where α(ν) is spectral absorbance, I0  is incident light intensity,
and It  is transmitted light intensity. L [cm] is the aggregate path
length along the line of sight. Thermochemical properties of
the nonuniform medium are embedded in the spatially resolved
absorption coefficient K j [cm−2], where total pressure P  [atm]
is assumed 1 atm, S j (T)[cm−2/atm] is the line strength of rovi-
brational transition j at temperature T[K], and X abs is the mole
fraction. For tomographic LAI, Eq. (1) applies to each camera
pixel, wherein spectrally resolved absorbance can be integrated
to yield 2D images of A j ,proj, representative examples of which
are depicted in the insets of Fig. 1 for different viewing angles.
With multiple projection angles, each horizontal row of pixels
in each 2D image can be treated independently for subsequent
reconstruction of the flow-field scalar K j . For the experimental
setup depicted in Fig. 1, we target a collection of rovibrational
transitions comprising the R(15) manifold of the v3  asymmet-
ric stretch band of CH4  near 3.16 µm. The line strengths for
these transitions do not vary more than 10% for temperatures
between 450 and 750 K [20], enabling quantitative inference of
mole fraction from K j  in the preheat zone.
METHOD
In this study, we utilize a deep neural network to perform the
inversion of line-of-sight integrated absorption measurements
A j ,proj to solve for K j , and compare its reconstruction perform-
ance with linear 2D tomography methods. The training dataset
consists of 2D fields of the methane absorption coefficient K j ,
represented as superimposed Gaussian distributions as shown
in the top of Fig. 2. The simulations included 5000 variations in
intensity, size, and relative locations of the Gaussians. The cor-
responding projected absorbance areas A j ,proj  are subsequently
calculated utilizing Radon transforms to represent the measure-
ment data at each angle with appropriate pixel density reflecting
the LAI experimental setup. Gaussian noise (3%) was applied
to the input, enabling the network to learn robust inversion
from potentially corrupted measurements. The neural network
architecture is adapted from a unified deep learning framework
shown to efficiently reconstruct a variety of imaging fields [21].
As illustrated in Fig. 2, the input layer FC1 takes a measured
sinogram of  A j ,proj  (6 × 64) of the CH4  rovibrational transi-
tion, reshapes it into a 1 × 384 vector, and then fully connects it
to a 1 × 4096 dimensional hidden layer FC2 with a hyperbolic
tangent activation. This hidden layer FC2 is fully connected to
another hidden layer FC3 with hyperbolic tangent activation,
and is reshaped to a 64 × 64 matrix for convolutional process-
ing. The convolutional layers C1 and C2 convolve 64 filters
of 5 × 5 with stride 1 followed by rectifier nonlinearities. The
final output layer deconvolves the C2 layer with 64 filters of
7 × 7 with stride 1, representing the reconstructed K j  field. The
loss function minimized during training is an L2  mean squared
loss  between  the  network  output  and  the  labeled  K j    fields.
The RMSprop algorithm is used with minibatches of size 50,
learning rate 0.001, momentum 0.0, and decay 0.9. The net-
work was trained for 100 epochs (typically 20–30 mins) on the
Tensorflow deep learning framework using an 8 GB NVIDIA
RTX 2080 graphics card. Via the training process, an effective
inversion operator is learned to predict spatially resolved 2D K j .
This bypasses the numerical inversion of A j ,proj to K j  obtained
through conventional tomography methods.
To  assess  the  predictive  accuracy  of  the  deep  learning
inversion method on a flame pair, the approach is applied to
reconstruct reference simulations of representative 2D K j  fields
using various numbers of projection angles, as shown in Fig. 3.
These  2D  K j    fields  and  their  A j ,proj   projections  are  similar
to but not part of the original training set, and so serve as an
independent reconstruction assessment. Tikhonov-regularized
linear 2D tomography is also applied to the reference fields.
The regularization parameter λ and the smoothing matrix L are
chosen to yield a value of λ that pads the small singular values
but  does  not  overwhelm  the  large  nontrivial  singular  values
[9]. An aggregate root mean square error (RSME) was used as
a comparative metric, calculated as the square root of the aver-
aged squared differences between a reconstructed image and its
corresponding “ground truth” image.
As expected, utilizing a greater number of projection angles
was shown to improve the resolution of peaks and valleys in the
reconstructed  K j   fields for both methods. The deep learning
approach is shown to predict the steep spatial gradients with
equal or greater accuracy (as measured by RMS error) than linear
tomographic methods while concurrently reducing the required
number of projections, even in the cases where the  K j   fields
overlap. Nonphysical absorption artifacts are also observed in
the linear tomographic reconstructions outside of the simulated
reaction zones, a common consequence of the underdetermined
inversion [9]. Notably, the linear tomographic methods show
increasing reconstruction error when the pixel density per flame
structure is reduced, as in the smaller flames in the bottom row
of Fig. 3. The neural network inversion appears less sensitive
to the pixel density, showing a typical reduction in RMSE by a
factor of ∼4−6 relative to corresponding linear tomographic
solutions. We can observe for the experimentally relevant test
case (bottom row), the learning-based approach utilizing three
projection angles has a RSME only 10% greater than the linear
tomographic approach utilizing 12 projection angles.
RESULT
With the deep learning approach tested via simulation, the
neural network inversion was utilized for measurements of the
flame doublets shown in Fig. 1. A distributed feedback (DFB)
interband cascade laser (ICL) near 3.16 µm is used to spectrally
scan across the CH4  R(15) manifold. The beam is expanded
with a concave lens, and expanded again horizontally with a
cylindrical  lens.  The  expanding  beam  is  recollimated  with  a
concave mirror, then pitched through the flow-field comprising
two  Bunsen-style  flames,  each  with  flame  brushes  approxi-
mately 3 mm in diameter. The beam is spectrally isolated with
a bandpass  filter  (Spectrogon, 3160 ± 60 nm),  and  a plano–
convex lens focuses the expanded beam onto the detector array
of the camera. The beam is captured in the camera detector
subwindow of size 64 × 48 with a frame rate of 40 kHz and
integration time of 5 µs. The laser is injection-current tuned
using a sawtooth waveform at 400 Hz, resulting in 100 points
per scan for both I0 and It  for each pixel. The spectrally resolved
absorbance α(ν) is determined using Eq. (1) and is subsequently
fitted using the Voigt line shape model to obtain the projected
absorbance area A j ,proj. For each projection angle measurement,
data are collected at two heights using a vertical translation stage
and later combined after deleting overlapping pixels, yielding
64 × 72 lines of sight to capture the whole flame brush. Each
projection image is collected and averaged over 1 s (400 scan
average), an interval over which the flames are assumed steady.
By imaging a wire mesh with known dimensions backlit with
laser radiation [7], the pixel resolution was determined to be
∼ 70 µm per pixel in the horizontal direction.
The flame pair is mounted on a rotational stage to image
the flow-field from a variety of angles, as shown in Fig. 1. The
partially premixed flames were controlled via thermal mass flow
controllers (MKS MFC GE50A) with combined reactant flow
rates of 150 sccm CH4  and 100 sccm O2. This corresponds
to a fuel-rich mixture with a molar fuel–air equivalence ratio
of φ ≈ 3. After the flows are split to the two burners, one flow
is  measured  with  a  rotameter  to  ensure  equal  flow  through
each burner. The exit velocity of each flow is 0.33 m/s, and the
jet exits of the stainless steel burners are 1.6 mm in diameter,
providing a laminar jet Reynolds number of ∼36.
For each horizontal row of pixels in the measured 2D A j ,proj
images,  the  learning-based  inversion  operator  is  applied  to
predict  the  K j    field  distribution  for  the  R(15)  manifold  of
CH4.  Assembling  the  predictions  for  each  horizontal  row,  a
3D field of K j   is obtained, as shown in Fig. 4. Learning-based
predictions utilizing six projection angles of 2D A j ,proj  images
are shown alongside corresponding results obtained using 2D
linear  tomography.  The  images  are  self-consistent  in  recon-
struction of the twin flames, exhibiting similar heights, widths,
and  magnitudes.  However,  the  flames  diverge  in  magnitude
and  diameter  when  comparing  the  deep  learning  and  linear
tomography results. Steeper spatial gradients of K j  are resolved
within the reacting flow utilizing the learning-based approach,
and this is seen more clearly in the 2D cross sections in the top of
Fig. 4. As in the simulations, the learning-based approach also
mitigates  image  artifacts  and  angular  asymmetry  around  the
flame observed in the results of the linear tomographic method.
Reconstruction performance of both the linear tomography
and neural network inversion is examined in further detail with
1D profiles shown in Fig. 5. The left of Fig. 5 compares 1D
cross-sectional  profiles  of  K j    reconstructions  obtained  from
both linear tomography and deep learning in relation to the
“ground truth” for the simulated K j   field indicated in Fig. 3.
The  uncertainty  shown  associated  with  each  reconstruction
is calculated by performing the reconstructions with different
flow-field orientations [22]. Though a “ground truth” for the
reconstructed K j  fields determined from the experimental mea-
surements is unknown, an analogous comparison can be made
for the experimental K j   fields at the base of the flames nearest
the burner surface, indicated by Fig. 4. Given an independently
measured or estimated temperature field, Eq. (1) can be used
to obtain a mole fraction field for CH4. The right of Fig. 5
shows the resulting 1D profiles of CH4 mole fraction assuming
a  uniform  temperature  of  450  K  (based  on  a  thermocouple
measurement  at  burner  exit).  While  the  temperature  in  this
plane is certainly not uniform, the CH4 absorption line strength
exhibits relative insensitivity to temperature—Error bars cap-
ture  a  possible  temperature  range  between  400  and  750  K.
This simplified analysis provides clear indication that the mole
fraction at the core of the flame (X CH4  ≈ 0.59) is more closely
estimated by the neural network inversion, even with only three
imaging angles.
Additionally, the learning-based approach reduces compu-
tational load compared to linear tomography with Tikhonov
regularization. The reconstructions are more efficient once the
networks are established (20–30 min of training): on an Intel(R)
Core(TM)  i7-9700  K  3.60  GHz  CPU,  the  neural  network
completed reconstructions in 0.35 s while linear tomography
took ∼3 s.
CONCLUSION
A  deep  learning  approach  to  the  inversion  problem  for
absorption  tomography  was  coupled  with  a  high-resolution
LAI for 3D species imaging, and evaluated by simulation and
experiment. To the authors’ knowledge, the experimental effort
represents the first 3D imaging of methane in a flame, attaining
a pixel resolution ∼ 70 µm. Initial results suggest that the neural
network inversion has potential to more accurately predict flame
structures with fewer projection angles than linear tomography,
and reduces computational load. Extension of this method to
more complex flame structures may require more sophisticated
simulations to generate appropriate training data. While the fuel
structures examined here were well-approximated by Gaussian
distributions  (validated  independently  by  single-flame  Abel
inversion), turbulent flow structures and intermediate or prod-
uct fields likely require more physical (and difficult to simulate)
representations.
Experimental and numerical study on the influence of equivalence ratio on key intermediates and silica nanoparticles in flame synthesis
ABSTRACT
Tetramethyl silane is a precursor often used for the production of flame synthesized silica nanoparticles or coatings. This study investigates the chemical reaction mechanism of tetramethyl silane in a series of H2/O2/Ar low pressure (p 30 mbar) flames from fuel lean to slightly fuel rich flame conditions (? 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2). Mole fraction profiles are obtained by molecular beam mass spectrometry. The experimental data are compared to simulations using a recently published reaction mechanism. The present study reveals the influence of the flame composition on the depletion of the precursor TMS, the formation of its main carbon containing products (e.g. CO2 and CO) and the main silicon containing intermediates (e.g. Si(CH3)3(CH2)OO), Si(OH)4, SiO2, Si4O10H4) appearing along the routes of particle formation. TEM images of synthesized particles reveal that the nanoparticles obtained from the gas phase synthesis are spheres with a low degree of agglomeration. The particle size distribution appears to be dependent on the equivalence ratio of the synthesis flames and the changes can tentatively be traced to different particle formation pathways. The data set provided in this work can serve a basis for improvements to the reaction mechanisms of the Si/C/H/O system that are urgently needed to improve particle synthesis processes.
INTRODUCTION
Silica nanoparticles are useful materials for advanced medical and pharmaceutical applications e.g. biosensing, or drug delivery. To enable the synthesis of nanoparticles with properties, e.g. size distributions, adequate for the respective application, the fundamentals of the synthesis process must be understood. They include the precursor decomposition in the flame, interaction of precursor and intermediates with flame species and the influence of the flame conditions on the particle properties. Although, many studies were carried out with different silicon containing precursors, the exact reaction mechanisms leading to the formation of silica nanoparticles from the intermediates are still unclear. Britten et al. developed one of the first reaction mechanisms for silane combustion consisting of 25 species and 70 reactions. Miller et al. extended the reaction mechanism to 58 Si containing species and 201 reactions. These include a reaction path for silane combustion starting from SiH3 O2 and the first steps towards silica cluster formation from SiO.
Feroughi et al. studied hexamethyl disiloxane (HMDSO) doped flames by measuring SiO profiles via laser induced fluorescence and postulated SiO as an important species for the silica cluster formation in flames. Chrystie et al. investigated the impact of precursor load on the SiO concentrations. Shekar et al. emphasized the relevance of Si(OH)4 monomers in the gas phase for the formation of nanoparticles and based a detailed population balance model for the aerosol synthesis of silica nanoparticles from tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) on this hypothesis.
Nurkowski et al. proposed a detailed chemical reaction mechanism for the pyrolysis of TEOS, reduced it to a skeletal chemical mechanism and validated it for a hydrogen oxygen flame. Various computational studies on high temperature oxidation of TEOS postulate Si(OH)4 as one of the most relevant silicon species over a wide range of the temperatures.
Recently, a detailed reaction mechanism for the destruction of tetramethyl silane (TMS) combustion was developed by Janbazi et al.. Based on numerous experimental data and in particularly on molecular beam mass spectrometry data of TMS oxidation in hydrogen flames, a TMS sub-mechanism consisting of 28 reactions and 24 Si containing species was incorporated into the C1 mechanism proposed by Li et al.. The transport data and thermodynamic properties of SiCH and Si COH containing species are taken from literature. Rate coefficients were estimated either by analogy to the hydro carbon chemistry, by Rice每Ramsperger每Kassel每 Marcus calculations or by an optimization engine based on genetic algorithms with the flame data as optimization targets. The performance of the mechanism was further evaluated with flames of the same equivalence ratio doped with 400 and 800 ppm of TMS, which show that different doping leads to different mole fractions of intermediates in the experiments without changing the overall reaction pathways in the flames. The next step to improve the reaction mechanism further, is the evaluation if it can reproduce the interaction between precursor and flame chemistry correctly. One way to test the influence of different oxygen, water, and radical mole fractions on the reaction pathways of TMS oxidation, is to change the equivalence ratio of the flames. The work reported here provides the validation data necessary for this development step and compares new experimental data with simulations of the different flame conditions using the mechanism of Janbazi et al.
METHOD
The formation of main flame species (H2, O2, H2O, Ar, O) and the decomposition of the precursor to intermediate species e.g. TMS, Si(CH3)3(CH2)OO, SiO2, Si(OH)4, Si4O10H4, CO2, CO are monitored in laminar H2/O2/Ar low pressure flames by means of molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). Details on the experiment, the data analysis and uncertainties of the mole fractions can be found in Karakaya et al. and only a brief description is given here. All low pressure flames are stabilized on a matrix burner with a diameter of 36 mm installed in a reactor with a pressure of 30 0.03 mbar. Flame conditions are listed in Table 1. The burner position can be changed in upwards flow direction relative to the quartz sampling probe between HAB 0每 100 mm (HAB, height above burner) with an accuracy of 0.01 mm. A throttle valve maintains the pressure in the reactor chamber at 30 mbar with an accuracy of 0.1%. A molecular beam is formed by extraction of a gas sample from the reactor chamber through a 90 米m orifice in the tip of a conical quartz sampling probe into a second vacuum stage with a pressure of 10?3 mbar. The molecular beam passes through a skimmer with an orifice diameter of 1.2 mm into the ionization chamber of an orthogonal time of flight mass spectrometer (TOF). The nominal kinetic energy of the electrons used for electron ionization is 17 eV in order to detect the major species products (e.g. H2, O2, H2O, TMS, CO2, CO, O, Si species and 70 eV to see silicon containing clusters (e.g. Si4O10H4) with low concentrations in the flames. 107 mass spectra are summed to obtain sufficient sensitivity for the detection of mole fractions in the x 10?6 range. Each integrated mass peak is proportional to the mole fraction of the respective species in the gas sample weighted by the ionization efficiency of the substance. The TOF has a resolution of m/ilm 3000 at a mass to charge ratio of m/z 28, which is useful for peaks with near identical m/z. The settings were optimized to see the decomposition of the precursor and the subsequent formation of the most relevant small gaseous clusters below m/z 400. TMS was metered with a syringe pump with an accuracy of 2 vol% and evaporated at 333 K. Thermal mass flow controllers regulate the gas flows with an accuracy of 5%. The inside and the outside of the burner matrix were not coated significantly with SiO2, so it can be concluded that TMS starts to decompose in the flame and a significant change in burner porosity is not expected.
The errors of the presented mole fractions depend on the calibration procedure and range between 15% for major species (O2, H2, H2O), 30每 60% for minor intermediate species and TMS, and a factor of two for flame radicals (e.g. O) and silicon containing intermediates. The temperature profiles of flames AH were measured with a thermocouple and are radiation corrected according to the method of Bahlawane et al. The uncertainty of the temperature measurement is evaluated to be 100 K. Additionally, the relative perturbed temperature profile is evaluated from the temperature dependence of the argon signal as described by Struckmeier et al. These temperature profiles include the influence of the nozzle and will be used for the simulations of flames A每H. Synthesized particles are collected from a filter in the exhaust line of the flame reactor under ambient conditions after a sequence of experiments with different equivalence ratio in order to characterize the particle morphology. Nanoparticles are mechanically deposited onto copper TEM grids with lacey carbon films without any solvents. Investigations are performed using a JEOL JEM2200FS TEM instrument and ImageJ software to obtain the nanoparticle size distribution by analysis of measured diameters of more than 500 particles from the sample. The x ray diffraction pattern is obtained using a P analytical XP? ert Pro diffractometer.
For the simulations of flames AH, the detailed reaction mechanism together with transport and thermodynamic properties published by Janbazi et al. is used for one dimensional simulations of the low pressure laminar flames with the measured perturbed temperature profiles (see Fig. 1a) using Cantera and ChemKin Pro 19.2. ChemKin Pro 19.2 is used for the detailed re action flow analyses.
RESULT and DISCUSSION
Figure 1a compares the temperature profiles of the doped and the undoped flames with different equivalence ratios. The maximum temperature is almost identical in the neat and doped flames of identical equivalence ratio, but the temperatures in the reaction zone are about 100 K higher. The temperature decrease in the exhaust gas is less pronounced in the doped flames. Both observations, can be explained by exothermic reactions of TMS oxidation close to the burner and exothermic hydrolysis re actions of silicon containing intermediates in the exhaust gas. Fig. 1(b每f) shows measured and simulated main species profiles for the systematic change of equivalence ratios (?) between is included. The simulated and measured mole fraction profiles of the main species H2, O2, H2O are in a very good agreement. Small deviations occur close to the burner surface. These can be traced for all species to the influence of the burner sur face and the quartz probe on the flame structure as discussed before, e.g., in a study of Deng et al. The hydrogen and oxygen are consumed in the reaction zone of the flame and reach equilibrium values around HAB 15 mm in all flames. Water also reaches an equilibrium value at the same HAB. TMS is consumed completely at HAB 10 mm (see Fig. 1f). As a consequence, the TMS consumption occurs at very different flame conditions for the flames of different equivalence ratios. The oxygen mole fraction is approximately 50% higher, the hydrogen mole fraction is 30% lower, and the water mole fraction differs by 40% between the flames with ? 0.6 and ? 1.2 in the TMS destruction region. The profiles of the other equivalence ratios fall between the profiles of the flames with the largest and smallest equivalence ratio. The flame temperatures rise at HAB 10 mm to 1000 K for all doped flames. It can be observed that the addition of TMS shifts all main species profiles closer to the burner surface as a result of the temperature rise in the reaction zone. Deviations between simulation and experiment concerning TMS are extensively discussed in the work of Janbazi et al]. In summary, the decomposition steps of TMS are estimated by analogy to the hydrocarbon chemistry of neopentane and were not optimized against the experimental profiles during model development. Also, probing effects can affect the flow field and temperature field. This results in widening the flame front and cooling the flame close to the sampling probe. The effect of the sampling probe on the flame temperature and the resulting changes to the flame structure are tentatively shown in the Supplementary Material Fig. S3. Figure 2 shows the measured and simulated mole fraction profiles of the oxygen radicals in the reported flames. The measured O radical profiles have comparatively large uncertainties and exhibit more noise than the profiles of other intermediates because the small radicals OH and O are often lost in the sampling process. According to the simulation the oxygen radical is involved in many re actions with intermediate species of TMS. As expected, the mole fraction of the O radical is higher at lean than at rich flame conditions. Compared to flame B it decreases by 20%, 38%, 55% in the exhaust gas of flames D, F, and H, respectively.  For all equivalence ratios, the maximum O radical mole fraction is reached downstream of the point of complete decomposition of TMS and is followed by a slow consumption of O radicals in the exhaust gas. The deviations in the O consumption rates between doped and undoped flames can be traced by reaction path analyses and sensitivity analyses to the reaction between CO and O forming CO2. The model overpredicts this difference for the lean conditions
Most likely, either the dependence of this re action on the equivalence ratio is not accurately captured in the model or reactions with silicon containing species, which are not included in the model, contribute markedly to the consumption of O radicals under lean conditions.
The comparison of measured and simulated TMS profiles in Fig. 1f reveals significant deviations. The simulated mole fraction profiles show a convex down behavior and the experiments a convex up behavior, for all equivalence ratios. The difference in profile shape can be explained by the effect of the sampling probe on the flow and temperature field of the flame. In addition, the simulations predict a much faster TMS destruction than observed in the experiments, that was also observed in the original reaction mechanism development work. TMS destruction is dominated by hydrogen abstraction reactions from TMS by O, H and OH radicals as can be seen from the rate of production analysis (ROP) in Fig. 3. ROP analyses were performed at HAB 1 mm, 2.5 mm and 6 mm. The rate coefficient for the hydrogen abstraction from TMS by H radicals is among the few rate coefficients in the Si/C/H/O system that has been accurately measured by Peukert et al. The rate coefficients for the hydrogen abstraction by other radicals have been estimated with reasonable ac curacy based on analogies of H abstraction from neopentane. These reaction rates were not changed in the reaction mechanism optimization. The reactions with OH and H radicals contribute strongly to the decomposition of TMS for equivalence ratios investigated here, while the reaction with O radicals plays only a minor role. The importance of the H abstraction by H radicals increases with increasing equivalence ratios in agreement with the larger H radical mole fractions, while importance of the reaction with OH radicals is unaffected. The fact that the overestimation of the reaction rate of TMS in the experiments is also independent of the flame conditions, e.g., independent of mole fractions of O, H and OH radicals, suggests that the discrepancies in the TMS consumption rate are most likely linked to the H abstraction reaction by OH radicals. Figure 1e presents measured and simulated mole fraction profiles of the CO2 and CO formed during oxidation of the TMS. The carbon mono x ide profiles peak around HAB 10 mm, so at the same HAB where all TMS is consumed. In all flames, the CO is further oxidized to CO2 reach ing equilibrium values close to 2400 ppm. Carbon is only introduced into the gas mixture by the TMS addition (2400 ppm). From the carbon balance, it is evident that all carbon is converted to CO and subsequently CO2 at high HAB, which is desirable in the synthesis of ultrapure silicon oxide particles. The simulation reproduces the measured CO2 and CO mole fraction profiles quite well, but deviations appear close to the burner due probe perturbations. Deviations between measured and simulated CO2 mole fractions at higher distances are slightly larger than the expected error limit of 15%. They can be explained by a stream stall of the one dimensional flow field leading to a source for further perturbations.
The comparison of the experimental and simulated mole fraction values demonstrates that the reaction mechanism reproduces the overall flame chemistry with and without addition of TMS well. This is a prerequisite for further analysis and interpretation of observations using the simulations.
Figure 4 shows two reaction path analyses at HAB 10 mm and HAB 20 mm for ? 1 at temperatures of 1013 K and 1250 K. They show that only the relative importance of the reaction path ways changes with HAB, while the active pathways are identical. Similar reaction pathways were found for all equivalence ratios.
Since Si(CH3)3CH2 could not be detected,  the first experimentally observed silicon containing intermediate at all equivalence ratios is Si(CH3)3CH2OO. This species may be a peroxide or one of its more stable isomers. In the reaction mechanism the peroxide Si(CH3)3CH2OO is produced by O2 addition to the initially formed TMS radical. The maxima of the mole fraction profiles of Si(CH3)3CH2OO move to slightly larger distances from the burner with decreasing equivalence ratio. This trend and the absolute mole fraction profiles shown in Fig. 5 are in good agreement between experiment and simulation, and in accord with the shifts i the temperature profiles (Fig. 1a). Also, the mole fraction of Si(CH3)3CH2OO increases with increasing amount of O2. For all equivalence ratios, Si(CH3)3CH2OO is completely consumed at around 700 K. Other silicon intermediate species, e.g., OSi(CH3)3, Si(CH3)3OH, Si(OH)3 appear in the reaction zone as it is postulated in the reaction pathway in Fig. 4.
Figure 6a reports measured and simulated mole fraction profiles of SiO2, Si(OH)4, Si4O10H4 that are important intermediates of particle formation in the reaction pathway in Fig. 4. These species are formed from the initial intermediates and peak at HAB 10 mm. According to the reaction mechanism, two distinct pathways lead to the formation of silica nanoparticles. The first pathway forms SiO, which condenses to SiO2 nanoparticles. Condensation of Si(OH)4 to larger clusters such as Si4O10H4 which in turn form silica nanoparticles constitutes the second pathway.
The measured and simulated mole fraction pro files of SiO2 in Fig. 6a have their maxima near HAB 10 mm at 1000 K. SiO2 is consumed slowly in the exhaust gas. The maximum mole fractions of SiO2 decrease with increasing equivalence ratio and reach the detection limit in the richest flame H. The simulations predict the measured profiles within the accuracy of the data. According to the reaction path analysis at ? 1 and HAB 10 mm SiO2 is mainly formed by the reaction SiO O2 SiO2 O, so consequently less SiO2 is formed with increasing equivalence ratio because less oxygen is available in the exhaust. It is conceivable that as a consequence more SiO could react to nanoparticles.
Figure 6b presents measured and simulated mole fraction profiles of Si(OH)4. The simulation captures the measurements within the absolute un certainties of the data. Species like Si(OH)4 are quantified using estimated ionization efficiencies and have large absolute uncertainties of a factor of two. In addition, the model was optimized in the work of Janbazi et al., to fit the absolute mole fractions in flame B, so that a good match of experiment and simulation is expected. When comparing profiles from different equivalence ratios, the uncertainties in the ionization efficiency can be neglected because they will shift the mole fraction values in the same direction.
At the maximum of the Si(OH)4 profiles at ap proximately HAB 10 mm, the experimental mole fractions of the cluster Si4O10H4 are about 40% lower in flame B (?  0.6) compared to flame H (? 1.2), reflecting the decrease in the respective Si(OH)4 profiles quantitatively. This observation confirms, that independent of the equivalence ratio of the flame the formation of Si4O10H4 is linked directly to Si(OH)4.
In conclusion, the model describes the effect of equivalence ratio on important species in the particle formation path correctly and can be used to estimate the relative importance of both pathways as a function of equivalence ratio.
The nanoparticles can be formed either via the SiO or via the Si4H10O4cluster route shown in Fig. 4. According to a rate of production analysis at ? 1 at HAB 10 mm, the ROP of nanoparticles by the SiO pathway is 105 time higher than the ROP by the cluster pathway. At HAB 20 mm the cluster pathway is more important with a 104 times higher ROP. This observation indicates that the pathway for the formation of nanoparticles changes within the flame with increasing HAB. The relative importance of both pathways in the complete synthesis process is estimated by comparison of the integrated ROP for both routes over all HAB. This analysis shows that 97% of the particles are formed via the SiO route and 3% are formed via the Si4O10H4 cluster route.
Compared to the study of hydrocarbon systems the investigation of inorganic nanoparticle formation in flames is considerably more difficult, e.g., due to the lack of any prior knowledge of the species occurring in theses flames, unknown species properties and the more rapid particle formation which presents a technical challenge. Consequently, the presented data are state of theart but do not reach the accuracy that can be achieved in hydrocarbon systems. The study presented here is the only systematic speciation study of the Si/H/O system reaching this level of chemical detail in the literature. As a result, the chemical reaction mechanism trained on these data is currently an ※engineering model§ with a majority of optimized rate constants [11]. However, the change in nanoparticle formation pathways observed is significant and outside the error margin.
If a change in particle formation pathways occurs as function of equivalence ratio, this effect should be evident in the synthesized nanoparticles. The particle sizes could not be determined online in the experiment described here, but the particle properties were investigated with offline techniques. Silica powders are collected after a series of measurements with the three flames D, F and H of different equivalence ratio. Consequently, the powders are a mixture of the nanoparticles produced with different oxygen flows. 8 TEM images are used and 511 particles are counted to obtain a representative and statistically significant nanoparticle size distribution. Figure 7 shows a particle size distribution of silica nanoparticles. A lognormal fit of the data clearly shows a bimodal size distribution with two fractions of particles with mean diameters of
46.7 nm and 158 nm.
Changes to the size distribution have previously been observed in flame synthesis by Akurati et al.
who measured the BET based nanoparticle diameter of silicon oxides depending on the oxygen flow rate. The inset of Fig. 7 shows a representative TEM micrograph of the spherical particles. The amorphous lattice of the particles is supported by a Xray diffraction investigation with a broad feature at 25∼ 2牟 typically for amorphous SiO2 (see Supplemental Figs. S1 and S2).
The data support the observation that the equivalence ratio seems to affect the final particle size but not the particle structure. The flame data of ferseveral possible explanations for the observed effect. On the one hand, the different particle sizes may be related to the different particle formation pathways. On the other hand, the changes in the mole fractions of the radicals in the exhaust gas may lead to different growth patterns of the initially formed nanoparticles. These open questions will be addressed in future research.
CONCLUSION
This work investigates the influence of the equivalence ratio of H2/O2/Ar synthesis flames on the reaction pathways of tetramethyl silane, inter mediates and nanoparticles. Mole fraction profiles of the most important species are compared to simulations with a reaction mechanism for TMS combustion from literature. The results demonstrate that the reaction mechanism can be improved by more accurate rate coefficients for the hydrogen abstraction by OH radicals from TMS, and by inclusion of reactions of silicon containing species with the flame radicals in the exhaust gas. Nevertheless, the reaction mechanism reproduces the experimental data with satisfactory accuracy for all equivalence ratios. In particular, it is shown that two nanoparticle formation pathways are active at all equivalence ratios and that they may lead to different particle size distributions. The data set can be further used to improve reaction kinetics in the Si/C/H/O system.
High-pressure,  high-temperature  optical  cell  for  mid-infrared spectroscopy 
Abstract 
The design, characterization, and operation of a new high-temperature, high-pressure optical cell for in- 
frared spectroscopy is presented. The optical cell uses 16 cm CaF 2 window rods to penetrate the tem- 
perature gradient between the heated optical path length and the ambient conditions surrounding the 
system. Along the 21.3 cm optical path length, good temperature uniformity was measured with devia- 
tions being less than 2.4% of the mean absolute temperature. Further characterization of the optical cell 
revealed usable transmission up to ∼8 μm and pressure stability from vacuum to over 30 atm. More- 
over, stable operation of the optical cell during simultaneous heating and pressurization to 800 K and 
over 30 atm was demonstrated. To illustrate the utility of the new facility, high-resolution measurements 
of the R-branch in the fundamental absorption band of nitric oxide near 5.2 μm were collected at several 
pressures (1-34 atm) and temperatures (294–802 K) using an external cavity quantum cascade laser. The 
measured spectra were compared with Voigt line shape simulations using the HITRAN/HITEMP databases. 
At high gas densities, deviations from the Voigt line shape model are observed, emphasizing the need to 
further study infrared molecular spectra at high temperatures and pressures. 
1. Introduction 
Laboratory  measurements  of  high-pressure,  high-temperature 
molecular  spectra  are  desirable  for  their  utility  in  combustion 
sensors  [1] ,  planetary  atmospheric  study  [2–4] ,  predicting  ra- 
diative  heat  transfer,  chemical  sensing  in  industrial  processes 
[5,6] , and sensing for other gas phase systems [7–9] . To that end, 
high-pressure (5–100 atm)  and  high-temperature (650–2500 K) 
spectroscopy has been performed in short-duration ( ∼ms) shock 
tube experiments [8,10–12] . In these experiments, typically only a 
few wavelength regions are studied at a time as traditional wide 
spectrum devices (e.g. FTIR) cannot complete a measurement in 
this time frame. Resolving full absorption bands or branches in 
conditions generated behind reflected shock waves in shock tube 
experiments  has  proven  difficult  until  a  recent  demonstration 
by  Strand  et  al.  using  a  new  rapid-tuning,  broad-scan  ECQCL 
measured  the  absorption  cross  sections  of  ethylene  and  other 
molecules in the 8.5–11.7 μm region [13] . 
The  spectroscopy  literature  contains  numerous  descriptions 
of spectroscopic cells whose achievable temperature or pressure 
conditions  overlap  with  the  range  of  conditions  achieved  in 
shock  tube  experiments.  However,  simultaneously  heated  and 
pressurized spectroscopic cells are relatively rare in the literature, 
particularly in the mid-infrared (IR) region beyond 5 μm. Adding 
this capability yields a more convenient, repeatable, and econom- 
ical  means  to  measure  new  spectra,  test  current  spectroscopic 
models and databases, and to calibrate sophisticated tunable diode 
laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) sensors. 
In  this  paper,  we  present  the  design  and  construction  of  a 
high-pressure, high-temperature optical cell (HPHT) designed for 
mid-infrared spectroscopy via unique calcium fluoride (CaF 2 ) win- 
dow rods. The maximum operating conditions successfully demon- 
strated by the HPHT were simultaneous heating and pressurization 
to 800 K and over 30 atmospheres. Furthermore, the temperature 
non-uniformity of the cell is shown to be no greater than 2.4% 
of the mean absolute temperature across the entire path length, 
and the leak rate is insignificant in comparison to the data col- 
lection time of a typical TDLAS system. To demonstrate and vali- 
date the reported conditions, high-pressure and high-temperature 
laser absorption spectra of nitric oxide (NO) measured in the HPHT 
optical cell are presented and compared to simulations calculated 
from the HITRAN [14] and HITEMP [15] databases. Evidence of col- 
lisional effects beyond Lorentzian-type broadening are observed at 
sufficiently high gas densities. These effects further emphasize the 
need for facilities to perform high-temperature and high-pressure 
spectroscopic experiments. 
2. Absorption spectroscopy fundamentals 
Laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) is a well-known technique 
used to study molecular structure, and it is also utilized in sensors 
to  measure  the  concentration  of  particular  gaseous  species  as 
well as their temperature, pressure, and even bulk velocity for 
applications in combustion, propulsion, and hypersonics [1,16] . The 
main advantages of LAS are its relatively simple operation in its 
most basic form and its versatility especially in advanced variants 
such as wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) [10–12,17] . 
The IR wavelength regions are of particular interest because un- 
known molecules can be identified from absorption at different 
wavelengths correlating to the bonds and functional groups of the 
molecules. Furthermore, the strong fundamental absorption bands 
of common combustion species (H 2 O, CO 2 , and CO) are found in 
the mid-IR and are becoming increasingly utilized in sensor de- 
signs as mid-IR light sources and optics continue to improve [16] . 
The absorption of monochromatic light is defined by the Beer–
Lambert Law [18] 
which relates the ratio of transmitted to incident light,  II 0 , the 
spectral absorbance, αν, which is the product of the spectral ab- 
sorption coefficient at frequency ν, k ν, and the path length of the 
absorbing medium, L . For an isolated absorption transition, j , the 
spectral absorption coefficient can be further defined                                   
where S is the line strength of the isolated transition, φ is the line 
shape function of the isolated transition, T is the absolute temper- 
ature, P is the absolute pressure, and X i is the mole fraction of the 
absorbing species i . The line shape is often described by the Voigt 
line shape function, which is the convolution of Gaussian ( φD ) and 
Lorentzian ( φL ) line shapes. 
The Gaussian line shape is a manifestation of the velocity distribu- 
tion of the absorbing molecules and their associated distribution 
of Doppler shifts, also known as Doppler broadening. Lorentzian 
line shapes are manifestations of lifetime broadening of energy 
states of the absorption transition; examples are natural broaden- 
ing which is the result of spontaneous emission from the upper 
and lower states of the transition and collision broadening which 
alters the lifetime of a molecule in an energy state via energy ex- 
changes during collisions with other molecules. In many situations, 
Doppler and collision broadening dominate the line shape, neces- 
sitating proper modeling of these two broadening mechanisms for 
use in LAS-based sensors. 
The Doppler broadening line shape can be determined ana- 
lytically from the vacuum frequency of the absorbing transition, 
the molecular weight of the absorbing molecule, and the absolute 
temperature. The collision broadening line shape depends on the 
collision partners present in the gas mixture, the pressure, and the 
temperature. These dependencies are summed up in Eqs. (4) and 
where νC is the collision broadening full width at half maximum 
(FWHM), γB −A is the pressure broadening coefficient of absorbing 
molecule B with collision partner A, T 0 is the reference tempera- 
ture (typically 296 K or 10 0 0 K for high-temperature applications), 
and n is the temperature dependence exponent. While analytical 
collision models exist, 2 γ  and n are usually determined empir- 
ically for each absorbing molecule and collision partner. In fact, 
determination of these collision parameters for different absorbing 
molecules over a range of conditions is a primary motivator for 
the development of the HPHT. 
The  previous  discussion  on  fundamental  absorption  spec- 
troscopy  of  isolated  transitions  is  necessary  to  understand 
collisional  effects  on  molecular  spectra.  As  pressure  increases, 
typically νC follows. At moderate pressures, isolated transitions 
begin overlapping, and typically a superposition of transition line 
shapes sufficiently describes the observed spectrum. As a result, 
a summation over all transitions must be added to the definition 
presented in Eq. (2) . 
At yet higher pressures, the spectrum loses its discrete nature in 
favor of a continuum. Thus, TDLAS sensors designed to operate 
at  high  pressures  require  accurate  knowledge  of  the  spectral 
parameters for all transitions with significant contributions to the 
absorption coefficient at the sensor’s optical frequency. However, 
additional collision effects such as line mixing and the breakdown 
of the impact approximation bring complications beyond the Voigt 
profile and can introduce significant errors between measured and 
simulated absorbance in both the peaks and wings of individual 
transitions and the entire band [17,19,20] . Facilities such as the 
high-pressure,  high-temperature  optical  cell  described  here  are 
essential to better understand these phenomena as a function of 
various thermodynamic conditions. 
3. Previous experimental facilities and studies 
A  number  of  experimental  facilities  have  been  reported  for 
the study of high-pressure and/or high-temperature spectroscopy 
of  various  gaseous  species.  For  the  purposes  of  improving  the 
knowledge of NO radiation transport, Green and Tien performed 
measurements of low-resolution NO spectra in a static cell capable 
of reaching temperatures up to 1200 K and pressures up to 4 atm 
[21] . The cell body was constructed of a zirconia ceramic tube 
placed in a high-temperature furnace, and the windows protruded 
to the more uniform central zone of the furnace via nitrogen- 
cooled  stainless  steel  tubes  mounted  with  sapphire  windows. 
Temperature uniformity was found to be acceptable as the tem- 
peratures measured at the nitrogen-cooled windows and 1.5 cm 
from the windows were 20% and 4% lower, respectively, than the 
center temperature of the furnace [22] . 
Motivated  by  TDLAS  sensor  development  for  high-pressure 
combustion, Reiker et al. studied high-pressure, high-temperature 
water vapor spectroscopy near 7204 and 7435 cm −1 in a static 
cell that demonstrated operation up to 30 atm at 700 K [17] . The 
window design used a tapered window housing mounted with a 
matching tapered sapphire window that was compressed between 
two copper seals by a compression nut. The entire cell was placed 
in a uniform single-zone furnace, requiring the window seal to 
survive all operating pressures and temperatures. The Inconel body 
of the optical cell presented in this paper is similar to Reiker’s cell 
body except with modifications made for the new window design. 
More recently, Stefani et al. studied the spectrum of CO 2 from 
60 0 0 to 10,0 0 0 cm −1 (1–1.67 μm) at pressures and temperatures 
up to 20 atm and 560 K, respectively [23] . The reported con- 
ditions were obtained in a commercial stainless steel (316) op- 
tical cell capable of withstanding pressures up to 200 bar and 
temperatures  up  to  650  K.  The  2  cm  optical  path  length  cell 
used zinc sulfide (ZnS) windows which have good transmission up 
to 12 μm. 
Another example of sapphire’s utilization for high-temperature, 
high-pressure  spectroscopy  was  reported  by  Christiansen  et  al. 
who built and demonstrated an optical cell whose operation range 
reached  simultaneous  heating  to  10 0 0  K  and  pressurization  to 
100 atm [24] . The cell body was made of concentric, high-grade 
aluminum oxide ceramic tubes, and the 3 mm thin sapphire win- 
dows were glass-bonded to the internal ceramic tubes to form a 
seal. A central heating coil heated the 3 cm optical path length 
and was supplemented by two more heating coils on either side 
to form a highly uniform path length. 
A high-temperature, low pressure static cell with excellent tem- 
perature uniformity at 1723 K was reported by Melin and Sanders 
with sample high-temperature spectra of water vapor presented 
[25] . This particular architecture also used concentric alumina ce- 
ramic tubes to form the cell body. The windows were made from 
sapphire tubes  with optically contacted sapphire windows that 
formed a seal on the process side. The optical path length of this 
cell was reported to be changeable, but for the demonstration pre- 
sented a path length of 16 cm was used. 
In many of the designs, penetration across the temperature gra- 
dient from ambient temperatures to the uniform, high-temperature 
zone was achieved, in one way or another, by mounting optical 
windows to the end of a window mount that protrudes into the 
center zone of a high-temperature furnace. For the applications 
discussed, sapphire’s high strength and resistance to thermal stress 
makes it the best solution. However, a limitation of sapphire is 
that its usable transmission range is limited to ∼ 6 μm (depending 
on  the  thickness),  and  to  complicate  matters  the  transmission 
cut-off wavelength  of  sapphire  shortens  as  its  temperature  in- 
creases  [26] .  This limits the number of species and conditions 
available  for  spectroscopic  investigation,  particularly  for  hydro- 
carbons and even NO if the window is too thick. Other window 
materials with longer transmission like ZnS, ZnSe, and the fluoride 
crystals (CaF 2 , BaF 2 , MgF 2 ) have their own design challenges (e.g. 
brittleness, thermal stress, lower maximum temperature stability), 
but  are  necessary  to  extend  the  transmission  range  of  static 
cells. 
The pressures reached by the optical cells described in this 
section  are  representative  of  combustion  engine  pressures,  yet 
there is a drive to reach higher temperatures and longer wave- 
lengths. The need for spectroscopic studies at higher temperatures 
is clear in that combustion temperatures can easily exceed 20 0 0 K. 
The  need  for  measurements  of  high-temperature  and  pressure 
spectra  at  longer  wavelengths  is  evident  in  pyrolysis  kinetics. 
Recent combustion kinetics studies indicate that fuel fragments 
from  pyrolysis  have  a  pronounced  effect  on  oxidation  kinetics 
[27] . Beyond the C –H stretch near 3 μm, a number of hydrocarbon 
(i.e. fuel fragment) identifiers are present in the mid to far-IR. 
Accurate spectroscopic databases of pyrolysis fuel fragments can 
improve time-resolved species measurements during pyrolysis and 
combustion processes. Such measurements significantly improve 
combustion models. In addition to combustion applications, mea- 
surements of the mid-IR spectra of many molecules over a variety 
of conditions up to 40 0 0 K and 10 0 bar are of interest for the study 
of exoplanetary atmospheres [2] . The present optical cell provides 
a  stable  environment  to  study  the  spectra  of  many  molecules 
up  to  ∼8  μm  in  a  wide  range  of  relevant  thermodynamic 
conditions. 
4. Design of the high-pressure, high-temperature optical cell 
The high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) optical cell was 
initially designed for infrared spectroscopy of gases at high pres- 
sures  and  temperatures  up  to  900  K.  In  previous  works,  such 
conditions were reached using shock tube or static cell facilities 
with windows made with robust optical materials such as sapphire 
or  fused  quartz.  The  diminishing  transmission  of  longer  wave- 
length light through these materials is problematic for infrared 
spectroscopy  as  sapphire’s  transmission  begins  to  cut  off near 
4.5  μm  and  fused  quartz’s  near  3.5  μm.  Infrared  spectroscopy 
at  longer  wavelengths  requires  use  of  window  materials  with 
superior  transmission  properties.  At  room  temperature,  use  of 
materials such as zinc selenide, calcium fluoride, barium fluoride, 
or germanium for infrared optics is common. Unfortunately, many 
of  these  infrared  optical  materials  are  much  less  robust  than 
sapphire or fused quartz and are more susceptible to a variety 
of failure modes at elevated temperatures such as thermal shock, 
oxidation, and opacity [28–30] . Although a compromise in trans- 
mission wavelength range (up to  ∼8 μm) compared to other IR 
materials, calcium fluoride (CaF 2 ) presents a stable alternative at 
high-temperatures when care is used to prevent damage due to 
thermal stress or exposure to moisture [29,30] . Additionally, CaF 2 ’s 
low index of refraction mitigates back-reflection problems other 
high index materials may cause. Thus, CaF 2 was selected as the 
window material for the HPHT. 
The body of the HPHT is made from Inconel 625 high-pressure 
fittings (High Pressure Equipment Co.); its geometry and dimen- 
sions are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . SAE ports were machined into 
the boss fittings at either end of the HPHT and are where the 
window  assembly  and  o-ring  sit  to  form  a  vacuum  tight  seal. 
Inlet and outlet tubes at opposite end of the optical cell provide 
flexibility in setting up a flow configuration. The HPHT body sits 
in a 40 cm wide single-zone tube furnace (Barnstead|Thermolyne 
21100 Tube Furnace) that provides the primary heating load and 
insulation.  Additional  high-temperature  insulation  is  added  to 
cover the exposed ends of the metal body. Before being placed in 
the tube furnace, the HPHT was fitted with a stainless steel sheath 
that is used to translate a long K-type thermocouple along the 
HPHT to measure the temperature at different points along the op- 
tical axis. In this configuration, the HPHT temperature distribution 
was found to be unacceptably non-uniform for spectroscopy mea- 
surements (see Fig. 3 ). To overcome the non-uniform path length, 
high-temperature  band  heaters  (Watlow)  were  secured  around 
the center tube of the cell body (see Fig. 1 ). Independent control 
was provided by temperature controllers (Omega CN7533) with 
feedback from type-K thermocouples placed at the band heater 
locations. Fig. 3 shows the improved temperature uniformity of 
the HPHT with the band heaters. 
The  window  design  consists  of  three  components;  namely, 
the window housing, the window, and the sealing adhesive. To 
minimize coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch with 
CaF 2 , aluminum SAE plugs were selected for the threaded window 
housings that mated with the SAE ports on the cell body. The 
plugs  were  given  a  clear  aperture  of  1  cm  for  optical  access. 
Although the band heaters dramatically improved the uniformity 
of a 22 cm region in the center of the furnace, a large temperature 
gradient exists between the band heater and the window housing 
locations.  To  penetrate  the  temperature  gradient,  16  cm  long, 
1.168 cm diameter CaF 2 rods are used as the window material, 
creating a gas path length of 21.3 cm between the internal faces 
of the CaF 2 rods. The internal faces of the CaF 2 rods are wedged 
to 1 ◦  to mitigate etalons due to constructive and deconstructive 
interference of the laser beam intensity. Two adhesive materials 
were examined to bond the CaF 2 rods to the aluminum window 
housings.  A  high-temperature  epoxy  selected  for  its  close  CTE 
match with CaF 2  and aluminum proved to be unsuitable as it 
cured  significantly  harder  and  stronger  than  the  CaF 2  crystal. 
After curing and upon installation into the HPHT cell, the CaF 2 
rod  fractured  near  the  bonding  location  when  applying  torque 
to  the  SAE  window  fitting.  A  successful  alternative  was  found 
in  a  low-outgassing  silicone  adhesive  (ACC  Adhesives  AS1724) 
with a maximum working temperature of 200 ◦C. Despite a larger 
difference  in  CTE  compared  to  CaF 2 ,  the  softer,  more  elastic 
silicone adhesive has continued to seal under many heating and 
pressurization cycles. To further combat thermal stress at the bond 
location, the boss ends of the HPHT were cooled by water-chilled 
copper coil collars (see Fig. 1 ). With the HPHT temperature set to 
900 K, the temperature at the bond location was measured to be 
less than 80 ◦C, well within the adhesive’s limits. 
5. Characteristics of the HPHT cell 
5.1. Transmission 
Depending on the sample thickness and data source, the re- 
ported optical transmission of CaF 2 crosses 10% between roughly 
8–13 μm (900–1250 cm −1 ) [28,31] . Since the CaF 2 rods used for 
the HPHT are much longer than the specimens typically measured 
in the literature, the authors felt it was worthwhile to measure 
the transmission spectrum to better understand the limits of the 
facility and to plan future experiments. The transmission spec- 
trum of a 12 cm long CaF 2 rod from the same manufacturer of 
the 16 cm long rods used in the HPHT was measured at room- 
temperature with a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer. The measured 
spectrum is shown in Fig. 4 from 2.5 to 8.3 μm with transmission 
above 90% over much of the measured range until the transmission 
transitions to 10% between 6 and 8 μm. Theoretical transmission 
through the rod was calculated from the Fresnel equations and 
the wavelength-dependent index of refraction and absorption co- 
efficient of CaF 2 [32] . The theoretical simulation, plotted in Fig. 4 , 
agrees with measurements at all measured wavelengths. 
With increasing temperature, the transmission edge of many 
infrared  optical  materials  becomes  shorter  [26,28] .  CaF 2  is  no 
exception  and  its  infrared  transmission  edge  has  been  studied 
from cryogenic temperatures to the elevated temperatures rele- 
vant here [31,33,34] . Namjoshi et al. and Lipson et al. measured 
the absorption coefficient of CaF 2 and other fluoride crystals at 
temperatures between 295 and 800 K and found the temperature 
dependence of the absorption coefficient in the infrared transmis- 
sion edge to be described by a multiphonon absorption process. 
During elevated temperature operation, the temperature gradient 
across the window rods would limit the useful transmission range 
of  the  HPHT  cell  to  ∼6.5–7  μm.  Additional  transmission  data 
found in studies of the contamination of fluoride crystals after 
heat treatment in oxidative and wet environments suggest great 
care must be taken to limit the exposure to moisture and ox- 
idative environments when performing experiments above 600 ◦C 
[29,30,32] . Furthermore, published thermal dispersion coefficients 
for  CaF 2  indicate  the  index  of  refraction  exhibits  little  change 
with temperature ( d n/d T ∼ −10 −5 C1  ) [35] . Thus, the temperature 
gradient  across  the  window  rods  during  elevated  temperature 
operation of the HPHT is not expected to significantly alter the 
refractive properties observed at room temperature. 
5.2. Path length 
The  path  length  of  the  HPHT  cell  was  calculated  to  be 
21.3 cm based on the precisely measured geometry of the various 
components used in the cell’s construction. Additionally, room- 
temperature absorption measurements of NO at known pressure 
and concentration confirmed the path length to within 2% (See 
Fig. 7 (a)). Since the cell is a metal body, changes in path length 
due to thermal expansion must be considered. At the maximum 
operating condition, the change in path length due to thermal 
expansion  was  estimated  to  be  less  than  1%  of  the  nominal 
length due to most of the expansion of the Inconel metal body 
(CTE = ∼ 14 × 10 −6 1/m) being countered by the expansion of the 
CaF 2 rods (CTE = ∼ 20 × 10 −6 1/m). 
5.3. Temperature uniformity 
To measure the HPHT cell’s temperature distribution along the 
optical path length, a type-K thermocouple with 1 cm graduations 
was translated through the stainless steel thermocouple sheath. 
The temperature measurements of the outer wall is equal to the 
inner gas temperature as shown in the analysis of a similar gas cell 
by Schwarm et al. [36] . The measured temperature distributions 
at different conditions are shown in Fig. 3 . Without supplemen- 
tary heating from the band heaters, the heat load supplied by 
the single-zone furnace provided only a short region of uniform 
temperature ( ∼5 cm). Furthermore, the inherent distribution of 
the furnace was found to be biased to one side. To improve and 
optimize  the  temperature  uniformity,  the  band  heater  settings 
were  iteratively  adjusted  until  the  results  were  satisfactory.  A 
22  cm  region  bounding  the  21.3  cm  optical  path  length  was 
measured  at  1  cm  increments  for  each  of  the  profiles  shown. 
At 802 K, the temperature profile saw a maximum deviation of 
19 K or 2.37% from the mean. However, this maximum deviation 
represents only a small fraction of the total path length. Perhaps 
a more indicative metric of the temperature uncertainty along the 
path length would be a standard deviation which is less than 1% 
for each condition shown. 
5.4. Pressure stability 
Pressure  transducers  (Setra)  rated  to  67  and  1.7  atm  were 
used to measure pressures above and below 1.7 atm, respectively. 
Pressure loss was evaluated at different temperature and pressure 
conditions. However, no significant change in leak rate was ob- 
served at elevated temperatures. Under vacuum conditions, the 
pressure was found to be very stable at all temperatures with a 
pressure change of 1 mTorr/s which is negligible for the duration 
of  a  TDLAS  measurement.  At  pressures  above  1  atm,  the  rate 
of pressure change per minute was on the order of 0.01% of the 
nominal pressure. For instance, the drop in pressure at 30 atm was 
observed to be < 0.02 atm after two minutes at any temperature 
condition. During the measurements discussed in the following 
sections, the resolution of the 67 atm pressure transducer could 
not resolve any pressure changes throughout the duration of the 
external cavity quantum cascade laser measurement that lasted 
roughly 6 seconds. Thus, the pressure stability was found to be 
adequate for high-pressure spectroscopy.  
6. Experimental setup and procedure 
6.1. Gas system 
The HPHT was connected to a high-pressure valve manifold that 
controls the flow of gases to the HPHT facility, room-temperature 
reference  cell,  gas  cylinders,  mixing  tank,  vacuum  pump,  and 
exhaust ventilation. At several strategic locations in the manifold 
matrix, pressure transducers monitor the system pressure. Before 
making a measurement, the desired gas mixture of dilute nitric 
oxide in nitrogen was allowed to slowly flow through both optical 
cells for several minutes to allow saturation of NO wall adsorption. 
Next,  the  room-temperature  reference  cell  was  filled  with  the 
gas mixture to a low pressure ( < 0.1 atm), providing an absolute 
wavelength marker during experiments. After isolating the refer- 
ence cell, the HPHT was slowly filled to the desired pressure with 
the NO mixture. 
6.2. Optical system 
An external cavity quantum cascade laser (ECQCL) (Daylight 
Solutions), with a maximum continuous wave output power of 
50 mW, was used to probe the R-branch of the NO fundamental 
band. The laser’s output frequency range (1880–1943 cm −1 ) spans 
most of the R-branch and can be tuned over that range via the 
rotation of its diffraction grating. However, its mode-hop-free re- 
gion spans only about one third of the total frequency range from 
1924 to 1943 cm −1 . Out of the laser package, the beam displays 
excellent beam quality and good collimation with little divergence 
observed through the many laser paths. Its line width is specified 
to be less than 10 MHz which qualifies as monochromatic light for 
the purposes of this work. 
Fig.  5  shows  the  optical  components  and  laser  beam  paths 
through  the  HPHT  and  reference  cells.  After  exiting  the  laser 
cavity,  the  laser  beam  was  split  with  a  zinc  selenide  (ZnSe) 
window  wedge.  One  of  the  split  beams  was  directed  through 
the HPHT and focused onto a thermoelectrically cooled mercury–
cadmium–telluride (MCT) detector (Vigo Systems) with a parabolic 
mirror. Before reaching the parabolic mirror, the remaining optical 
power ( ∼70% after transmission through ZnSe) was attenuated by 
collecting the reflection off a CaF 2 flat to ensure a maximum laser 
power to thermal emission ratio. The second beam path from the 
ZnSe beam splitter was split a second time to a reference detector 
(IR Associates) and a third beam splitter. The third beam splitter 
directs one beam through a solid germanium Fabry–Perot etalon 
(FSR = 0.0163 cm −1 ) before it is focused onto a thermoelectrically 
cooled MCT detector (Vigo Systems) with a CaF 2 lens. Lastly, the 
final beam is directed through the reference cell after which the 
beam is focused onto a thermoelectrically cooled MCT detector 
(Vigo Systems) with another CaF 2 lens. 
The grating tuning was controlled by the ECQCL controller with 
no external inputs to the controller or laser head. Timing signals 
from the ECQCL controller and signals from the four detectors 
were  recorded  at  100  kHz  by  the  multi-channel  DAQ  system 
(National Instruments PXI-6115 boards in a PXIe-1062Q chassis). 
This  sampling  rate  provided  more  than  adequate  resolution  as 
full scans from 1880 to 1945 cm −1 were complete in roughly 6 s. 
For each measurement, a dark signal, a transmission background 
signal,  and  a  transmission  signal  were  needed  for  proper  data 
processing. The dark signals capture any systematic detector signal 
offsets from the system without the laser passing through. The 
transmission background signals represent the I 0 in Eq. (1) and are 
recorded when no absorbing gas species is present in the HPHT 
cell. Finally, the transmission signals are recorded with an absorb- 
ing gas species present in the HPHT cell. The data processing steps 
will be discussed in the next section. 
7. Measurements and results 
7.1. Data reduction process 
Proper data reduction required the 4 detector signals and 3 
measurement  types  described  in  the  previous  section.  The  EC- 
QCL exhibits slight scan-to-scan intensity variations, and this is 
mitigated through use of a common-mode rejection strategy. In 
common-mode rejection, a ratio between the reference detector 
and gas cell detectors is measured as a function of optical fre- 
quency during the transmission background measurement. Thus, 
any non-absorption intensity variations measured between I 0 and 
I t are removed. The etalon signal was used as a high-resolution 
wavelength calibration to ensure alignment between the I 0 and I t 
measurement sets. To calibrate absolute wavelength, all measure- 
ments sets were collected with a low pressure mixture of dilute 
NO in N 2 in the reference cell. Fig. 6 displays transmission spectra 
after implementing common mode rejection and an example of 
the wavelength calibration procedure. 
After implementing common-mode rejection and properly cali- 
brating wavelengths, the absorbance baseline was measured from 
two background transmission measurement sets. Many optical ma- 
terials under mechanical stress exhibit birefringence. Although the 
extent of the stress-induced birefringence in the long CaF 2 rods 
was expected to be low, this effect was investigated at several 
pressures. The top panel of Fig. 6 shows the measured absorbance 
baseline when the HPHT cell was filled with 20 atm of oxygen. 
The oxygen ensured any remaining NO in the gas system was ox- 
idized, resulting in a true absorbance baseline measurement. No 
significant changes in transmitted light intensity were observed, 
and the measured baseline noise was found to be  ≈ ±0.01. Ob- 
served temperature effects were negligible since all measurements 
are recorded with the same heating load applied to the CaF 2 rods. 
7.2. Room-temperature validation 
Operation of the cell and performance of the ECQCL were first 
evaluated in room-temperature (294 K here) experiments at sev- 
eral  pressures  and  compared  to  simulations  using  the  HITRAN 
database. Following the experimental procedure outlined in the 
previous section, a mixture of 2.03% (Praxair certified grade with 
X NO uncertainty of ±2%) NO in nitrogen was added to the HPHT 
and reference cells. Fig. 7 (a) displays the validation measurement 
at 1 atm superimposed by a HITRAN simulation at the same con- 
ditions. Transition peak absorbances from the HITRAN simulation 
are about 4% higher than the measured absorbance because the 
collision-broadening coefficients ( γ) reported by HITRAN are ad- 
justed for air whereas the current measurements are in nitrogen 
[37] . Measurements of the oxygen broadening coefficient [38] in- 
dicate that γNO –O 2  is about 20% smaller than γNO –N 2  leading to 
γNO –air reported by HITRAN to be about 4% less than γNO –N 2 . With 
this adjustment made, the measured and simulated spectra agree 
more favorably with peak absorbances differing by less than 0.5%. 
Room-temperature  measurements  at  higher  pressures  up  to 
34 atm are shown in  Fig. 7 (b).  To  remain below the  optically 
thick limit, a mixture of 3500 ppm NO in nitrogen was made 
for these measurements. Since the uncertainty in this mixture is 
much higher than that of the 2.03% NO mixture, Voigt line shapes 
were fit to a 1 atm measurement to more accurately determine the 
concentration of NO. The resulting best-fit concentration was then 
used in high-pressure simulations for a better comparison with the 
measurements. 
Observed deviations from the HITRAN simulations grow with 
pressure. Super-Lorentzian absorbance is observed at the lower 
frequencies until a crossover to sub-Lorentzian absorbance occurs 
near 1936 cm −1 . These observations are consistent with trends 
found in line mixing studies [20,39,40] and in particular with ex- 
periments and calculations by Abels and DeBall [41] and Hirono 
and Ichikawa [19,42] , who reported a band-correction function for 
the absorption coefficient in the troughs between adjacent transi- 
tions at 296 K and below 1 atm in NO–N 2 mixtures. The band- 
correction function, K ( ν), is defined in Eq. (7) as the ratio of the 
observed absorption coefficient with line mixing and the absorp- 
tion coefficient due to Lorentz-type broadening. 
Measured and calculated band correction functions in [19,42] re- 
ported peak values of about 1.1 near the R-branch center which 
are  consistent  with  the  deviations  observed  here  between  1.1 
and 1.2 in the troughs between absorption peaks. Additionally, 
the reported super-to-sub Lorentzian transition frequency is near 
1936 cm −1 as observed in this work. 
7.3. High-temperature, high-pressure NO spectra 
Using the methods outlined above, the spectrum of NO in N 2 
was measured at 618 and 802 K at pressures up to 33 atm. These 
measurements  are  shown  in  Fig.  8 .  For  comparable  pressures, 
deviations  from  the  Voigt  model  using  the  HITEMP  database 
are less pronounced in high-temperature measurements than in 
room-temperature measurements. Studies have demonstrated that 
line-mixing and the breakdown of the impact approximation are 
primarily effects of gas density rather than simply gas pressure 
[17,40] .  Observed  deviations  trend  similarly  at  comparable  gas 
densities  with  the  room-temperature  measurements,  yet  the 
transition  from  super-to-sub  Lorentzian  is  no  longer  observed 
near  1936  cm −1  as  in  the  room-temperature  case.  To  the  au- 
thors’ knowledge band-correction functions for NO as a function 
of  temperature,  pressure,  and  collision  partner  have  not  been 
reported. Line mixing studies of other small molecules reporting 
band-correction  functions  at  several  temperatures  indicate  that 
as  temperature  increases  the  super-to-sub  Lorentzian  transition 
frequency  shifts,  like  the  rovibrational  intensity  distribution, 
to  frequencies  near  higher  J ′′  transitions  [39,40] .  Therefore,  a 
super-to-sub  Lorentzian  transition  is  expected  to  exist  outside 
the  tuning  range  of  the  ECQCL  used  in  this  study.  Additional 
observed deviations between the measured and simulated spec-  
tra reveal that improvements to the HITEMP database collision 
broadening  parameters,  particularly  for  high  J ′′  transitions  can 
be  made.  Furthermore,  the  inconsistencies  between  simulated 
and measured line shape broadening makes determination of the 
super-to-sub  Lorentzian  transition  frequency  difficult.  The  need 
to improve existing databases to properly account for collisional 
effects  at  high-temperatures  is  evident  from  the  high-pressure, 
high-temperature spectra presented here. 
8. Summary and conclusions 
The design, build, and operation of an optical cell for high- 
temperature,  high-pressure  mid-IR  spectroscopy  was  presented. 
For  optical  access  from  ∼ 0.15  to  8  μm,  the  optical  cell  uses 
16 cm CaF 2 rods to penetrate the temperature gradient imposed 
by  the  single-zone  furnace  used  as  the  primary  heating  load. 
Penetration by the CaF 2 rods allows the optical cell’s gas-tight seal 
to be maintained at much lower temperature during operation at 
high-temperature set points. Temperature uniformity across the 
optical path length of 21.3 cm is maintained by the temperature- 
controlled  single-zone  furnace  and  temperature-controlled  band 
heaters attached to the body of the optical cell. Good temperature 
uniformity up to 800 K and pressure stability above 30 atm were 
demonstrated. 
Spectra of the R-branch in the fundamental rovibrational band 
of nitric oxide at several temperatures and pressures up to 800 K 
and 34 atm, respectively, were measured by an ECQCL for the op- 
tical cell’s characterization and demonstration of utility. Deviations 
between the measurements and a Voigt-based model using the 
HITRAN/HITEMP databases were observed with increasing gas den- 
sity. These deviations are attributed primarily to line-mixing, but 
at elevated temperatures, inconsistencies between the observed 
pressure broadening and that of the HITEMP/HITRAN databases 
is evident. These findings emphasize the need for high-pressure 
and  high-temperature  spectroscopy  experiments  to  characterize 
high gas density phenomena, and this facility provides a practical 
means to study the spectra of molecules into the mid-IR. 
High-temperature gas-phase kinetics of the thermal decomposition of tetramethoxysilane
ABSTRACT
The decomposition of tetramethoxysilane (Si(OCH3)4, TMOS) was studied in shock-tube experiments in the 1131每1610 K temperature range at pressures ranging from 1.9 to 2.3 bar behind reflected shock waves combining gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and high-repetition-rate time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HRR-TOF-MS). The initial reaction is a four-center elimination to form methanol. At elevated temperatures, TMOS also decomposes via a O每C bond scission forming a methyl (CH3) and the corresponding OSi(OCH3)3 radical. The main observed products were methane (CH4), methanol (CH3OH), ethylene (C2H4), and ethane (C2H6). The yields of these products increase with temperature. mechanism contains 13 silicon species and 24 reactions with silicon-containing species. It was combined with the methanol mechanism of Burke et al. The measured global rate constant for TMOS decomposition was found to be koverall[TMOS products].
INTRODUCTION
Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is widely used as a coating material and additive because of its chemical stability, hardness, transparency in the visible spectrum, and high resistivity. It is the basis for production of ultra-pure optical glass and a major application in the semiconductor industry is the use as an electrically insulating layer. Tetram-ethoxysilane (TMOS) is the simplest homolog in the group of the alkoxylsilanes Si(OR)4 and is used as a precursor for SiO2 coatings deposited through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and is used for flame-based nanoparticle synthesis. For process development, the kinetics of chemical composition and primary reactions must be understood. There is a variety of potential precursors for high-temperature synthesis of SiO2, such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO), and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4). Therefore, the dependence of the reactivity on the molecular structure is of interest when selecting precursors and process conditions for specific applications. This paper aims at providing experimental kinetics data and developing and validating a kinetics mechanism for the decomposition of TMOS and the following products formation in a wide range of temperatures.
Chu et al. studied the decomposition kinetics of TMOS by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) in a static cell at temperatures between 858 and 968 K and a pressure of 930 mbar. They obtained the following overall first-order rate coefficient for the consumption of TMOS
reported that TMOS was consumed to a significant extent by bimolecular reactions and indicated that H atoms have the largest impact on the TMOS consumption. They developed a mechanism based on quantum-chemical calculations and assumed two rate-controlling reactions: TMOS CH3OH (CH3O)2SiOCH2 and CH2OSi(OCH3)3 CH2O Si(OCH3)3. Their model accounts semi-quantitatively for the formation of the secondary products. Similar experiments have recently also addressed oxygenfree silicon precursors such as tetramethylsilane (Si(CH3)4, TMS).
In the present work, experiments were carried out in a single-pulse shock tube coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) that enables concentration measurements of stable products in a conventional shock tube. The shock tube is also coupled to high-repetition-rate time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HRR-TOF-MS) for time-resolved concentration measurements of multiple species including intermediates from gases continuously sampled from the shock tube. This time-resolved information provides an important additional constraint for the development of reaction mechanisms. The sensitive GC/MS technique enables experiments with low reactant concentrations (250每1200 ppm) and permits the use of chemical inhibitors in large excess to suppress bi molecular reactions. In contrast, the measurements with HRR-TOF-MS require reactant concentrations in the 0.25每0.5% range. 
METHOD
The experiments were performed in a stainlesssteel shock-tube with an inner diameter of 80 mm and a total length of 8.8 m. The shock tube consists of a driver section with a length of 2.5 m and the driven section of 6.3 m, both sections are separated from each other by an aluminum diaphragm with thicknesses of 30每70 米m depending on the target temperature. To operate the shock tube in singlepulse mode, the driven section is equipped with a 0.35 m3 dump tank, which can be separated from the shock tube by a ball valve (60 mm inner diameter). In single-pulse mode, the dump tank is filled with nitrogen (N2) at the same filling pressures (50每150 mbar) as the driven section and the valve is opened just before an experiment is performed. The driver and driven sections were connected to a four-stage rotary pump (Edwards dry star, Model QDP 80) combined with a mechanical booster pump (Edwards, EH 500A) to achieve a final pressure of 3 10?3 mbar. The initial pressure p1 of the test gas in the driven section was measured using a capacitance manometer (Edwards, Trans 600 AB). The velocity of the shock wave was determined using a set of four pressure transducers (Kistler, 603B) placed at the end of the driven section in equidistant intervals of 150 mm and the velocity was extrapolated to the end plate of the driven section with an observed attenuation of less than 1%. The conditions of the gas behind the reflected shock wave (temperature T5 and pressure p5) were calculated from the shock-wave velocities using the standard ideal gas shock-wave relations with uncertainties in the calculated temperature around 15 K. A fifth pressure transducer (PCB, 112A05) was positioned 20 mm away from the end plate. For further details of the experimental facility, see Ref.
All mixtures were prepared in a 50l stainlesssteel vessel and stirred for at least four hours. A turbomolecular pump (Pfeiffer, TMH 071 P) evacuated the vessel down to a pressure of 7 10?7 mbar. Depending on the detection technique, Ar or Ne was used as bath gas (s. Table 1). In one set of experiments, toluene was used as a chemical inhibitor, which suppresses secondary reactions of reactive hydrogen atoms and methyl radicals formed during TMOS pyrolysis. In this case, toluene (C6H5每CH3) scavenges the formed radicals and permits to study the decomposition of TMOS without interference of secondary reactions.
For the identification and quantification, the shock tube is operated in single-pulse mode. The shock tube is coupled to a heated (363 K) gas sampling system that automatically transfers gas samples to a GC/MS (Agilent 7890A and MSD 5975C) after each experiment. The gas chromatograph (GC) was equipped with a PLOT-Q column for the separation of nonpolar and polar compounds up to C12 and a HP5 column for the separation of larger species. Both columns are connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). Kr was used as internal standard. Further details are given in Ref.
To simultaneously measure multiple species with a time resolution of 10 米s, the shock tube is operated in conventional mode and coupled to a high-repetition-rate time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HRR-TOF-MS, Kaesdorf). Details are reported in Ref. [11,15], therefore only a brief description is given here. The HRR-TOF-MS is connected by an ISO flange to the end plate of driven section of the shock tube. The end plate contains a nozzle with a diameter of 60 米m protruding 1 mm into the shock tube. An electron-impact ion source with an energy of 45 eV was used for the ionization and the acceleration of the ionizing electrons. The TOF-MS is operated in reflection mode and the ions are detected with a two stage micro-channel plate detector (MCP). The repetition rate was set to 100 kHz, which provides full mass spectra with masses up to 175 u in intervals of 10 米s. The data was recorded by a 8 bit A/D card (Agilent acqiris, DP214) with a sampling rate of 2 GS/s. In all HRRTOF-MS measurements, Ne was used as bath gas because of its low electron-impact ionization cross section and the integrated mass filter was used to further suppress the Ne signal to prevent detector overload. To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the MCP voltage was adjusted to maximize the reactant peak intensity within the linear range of the instrument while partially saturating the Ne peak. The raw data were converted into intensity每 time profiles by summation of the peak area over a certain time profile by a Matlab routine. 
The reaction mechanism was adopted from Chu et al. and updated in this work. It includes possible initial dissociation processes of TMOS and molecular elimination reactions as well as bond fissions. The mechanism is divided into two sub-mechanisms: The silicon/silicon-oxide sub-mechanism was taken from Chu et al. and was complemented with the results of this study; and the sub-mechanism describing the CH3OH chemistry was taken from Burke et al. Thermodynamic data of most Si-containing species were calculated by Ho and Meliu. However, for five species, n thermodynamic data were available (CH2OSi (OCH3)2, C2H5OSiO (OCH3), HSi(OCH3)3, CH2OSi (OCH3)3,and CH2OSi (OCH3)2) and thus obtained here from quantum chemical calculations at the G4 level of theory using the GAUSSIAN 09 package. The respective data is shown in the supplemental material.
Based on molecular structures, frequencies and moments of inertia obtained from the quantum chemical calculations, thermodynamic data Cp(T), Hf (T) and S(T) were derived by using the GPOP program. Cp, H, and S are also functions of the temperature and TMOS is considered as a perfect gas. At 1每2 bar and diluted conditions real gas effects are not expected. The vibrational frequencies calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory during the G4 procedure were scaled by 0.99 for the zero-point energy calculation and by 0.97 for the vibrational partition-function calculations. B3LYP functionals are known to underestimate imaginary frequencies in transition-state theory calculations, but apart from this problem, they usually yield very reasonable frequency values and we expect that this also applies for silicon-organic compounds. To support this assumption, we compared simulated IR spectra of TMOS and experimental frequencies (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The measured data were obtained by IR absorption measurements of thin amorphous films of condensed TMOS reported by Ignatyev et al. At wavenumbers below 1000 cm每1, the B3LYP calculation is able to reproduce experimental frequencies within deviations of less than 20 cm每1. Between 1000 and 1600 cm每1, the calculated frequencies deviate from the measured values by not more than 40 cm每1. Therefore, we assume that even for larger silicon-organic compounds like TMOS, the groups attached to oxygen atoms were treated as hindered rotations using the Pitzer-Gwinn approximation as implemented in GPOP. Rotational barrier heights for CH3 rotors were obtained from relaxed potential energy surface (PES) scans at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory with dihedral angles used as coordinates for the scans. CH3 groups represent symmetric rotors, an asymmetric rotor. Since the Pitzer-Gwinn approximation for the hindered rotor partition function, qPG, depends on the rotational barrier height, V0, the partition function of the C2H5 rotor needs to be evaluated to derive suitable values for V0. For this purpose, the potential of the C2H5 rotor was fitted to a regression function. Here, 汐 represents the dihedral angle, a1每a12 are the fitting parameters, and c1每c6 are constants (Figure S1 (a)). With the program BEx1D, which is a Schr?dinger-equation eigen-problem solver for an intramolecular onedimensional hindered rotation, the exact values, qHR, for the hindered rotor partition function can be obtained based on the fitting function V(汐). The Pitzer-Gwinn approximation qPG is evaluated for the lowest vibrational mode corresponding to an internal rotation. The value of V0 is adjusted until qPG is within less than	5% of qHR (Figure S2 (b)). To limit the computational effort, the PG approximation is preferred over the exact partition function, which is only needed in special cases when strongly asymmetric rotor potentials are involved.
C2H5OSiO(OCH3) can also decompose by eliminations. There are two possible elimination channels: C2H5OSiO(OCH3) CH4 CH3CHO SiO2 R14) which represents a six-center elimination, and C2H5OSiO(OCH3) C2H4 OHSiO(OCH3) R15), which is a four-center elimination. Only by adjusting the rate constants k14 and k15 it was possible to correctly reproduce CH4 and C2H4 concentration profiles. Future quantum-chemical calculations should validate the possibility of CH4 elimination and the choice of rate constants for k14 and k15. Furthermore, the simulation of the experimental data of Chu et al. with our mechanism considering the initial TMOS decomposition steps in the fall-off range is in good agreement for CH4, CO, and TMOS except for CH2O at 915 and 953 K.
RESULT and DISCUSSION
In this study, we measured the rate constants k[TMOS products] of the decomposition of TMOS behind reflected shock waves in a singlepulse shock tube with GC/MS, and with HRRTOF-MS. The experiments were carried out at 1131每1610 K and 1.9每2.3 bar and concentrations between 330 and 5000 ppm TMOS in Ar or Ne (Table 1).
The pyrolysis of TMOS is endothermic and the heat consumption rises with increasing temperature. All measurements were modeled with Chemical Workbench based on non-reactive pressure profiles of pure Ar or Ne which account temperature variations during the reaction and cooling phases gure 1 shows the consumption of TMOS and the product distribution during the thermal decomposition of TMOS for varying temperatures and initial concentrations. The decomposition of TMOS starts noticeably around 1200 K and at 1400 K TMOS is completely consumed. The main products during the decomposition were CH3OH, CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. Acetylene (C2H2) was found in much smaller concentrations while no silicon-containing products were detected. The primary stable product CH3OH is formed via Si(OCH3)4 H3OH CH2OSi(OCH3)2 (R2). ocal sensitivity analysis for CH3OH demonstrates that R2 has the largest impact on the measured CH3OH concentration and at T > 1400 K, reaction CH3OH + H CH2OH + H2 strongly influences the CH3OH concentration (Fig. 2). This is the main reaction consuming CH3OH that was missing in the mechanism of Chu et al. 
Besides the elimination of CH3OH, TMOS can also decompose by the dissociation R1. This is only a minor channel and at 1000 K the branching ratio BRR1 k1/(k1 k2) of Chu et al. suggests that only 1.3% decomposes by R1. The impact of R1 rises with increasing temperature and for instance at 1525 K 30% of TMOS were decomposed by reaction R1 postulated by Chu et al.(Fig. 3).
Figure 1 shows that the formation of CH4, C2H4, and C2H6 starts at 1300 K. The CH4 concentration reaches its maximum at 1400 K. In comparison to CH4, C2H4, and C2H6 are formed in much smaller concentrations. CH3 is formed mainly by the bond fission R1 and slightly contributes to CH4 formation by bimolecular reactions with TMOS and TMOS decomposition products. Chu et al. identified carbon monoxide (CO) by FTIR as another reaction product during the decomposition. We also found CO, but due to its low sensitivity with the GC/MS it was not possible to quantify the CO concentration. The use of C6H5每CH3 as chemical inhibitor shifts the decomposition to significantly higher temperatures because C6H5每CH3 suppresses bimolecular reactions between TMOS and radicals. In addition, C6H5每CH3 inhibits the molecular elimination reaction to CH3OH probably because C6H5每CH3 reacts with the dipolar intermediate OC?H2每(OCH3)Si每O+H每CH3 postulated by Chu
et al. to TMOS and benzyl so that the molecular rearrangement of the intermediate to methanol and CH2OSi(OCH3)2 does not occur. In the presence of C6H5每CH3, almost no CH3OH was formed and only CH4 was measured. The formation of CH4 indicates that TMOS decomposes mainly by an O每C bond scission and is in accordance with the calculated energy barriers of C每O and Si-O bonds with 410 kJ/mol and 548 kJ/mol, respectively [9]. Figure 1 also shows the simulation of the measured TMOS and its products with the proposed mechanism (Table 2). The decomposition of TMOS for initial concentrations of 300每1200 ppm as well as the formation of products simulated based on the mechanism of this work agree with the experimental data. The carbon yield represents the amount of C atoms of formed products divided by the amount of C atoms of the decomposed TMOS and was calculated for different initial concentrations of TMOS (Figure S4). At the lowest extents of reaction, only 25% of the consumed carbon was measured. With increased temperature, more products are formed and the carbon yield increases up to 50%. We attribute this carbon-yield deficit to carbon bonded to undetectable intermediate silicon species after the initial decomposition step. Another factor that lowers the carbon yield, is the missing CO and CH2O in the carbon balance.
Figure 4 compares HRR-TOF-MS mass spectra for pre-shock conditions (T1 295 K, p1 42.5 mbar, averaged for 0.5 ms) and for post-reflected-shock conditions (T5 1516 K, p5 1.41 bar, averaged fo 1.5 ms). TMOS shows a base peak at m/z 121 and the parent peak at m/z 152 and many smaller fragment peaks spread over the complete spectrum For thee valuation of the concentration每time profiles of TMOS we used the base peak at m/z 121 that corresponds to Si(OCH3)3+. The peaks at m/z 40 and 80每86 are related to the internal standards Ar and Kr, respectively. The peak at m/z 28 is the base peak of CO and overlaps with a smaller fragment peak of TMOS and the base peak of C2H4, nevertheless it is possible to separate the signals of TMOS, C2H4 and CO at m/z 28, though every separation step deteriorate the SNR. For the evaluation of C2H4, the fragment signal at m/z 27 (C2H3+) was used. It is speculative but it is possible that the peak at m/z 30 is the parent peak of CH2O, the base peak at m/z 29 overlaps with a fragment peak of TMOS. The GC/MS measurements show that CH3OH is formed during the decomposition of TMOS, therefore the signal at m/z 32 is attributed to the parent peak of CH3OH and the base peak of CH3OH at m/z = 31 overlaps with fragment peak of TMOS. It was not possible to quantify CH3OH and CH2O concentrations because their signal intensities were too weak. However, the appearance of the peaks at m/z 30 and 32 shows qualitatively the formation of these products and reflects the decomposition of TMOS. With the HRR-TOF-MS, no silicon-containing product species were detected.
Figure 5 shows measured and calculated concentration每time profiles for TMOS, and CO for T5 1533 K, p5 1.35 bar for 0.5% TMOS in Ne. The simulation accurately predicts [TMOS]t and underpredicts [CO]t by 30%. The scatter of the CO data is caused by the evaluation using separation of three overlapping peaks at m/z 28. It was not possible to evaluate the base peak of C2H4 at m/z 28 because this peak overlaps with the base peak of CO and a fragment peak of TMOS. The SNR of the smaller fragment peak at m/z 27 was too low to quantify the C2H4 concentration.
Figure 6 contains the data of the simulated values for the TMOS decomposition using the mechanism discussed in Table 2 based on the TMOS consumption measured with GC/MS and HRR-TOF-MS. The Arrhenius expression koverall[TMOS products] 2.9 1011exp( 225 kJ mol?1/RT)s?1 was obtained by ascertaining the disappearance of TMOS to the sum of the dissociation channels (R1, R2). For the k1/k2 ratio, we used the temperature-dependent branching ratio BRR2 k2/(k1 k2) given by Chu et al. [9]. Figure 6 shows that the GC/MS data for temperatures between 1131 and 1438 K ties seamlessly to the HRR-TOFMS data for 1440每1610 K and the results of both techniques are consistent (Fig. 6), the uncertainty of the final rate expression is about 30%. The extrapolated rate coefficient of Chu et al. agrees well with our measurements at lower temperatures. At the higher temperatures of our study, the rate coefficients and the observed activation energy are lower due to fall-off effects at these conditions. The rate constant of the measurements with C5H6每CH3 compared to the measurements without inhibitor is roughly a factor of four slower and coincides with the rate constant of the dissociation of CH3 (R1). The result confirms the exclusive formation of CH4 when the chemical inhibitor was used.
CONCLUSION
The pyrolysis of TMOS was studied behind reflected shock waves at 1131每1610 K and 1.9 to 2.3 bar. The results indicate that TMOS decom- poses mainly via four-center isomerization with subsequent three-center cyclization and elimination forming CH3OH and (CH3O)SiOCH2. At higher temperatures, the C每O bond fission to CH3OSi(OCH3)3 gains importance. The main detected products are CH3OH, CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. Measurements with C6H5每CH3 as radical inhibitor reveal that the TMOS decomposition is influenced by secondary reactions. When C6H5每 CH3 was used, mainly CH4 and no CH3OH was formed. It is assumed that C6H5每CH3 interacts with a dipolar intermediate during the elimination of CH3OH and inhibits the formation towards CH3OH. A kinetics mechanism based on the mechanism of Chu et al. and the methanol mechanism from Burke et al. was developed. The silicon species sub-mechanism consists of 24 reactions containing 13 silicon species. The mechanism was updated with the rate coefficients of this study and additional reactions were included to account for the product concentrations. A good agreement was achieved with all detected species. This study substantially expanded the temperature range of previous TMOS pyrolysis studies and the mechanism can be applied for modelling high-temperature processes in gas-phase systems using TMOS as a precursor for the synthesis of SiO2.
Large eddy simulations of the Darmstadt turbulent stratified flame series
Abstract
Large-eddy simulations of the Darmstadt turbulent stratified flame (TSF) burner are presented. The TSF burner is operated under a wide variety of conditions. A case without stratification or shear, and one with stratification but no shear, are considered for validation purposes. A combined mixture fraction and reaction progress variable approach is used, with the reaction rate modelled by a fractal flame wrin￾kling flame surface density model, where the laminar flame speed is obtained as a function of the mixture fraction. The simulation results and the suitability of the modelling approach are verified and validated through comparison of mean and variance of axial and radial velocity, temperature and mixture fraction with experimental data. The effects of stratification on the flame flow field are then studied by comparing the two reactive simulations, and studying the impact of the cross-scalar dissipation rate term. Finally, the occurrence of potential back- or front-supported stratification is examined through statistical analysis of the flame normal directions. The modelling approach employed was found to produce very good predic￾tions of the TSF burner, with both back- and front-supported stratification modes occurring, the former being considerably more likely.
1. Introduction
Large eddy simulation (LES) relies on resolving the largest structures while modelling the effect of those that have a size below a specified filter width D. The technique yields advantages over classical Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) [1,2] and is particularly useful in the prediction of unsteady reactive flows. From a practical stand￾point, many combustion processes rely on reactive mixtures that are non-homogenous, an example is the direct injection IC engine, where liquid fuel is injected into the combustion chamber to generate a highly stratified fuel/air mixture at ignition in order to achieve improved energy conversion [3]. Several numerical and experimental studies have shown that stratification has a significant impact on the heat release rate, flame propagation speed, flame structure and stabilisation mechanism. In two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (2D￾DNS) studies conducted by Jime´nez et al. [4], a fuel-lean propane mixture with an asymmetric equivalence ratio / distribution yielded substan-tially higher heat release rate per unit flame length than for a homogenous mixture. Experiments [5] and numerical simulations [6] of laminar flames showed increases in flame propagation speed for back-supported stratified flames due to the ele￾vated heat flux and radical concentrations in the richer products. Stratification also has the effect of altering the flame structure, such as increasing the flame surface density above that of a turbulent premixed flame at the same mean equivalence ratio 7,8]. Fluctuations in the equivalence ratio for stratified flames can also induce additional stretch￾ing of the flame causing a reduced flame thickness [9]. Finally, in laboratory-scale flames, stratifica￾tion can change the flame shape as the stabilisation point of the flame can alter. For example, the lean premixed stratified burner by Kim and Hochgreb [10] displayed an M-shaped geometry for a fully premixed flame which can develop into either a dihedral V-flame or a toroidal detached flame depending on the relative fuel richness in the outer and inner streams. A similar observation is reported by Nogenmyr et al. [11], whose study showed an alternating appearance of V- and W￾shaped flames. To date, there are only a limited number of stratified laboratory scale flames [8–10,12,13] that enable LES numerical validation, and the question remains as to whether the existing numerical mod￾els can describe the changes in flame behaviour. As flame speeds are dependent on the local equiva￾lence ratio, flame wrinkling may increase to an extent that specific combustion models may be required. Coupling between the mixture fraction and laminar flame speed also presents a numerical challenge. In the LES of premixed combustion, several modelling concepts have been established to describe the unclosed reaction rate; for example, the artificially thickened flame (ATF) [14,15] approach, the flame front tracking technique (G￾equation) [16–18] and the flame surface density (FSD) method [19–21]. The present work focuses on the latter, which involves closing the reaction rate term within the progress variable c transport equation by means of an algebraic model [20]. Since the flame propagates through an inhomoge￾neous mixture, an additional transport equation for the mixture fraction z will need to be considered and coupled with the c transport equation. The Darmstadt methane/air stratified burner studied by Seffrin et al. [13,22], is an open annu￾lar-burner  esigned in a way that allows the gen￾eration of both shear and stratification in the flow. Consequently the burner can be operated under several different test configurations [13], of which three are simulated in the absence of shear. These are the partially premixed case G, the stratified case A and their non-reactive equiva￾lent A i2 case, summarised in Table 1. The simu￾lations are compared to a range of experimental data such as velocity, temperature and mixture fraction at various locations downstream of the burner exit. Apart from assessing the performance of the LES modelling, we intend to study in detail the physics of the reactive flow for both premixed and stratified operating conditions. The stratifica￾tion may have a significant impact on the flow field as described in the earlier references. This study relies on the relatively simple closure by Fureby [20], and Duwig and Fureby [12], and aims to establish the applicability and limitations of the closure with respect to the prediction of the Darmstadt stratified flame.
2. Numerical modelling
The Favre-filtered governing equations for incompressible fluid flow of temperature depen￾dent density are solved. The turbulent viscosity mt is described using the Smagorinsky model [23] with a fixed constant Cs = 0.173 [24]. For the reactive case, two additional LES-fil￾tered transport equations of z and c must be solved to describe stratified combustion. The mix￾ture fraction z is defined according to Bilger [25] and takes values of 0 and 1 in air and fuel streams, respectively. The filtered mixture fraction trans￾port equation [26] reads:where q, u and l denote the fluid density, flow velocity vector and dynamic viscosity, respec￾tively. The sub-grid convection term in the equa￾tion has been replaced by the simple gradient diffusion expression [26], and the laminar and tur￾bulent Schmidt numbers (Sc and Sct, respectively) are both set to 0.7. The progress variable c can be defined in terms of fuel mass fraction Y F ：where superscripts
u and b denote unburnt and burnt states, respectively. Applying the definition of c to the transport equation of YF and using the relation , where the superscript 0 denotes the mass fraction of fuel in the fuel stream [26], the c transport equation is derived [12,27]: where D is the molecular diffusivity. Equation (2) is valid for both premixed and diffusion combus￾tion [27]. The third term on the RHS of Eq. (2) accounts for the transport of reactants across iso-contours of z, while the last term can be neglected, since for lean flames it can be assumed that all the fuel is burnt Y b. Simplifying and applying LES-filtering, Eq. (2) can be simplified according to Duwig and Fureby [12]: Similar to the ~ z transport equation, the sub-grid convection term can be modelled using the simple gradient assumption. The third term on the RHS of Eq. (3) (henceforth referred to as T3) compen￾sates for the computed flame propagation speed and direction variations resulting from the non￾uniformity of the reactants’ composition [12,28]. For instance, if a flame is propagating towards a leaner mixture (as is typically the case), the flame will accelerate, and vice versa. This term can be seen as a cross-scalar dissipation rate, which is modelled using an effective diffusivity. The molecular diffusion and reaction rate (after LES filtering) can be expressed together in terms of generalised flame surface density Rgen [12,19]:Rgen, where Sd Þs is the density weighted surface-averaged displacement speed. Assuming that curvature effects are weak, [29] with Su denoting the unstretched laminar flame speed. In this case, Su is a local field dependent on the local mixture fraction or equiva￾lence ratio. Substantial data for laminar burning velocities of methane/air flames at varying compo￾sitions are present in the literature [6,30,31] (Fig. 1). In this work, the data by Pires Da Cruz et al. [6] was chosen for Su and interpolated using a third-order polynomial. It is worth noting that the quasi-linearity between Su and / within the range 0.6 < / < 0.9 in Fig. 1 suggests that no expli￾cit modelling of the z sub-grid distribution is required to accurately compute the filtered laminar flame speed. The remaining variable Rgen is related to the wrinkling factor N by: Rgen， which N is formulated using the fractal flame wrinkling (FFW) model proposed by Fureby [20]. The model was found to perform very well in a-pri￾ori [29] as well as in a-posteriori studies [12,32], and is given by: D and Df denote the efficiency function, the subgrid-scale velocity fluctuation and fractal dimension, respectively. Note that unity is added in the model so that N = 1 in laminar regions of the flow field (in the original formulation, the transport equation of kinetic energy k was solvedwith the condition that k > 0 throughout the flow field, so the addition of unity was not necessary). In the present work, it is observed that the magni￾tude of the wrinkling factor lies predominantly be￾tween values of 2 and 3, reaching values of up to 5 in the most wrinkled regions, where stratification occurs. The efficiency function in Eq. (4) serves to account for the net straining effect of eddies smaller than D on the flame and is modelled fol￾lowing Angelberger et al. [14] as: where dL denotes the Zel’dovich flame thickness, defined as D/Su. This flame thickness in the present work is estimated to range from 0.07 to 0.22 mm, depending on the mixture composition, leading to D/dL values of 4.5–14.3 and 2.2–7.1 for the coarse and fine grids, respectively. The subgrid scale velocity fluctuations u0 D in Eq. (5) can be determined by Deardorff [33]:where Cv = 0.1 [34] and the turbulent viscosity mtis estimated from the Smagorinsky model [23]. Fi￾nally, Df is computed through the empirical para￾Fig. 1. Plot of laminar fmetric relation: Df ¼ 2:05= u0 as proposed by North and Santavicca [35]. It is important to note that the issue of flame brush thickness control has been discussed [36–38] for FSD models, in particular far downstream of the burner nozzle. Indeed, the agreement of experiment and simulation may be considered as evidence that the issue is not critical for the Darmstadt stratified flames.
3. Experimental setup and numerical implementa￾tion
For the present investigation, the TSF burner studied by Seffrin et al. [13] is considered, and sketched in Fig. 2. The burner consists of three concentric tubes surrounded by an air co-flow. The inner diameters of the tubes are 14.8 mm, 37 mm and 60 mm, respectively, and the tube length is 500 mm. The central tube acts as the pilot and the flame is stabilized by a flame holder ring situated 40 mm upstream from the pilot tube exit. The design of this burner allows various test configurations to be studied, since the flow rate and equivalence ratios can be adjusted indepen￾dently of the pilot and of each other. The effects of shear and stratification on the flow can there￾fore be examined in greater detail, and the burner presents opportunities for a wide range of interest￾ing computational studies which can be readily compared to experimental data. The velocities of the flow field were measured using laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) at locations 1, 50 and 100 mm downstream of the pilot tube exit for the non-reactive case, while data from more locations are provided for the reactive case. Temperature and other scalar data were obtained from planar Rayleigh scatter￾ing and Raman/Rayleigh line imaging. The simulation is performed with the in-house 3D low-Mach solver, PsiPhi [39,40]. The governing equations of mass, momentum, mixture fraction and reaction progress variable are discretised using the finite volume approach on a Cartesian uniform grid of cubic cells where the cell size represents the filter width. The computational domain is shown in Fig. 2, having a total length of 220 mm, and a width of 240 mm in both y- and z- directions (cropped in the figure). Two grid resolutions of 1 and 0.5 mm are used to study grid-independence, the fine grid corresponding to a 2  2  2 refinement of the coarse grid, leading to domain sizes of more than 12.7 million and 101.4 million cells. To ensure numerical accuracy, the advection term for momentum is discretised using a second-order cen￾tral differencing scheme, and a low storage third order Runge–Kutta scheme is used to advance in time. Neumann conditions are applied at the out- flow boundaries of the computational domain and pseudo-turbulent inflow conditions are created [41,42]. The inflow profiles are generated by impos￾ing non-reactive experimental data obtained at the burner outlet (1 mm downstream) for mean and fluctuating axial and radial velocities. The reactive simulations use the same inflow data, with the pilot velocity adjusted to match the experimental profile of an intermediate case A i1, in which only the pilot is burning. Imposing such inflow profiles at the burner exit avoids the necessity of simulating the whole rig, making detailed studies of different flame configurations more affordable. The burner oper￾ating conditions for both the isothermal and reac￾tive cases are summarised in Table 1. The non￾reactive simulation was performed as a validation study to demonstrate the ability of the chosen approach to accurately simulate the flow. A physi￾cal time of 0.4 s was simulated for all three cases, which represents approximately 13 flow-through times of the bulk flow. The time-step width was determined by a CFL limit of 0.7 for both the iso￾thermal and the reactive case, leading to a total computational time of roughly 35,000 CPUh for the reactive fine grid simulation on 48 processors.
The CFL number was chosen based on experience, as a conservative value that ensures stability and good accuracy; the need to resolve the chemical time scale is avoided by the FSD modelling approach for LES that is the basis for our work.
4. Results and discussion
In the following section the LES results are compared to the experimental data for both the isothermal and reacting cases, and their accuracy is discussed. An analysis of the effect of stratifica￾tion is also presented.
4.1. Isothermal flow
A detailed study of the isothermal flow of the TSF burner and its sensitivity to the effects of varying the Smagorinsky constant, the inflow length-scales, the filter width and sampling period, as well as the consequences of imposing different mean radial profiles, was carried out [43]. From this, coarse (filter-width D = 1.0 mm) and fine (D = 0.5 mm) grids were chosen, with an inflow length-scale of 2 mm for the inflow generator. Despite the fine grid producing more accurate results, the coarse grid was deemed sufficiently accurate to describe the flow field for the isother￾mal flow, and thus was retained to perform initial reactive simulations. Grid convergence was based on comparison of both grids. The effect of varying the turbulent viscosity was minimal, and as such the value of 0.173 was retained for the Smagorin￾sky constant, avoiding the additional cost of using a dynamic modelling approach such as Ger￾mano’s [44]. The axial and radial mean and fluctu￾ating velocities are compared to experimental values for the fine grid in Figs. 3 and 4, and it is observed that the simulation agrees well with the experimental data.
4.2. Non-stratified reacting flow
In order to provide an intermediate stepbetween the isothermal case A _ i2, and the strati- fied case A _r, the simpler premixed case G _r was considered. Correct simulation of G _ r verifies the implementation of the modelling approach thus far, and serves as a basis for comparison with the stratified case A _ r. Only velocity data is avail￾able for this case, and this is compared to results from the fine grid simulations in Figs. 5 and 6. The mean axial velocities are correctly represented by the simulations, with an overestimation of the flow towards the centreline at 50 mm from the outlet, which is explained by the heat losses observed in the pilot tube, which have not been considered in the simulation. The mean radial velocities also show a similar shape to the experi￾mental values, with deviations that represent a discrepancy of less than 3% of the bulk velocity. Overall, despite some minor differences, it can be that the flow field in case G_r is well￾predicted by the simulation 
4.3. Stratified reacting flow 
Axial and radial velocity data from the fine grid simulation of stratified case A _ r are also com￾pared to experimental data in Figs. 5 and 6. Both quantities are sufficiently well represented by the simulations throughout, with deviations of a sim￾ilar size and nature to those discussed for case G _ r. Temperature and mixture fraction data for this case are also compared to the experimental data in Figs. 7 and 8. The mean mixture fraction at 45 mm appears to under-predict the experimen￾tal value at the pilot; however, this seems unlikely, since the experimental value here is higher than the value at the inflow (marked by a dashed line in the plot). At the same time, the mixture fraction variance would be expected to be zero in the homogeneous region near the burner and the centreline. The temperature field is also well repre￾sented by the simulation, although the fluctua￾tions are under-predicted at 100 mm despite the accurate mean values. The simulated temperature and mixture fraction profiles for case G _ r were included in these plots to provide a qualitative comparison.
4.4. Impact of stratification
It has been shown in the previous sections that the flow fields in the TSF burner under both non￾stratified and stratified conditions are well repre￾sented by the simulations. This section focuses on analysing and presenting scalar field data and ends that would be non-trivial to study experimentally. Two types of stratification exist, namely back￾supported and front-supported, with the former occurring when the flame-front propagates towards a leaner mixture, and the latter when the propagation is directed towards a richer mix￾ture. Despite a back-supported flame propagating towards a leaner mixture, and hence a region with a lower local laminar flame speed, back-supported flames have been shown to locally accelerate the laminar flame speed, with the opposite being true for a front-supported flame [5,6]. By taking statis￾tics on T3 and observing the mean fields of the progress variable and the mixture fraction, it is possible to estimate the location where the cross￾scalar dissipation rate will become significant, and where stratification will occur. A plot of the mean value of the ratio of T3 to the whole source term ðT3 þ x ~ _ Þ is shown in Fig. 9, at a location 50,100 and 150 mm downstream of the burner exit, where stratification was expected. However, this shows that the impact of T3 on the total source is low, although arguably non-negligible. A scatter plot of ~ z against ~ c at a similar location (100 mm downstream, 40 mm from the central axis) is presented in Fig. 10, showing the wide range of ~z found in the unburnt state, whereas a fully burnt state is only achieved for mixture frac￾tions exceeding 0.03. The models employed in the simulation assume that the flame propagates through a locally homo￾geneous mixture. To assess the validity of this assumption, scatter plots of jr~ zj against ~ c (also normalised by D on the secondary axis) have been studied at several locations in the flow field where stratification was expected. Due to space con￾straints only one representative location is reported here, as shown in Fig. 11. The maximumnormalised gradients (the change over a single cell) in the mixture fraction are of around 1%, which, considering our range of mixture fractions (0– 4.9%), corresponds to changes of less than 20% within a cell. The laminar flame speed does not change much with this [6], and depends almost lin￾early on ~ z in the region considered, so that there is no need for a sub-grid model for the filtered lami￾nar flame speed (i.e. zÞ). Furthermore, the majority of the scatter points lie within a range of gradients (0–0.2%) corresponding to a normalised gradient of around 4%, in which shifts of flame speed due to local stratification are expected to be low.
In an attempt to show the stratification modes found in the A _ r flame, a scatter plot of the direc￾tions of the two-dimensional (axial and radial) gradient components of ~ z and ~ c was studied at a representative location in the flow field, as shown in Fig. 12. The plot also indicates iso-lines of max￾imum stratification (when the flame is propagat￾ing in the same direction as the gradient of ~ z) and iso-lines of no stratification (when the flame propagates perpendicular to the direction of the gradient of ~ z). A negative ~ c gradient direction indi￾cates the local flame propagation is in the same direction as the bulk propagation, away from the centreline (henceforth referred to as normal propagation). Conversely, a positive ~ c gradient direction indicates the flame is locally propagating towards the centreline, and hence the flame must be locally wrinkled (henceforth referred to as wrinkled propagation). Under normal local flame propagation, a negative ~z gradient direction will represent locally a back-supported flame (bottom left quadrant), or a front-supported flame for a positive ~ z gradient (top left quadrant), provided the two gradients are not perpendicular to each other. The opposite is true for a locally wrinkled flame: back-supported stratification occurs with a positive ~ z gradient (top-right quadrant), and vice-versa. The scatter data recorded in the simu￾lation closely matches what one could estimate from the burner geometry and operating condi￾tions: the data-points are mainly clustered around the iso-line of maximum back-supported stratifi- cation, with the most frequent occurrence being under normal propagation; however, a consider￾able amount of back-supported wrinkled propaga￾tion is also observed. A small degree of front￾supported stratification is also seen, as illustrated by the distribution presented in Fig. 13: this shows the normalised frequency of the occurrence of stratification, obtained by the absolute difference of the directions of r~ c and r~ z，grouping normal and wrinkled propagation. At p/2 the gradients of ~ c and ~ z are perpendicular so no stratification occurs, whereas the region p/2 ! 0 corresponds to increasing back-supported stratification and conversely p/2 ! p indicates increasing front-sup￾ported stratification. Figure 13 illustrates how a strong back-supported stratification is dominant, despite the occurrence of some front-supported stratification and no stratification at this represen￾tative location.
Finally, a basic time-series analysis of ~ z and ~ c and their correlation was also performed by integrating the auto-correlation functions of their signals, using a standard definition [36]. The cross￾correlation between ~ z and ~ c was found to be 0.55, showing a significant correlation of the two sca￾lars. The time-scales of ~ z and ~ c were found to be 0.46 ms and 0.69 ms, respectively.
5. Conclusions 
LES of the Darmstadt stratified flame series was performed for three cases: isothermal A _ i2, reactive G _ r, and stratified reactive A _ r. The sim￾ulations of the isothermal case were compared to LDV and PIV data for the axial and radial mean and fluctuating velocities, showing an excellent agreement. The reactive cases G _ r and A _ r were also compared to these velocity measurements, showing good agreement, despite some slight dif￾ferences which have been discussed. Temperature and mixture fraction data for the stratified com￾bustion case A _r have been compared to experi￾mental data in terms of its mean and fluctuating values, showing a very good agreement, and with justification of the resulting deviations. Addition￾ally, it was shown that the cross-scalar dissipation term (T3) has a relatively small, yet non-negligible, influence on the total source term. Furthermore a basic time-series analysis was included to show the significant correlation between the reaction pro￾gress variable ~ c and the mixture fraction ~ z, and their different time-scales. Finally, a detailed anal￾ysis of the mode and strength of the stratification  occurring at a selected location was presented, finding back-supported stratification to be indeed more likely. It can also be concluded that Fure￾by’s simple and computationally efficient FSD modelling approach with a mixture fraction dependent laminar flame speed can indeed providevery good predictions for the Darmstadt stratified flame series.

Numerical analysis of flame stabilization for a steady premixed jet in vitiated coflow
Abstract
Premixed staged combustion in gas-turbine combustors, where a premixed fuel–air mixture is injected into a hot vitiated environment, has promise for better emission control. In these hot environments that occur at high engine pressure, the flames may stabilize by a combination of autoignition and premixed flame propagation. In this work, a laminar and steady premixed jet in vitiated coflow was studied numer￾ically to examine the stability behavior of such flames that are impacted by both autoignition and flame propagation. Simulations with detailed chemistry were used with boundary conditions matching previous experiments to understand the stability mechanisms. At the conditions studied, the laminar flame was lifted, with the region of highest heat release rates occurring downstream of the jet exit. However, non￾zero heat release rates an order-of-magnitude below the maximum value were observed continuously to the jet exit. An energy budget analysis was conducted along streamlines through different portions of the flame. Streamlines flowing through relatively low heat release rate regions near the burner exit were only influenced by mixing between the jet and vitiated coflow. Streamlines which flowed through higher heat release rates in the lifted flame were influenced by heat transfer from both the coflow and the existing flame, leading to heat-transfer assisted propagating premixed-flame behavior. Species budgets in the low- and high-heat release regions of the flames were also used to characterize autoigni￾tion locations. The species budget through autoignition regions showed clear markers such as high CH2O concentrations present ahead of high heat release rates. The streamlines through premixed propagation regions of the flame also had high CH2O concentrations upstream of the high heat release region, but the species budget shows this is due to mixing from autoignition regions as opposed to reactions occurring on the streamline ahead of the flame. Thus, caution must be taken when using CH2O as a marker for autoignition in such flames with mixed stabilization modes.
1. Introduction
Modern gas turbine engines are subject to increasing restric￾tions on pollutant emissions, which has led to design changes to either improve efficiency or separately reduce pollutant pro￾duction. Efficiency can be improved by increasing the pressure ratios, while additional pollutant reduction can be achieved by distributing the heat release such that high local temperatures are reduced . As one example, the Technology for Advanced Low NOx (TALON) combustor utilizes a rich swirl burner to provide a stable burning flame into which axially-staged air is in￾jected downstream to locally extinguish the rich flame and permit downstream burning under lean conditions. Pollutant emissions are lessened by transitioning from rich to lean conditions quickly with reduced high temperature heat release at stoichiometric conditions; however, the mixture must still pass through stoichio￾metric conditions briefly. Alternatively, the use of fully premixed staged combustion where premixed jets are injected into a flow of hot vitiated products can completely eliminate stoichiometric burning conditions. Safety has been a factor in avoiding premixed injection since this increases the potential for flashback. How￾ever, staged premixing has been demonstrated as in the Twin Annular Premixed Swirler (TAPS) combustor. Since the peak temperature can be controlled based on the equivalence ratio, pollutant emissions can be significantly reduced. When a premixed mixture is injected into a sufficiently hot environment, autoignition is a potential stabilization mechanism. However, the conditions for autoignition are complicated by non￾homogeneous fuel and temperature distributions. 
In an example non-reacting mixing layer , where the mixture fraction (Z) is defined as unity in the premixed injected reactants and zero in the vitiated products, there is a tradeoff between temperature (T) and mixture fraction. Nearer to the vitiated environment, where the mixture fraction is low, there are high temperatures that promote fast autoignition but low fuel concentrations that produce low amounts of total heat release. Closer to the premixed injection, where the mixture fraction is high and there is suffi- cient fuel and air for high heat release, the temperature is low, suggesting slow autoignition. This creates a challenging problem in determining locations where autoignition will provide overall flame stabilization when competing species and temperature gra￾dients are present in the mixture. This type of environment will be present in gas-turbine engines with premixed injection and is also present in reheat-style burners, which utilize hot combustion gas recirculation to stabilize the flame within a combustor. Prior numerical studies of non-premixed fuel jets injected into hot oxidizing environments found that autoignition occurred at the so-called ‘most reactive’ mixture fraction, defined as the mixture fraction with the shortest ignition delay time. The current paper examines a representative problem where a cold premixed jet is issued into a sufficiently hot vitiated coflow such that the mixture will autoignite.
Homogeneous autoignition studies typically examine specific fuel to air ratios at fixed temperatures where a defined ignition delay time is characterized. Higher temperatures and mix￾tures closer to stoichiometric conditions typically lead to shorter ignition delay times because the reaction rate exponentially in￾creases with temperature. In non-homogenous flows, where mix￾ing occurs between a jet containing fuel and a hot oxidizing coflow, a most reactive mixture fraction can be defined where there is a minimum ignition delay time based on homogeneous chemical kinetics. Most relevant work regarding autoignition in non￾homogeneous high temperature flows has been conducted with pure fuel jets issuing into a hot environment with a sufficient amount of residual oxygen such that combustion can take place. Due to the exponential dependence of the reaction rate on temperature, low mixture fractions often are the most reac￾tive mixture fraction. However, very little heat release occurs in these highly reactive regions because there is not much fuel present and may not produce stable burning conditions. In addi￾tion to autoignition, partially premixed propagation can also oc￾cur simultaneously with a lifted flame front propagating against the non-homogeneous fuel and air mixture . Since the result￾ing flame is lifted, mixing occurs upstream between the fuel and oxidizer environment that leads to an equivalence ratio gradient ahead of the flame base, which in non-premixed flames can lead to edge flame propagation. Many studies with fuel jets in￾jected into hot environments identified whether partially premixed propagation or autoignition was the dominant stabilization mech￾anism but did not address autoignition location or its local condi￾tions. Cabra et al. were among the first to study fueled-jet flame stability in vitiated flows in a laboratory setting. Although the measurements were inconclusive whether autoignition was the dominant stabilization mode, a direct numerical study (DNS) study using similar conditions as n confirmed that autoignition was occurring due to the production of preheating radical pools ahead of the flame base. Gordon et al. performed hydroxyl (OH) and formaldehyde (CH2O) planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) on similar conditions as in which radical pools of CH2O were found ahead of the primary burning region, followed by high OH production with low levels of CH2O in the flame. The observations of CH2O forming ahead of OH was consistent with autoignition nu￾merical simulations. Arndt et al. studied the transient process of a turbulent fuel jet injected into a vitiated coflow. High speed Rayleigh scattering was used to quantify the mixture fraction and temperature at the initiating kernel development. The leading au￾toignition kernel was found in regions of low scalar dissipation rate and mixture fraction, in agreement with chemical simulations of the most reactive mixture fraction. Unlike these prior studies with pure fuel injection, a premixed jet injected into vitiated products requires only heat to ignite the mixture and high mixture fractions retain a high heat release potential; thus different conditions for autoignition are expected in comparison to a pure fuel jet. Premixed jets in hot coflow and crossflows are relevant to future gas-turbine engine design but have been studied only recently. Schmitt et al. ex￾amined a premixed jet injected into vitiated crossflow and found that the jet immediately ignited upon entering the test section. They attributed this to a horseshoe vortex penetrating into the jet, which ignited inside the jet tube itself. Wagner et al. studied similar conditions that instead led to lifted and unsteady flames where the flame was found to be autoignition assisted. Later work used simultaneous particle image velocimetry (PIV) with OH and CH2O PLIF and found three burning regimes. In one of the regimes, CH2O was found to be produced well upstream of the OH flame base, similar to [19] where a radical buildup occurred ahead of the reaction zone, suggesting that autoignition was important in the flame stabilization behavior. Although there have been many observations of autoignition type behavior in such flames, a thorough understanding of how autoignition and premixed flame propagation each contribute to stabilization in these flames is challenged by unsteady flame propagation in turbulent flows. The present work aims to better identify autoignition and understand the processes which transition from autoignition to that of a premixed flame in these non-homogeneous conditions by study￾ing a laminar steady flame. Previous related experimental work studied a laminar and steady premixed jet in vitiated coflow and found autoignition characteristics ahead of the high heat release lifted flame base. The current paper serves as an extension which uses numerical simulations to calculate the solution of a similar geometry with comparable boundary conditions to better understand details related to the stabilization of this flame and the competition between autoignition and flame propagation. Although the conditions used in this work are at lower pressure and velocity than engine applications, the fundamental understanding from these simplified conditions helps understand how flames stabilize in conditions where autoignition and partially premixed flame propagation both contribute. The understanding from this work can be applied to more complicated conditions and flowfields.
2. Numerical setup
2.1. Burner design
The jet in coflow burner used for this study is shown , which replicates the geometry from previous experimental work. The burner consists of two coannular nozzles where the outer nozzle provides vitiated products, while the inner nozzle provides room-temperature premixed reactants. In the experiment, sepa￾rate (jet and coflow) fresh reactants are supplied to the bottom of an enclosed burner. The coflow reactants flow through a flame arrestor that stabilizes a flame and provides the coflow vitiated products. The coflow products flow through a ceramic converg￾ing nozzle to create a uniform exit flowfield. The experimental burner is equipped with a 3.8 mm inner diameter jet which flows straight through a 50 mm diameter outer nozzle. The gas exiting the burner flows into room-air conditions at 1 atm. This geom￾etry was replicated in the computational domain with an addi￾tional 100 mm low velocity (1 cm/s) air jet to simulate surround￾ing quiescent air. The computational domain extended 150 mm inthe axial direction, which should fully encompass the lifted flame since the flames from were lifted approximately 10 mm. To simplify the interpretation of the results, the wall between the jet and coflow that existed in the experiments was simulated as a knife edge to eliminate any recirculation zone downstream of the jet wall. All experimental cases from [42] produced a laminar and steady lifted flame, leading to two-dimensional axial symme￾try. The computational domain origin is located at the jet center atthe nozzle exit plane. 
Although several boundary conditions were examined in, a specific case was chosen for the detailed numerical study here.The jet was modeled as an ethylene-air mixture with an equiv￾alence ratio of 0.75 at 300 K. The coflow was modeled by cal￾culating the chemical equilibrium state of a 0.7 equivalence ratiopropane-air mixture, which underwent heat loss to bring the tem￾perature down to 1500 K, for consistency with. Both the jetand coflow were simulated with a plug-flow 5 m/s velocity pro-file. Simulations of the temperature, heat release rate, and mixture fields for this case are shown in Fig. 3. The Reynolds num￾ber for the jet and coflow were 1210 and 1060, respectively, based on the gas velocity, jet or coflow diameter and the local viscosity. All experiments and simulations were performed at atmospheric conditions.
2.2. Numerical scheme
The left edge of the computational domain was modeled as an axis of symmetry while the top and right edges were modeled as pressure outlets. The individual species concentrations and tem￾peratures were input at the coflow exit as well as both pressure outlets to model backflow conditions. The mesh had a uniform 100 μm resolution in the axial direction. The resolution varied in the radial direction. At radial locations between the centerline and 2.5 mm, the resolution was 50 μm to ensure high resolution of the mixing layer. The grid spacing beyond 2.5 mm in the radial direction monotonically increased to 100 μm resolution, and re￾mained constant until reaching a radial distance of 5 mm. Radial locations exceeding 5 mm monotonically increased again, reaching a maximum grid spacing of 8 mm in the ambient air region of the computational domain, to reduce the computational cost. The flame thickness, using the initial conditions of the jet, was esti￾mated to be 600 μm using Cantera. 
The UNsteady Ignition and COmbustion with ReactioNs (UNI￾CORN) [44–46] solver was used in this work. This code solved the Navier–Stokes, energy, and species conservation equations in cylin￾drical coordinates. The equations were solved by integrating the governing equations on a staggered grid. The momentum equa￾tions were solved using the third-order accurate QUICKEST scheme while the energy and species equations were solved using a hy￾brid upwind and central differencing scheme. Additional details are available in [44]. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number was set to 0.5 to avoid numerical instabilities. The steady-state solu￾tion was obtained by iterating each time-dependent solution until residuals reached a constant value of close to machine precision. Time steps were taken until steady state was reached. The San￾Diego mechanism was used to model the ethylene-air com￾bustion chemistry, which uses 52 species and 272 reactions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. General observations
The heat release was calculated by multiplying the reaction rates and enthalpy of combustion for each individual reaction. The heat production from each reaction was summed . The bottom edge of the computational domain from 0 to 1.9 mm in the radial direction is the jet exit and the hot coflow exists beyond 1.9 mm. Both the jet and coflow are flowing in the positive axial direction with the same velocity magnitude. Streamlines passing through the flame have local peaks in heat release rate that are at high axial loca￾tions for streamlines originating near the centerline where little mixing occurs with the coflow. For streamlines originating near the coflow, significant mixing with burned coflow products decreases the peak heat release rate on that streamline. The dotted black line follows the local maximum heat release at each axial height. The solid lines are streamlines which intersect the maxi￾mum heat release line at the location of 15%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 90% of the global maximum heat release rate. These streamlines are equivalent to the streamlines that intersect the lowest point on a given heat release isocontour. The streamlines were chosen to reflect changes in the flame stability as demonstrated further throughout this paper. Percentages of the maximum heat release rate are used to define the streamline locations for generality. The maximum heat release rate occurred near a = 20, where the flame seemingly acts as a premixed flame. Locations on the flame closer to the jet exit have lower heat release rate, due to smaller fuel concentrations as indicated in the mixture fraction contour plot. Although non-zero heat release rates exist at all axial heights, for low heights the magnitude is an order of magnitude or more below the peak heat release rate. The 15% of maximum heat release contour is lifted a few mm above the jet exit and 90% heat release contour begins approximately 14 mm above the jet exit in the axial direction, as observed in Fig. 3. Beyond 14 mm the flame nearly acts as a premixed flame, maintaining a nearly con￾stant Bunsen angle and approximately constant heat release mag￾nitude. The flame stabilization region is proposed to extend be￾tween 3.5 and 7.5 mm in the axial direction, as supported by the detailed analysis in this paper, and including the regions with ap￾proximately 15–50% of the maximum heat release rate. Upstream of the 15% maximum heat release contour, there is still heat being released all the way to the burner exit, although, it is small when compared to the heat released from the down￾stream region. Therefore, this inherently brings up questions for these flames: at what point does this flame begin, where is it stabilized, and what is the stabilization mechanism? Observations from show the flame visually lifted,  if the flame is defined as regions with a large heat release rate magnitude. However, since there is on the order of 108 W/m3 of heat being produced near the jet exit, is this flame lifted or at￾tached? One distinguishing feature is that the low heat release rate near the burner exit likely cannot be sustained without the pres￾ence of the coflow providing suitable heat transfer, whereas the downstream premixed flame provides sufficient feedback of heat and species to the incoming jet reactants to allow the mixture to continuously ignite like a normal propagating premixed flame. A key question addressed in this research is therefore: where does the flame transition from being supported by the coflow to being supported by only the existing premixed flame and what is the role of autoignition in that transition? Temperature profiles along the same streamlines that are plot￾ted in Fig. 4 are shown in Fig. 5. Since the 15% heat release stream￾line originates in the coflow, the temperature starts at 1500 K, ini￾tially decreases as it mixes with the cooler jet fluid and increases as reactions take place. All other streamlines originate from the jet, begin at 300 K and essentially linearly increase in temperature prior to rapidly rising in temperature. The regime where the tem￾perature linearly increases is dominated by diffusive heat exchange between the two interacting flows (shown subsequently). The sub￾sequent rapid rise in temperature occurs near the flame reaction layer, implying diffusion from the flame front or reactions are heat￾ing the flow in this region. The sample streamline which passes through 15% of the maximum heat release approaches a minimum temperature around 1200 K before increasing. Prior to this, close to the jet exit, there is a decrease in temperature as the fluid parcel mixes with cold jet fluid. The subsequent increase in temperature is gradual, unlike a strongly burning premixed flame. Streamlines with greater heat release maxima have much lower temperatures prior to a quick rise in temperature that is more indicative of a propagating premixed flame. Therefore, it is unlikely that the plot￾ted streamlines which pass through 50% of the maximum heat re￾lease or greater autoignite since they do not reach suitable temper￾atures prior to a quick rise in temperature. Conversely, the lower heat release streamlines are not consistent with flame propagation since they do not have a rapid rise in temperature at a flame front. One goal of better understanding this type of autoignition￾assisted flame is the ability to predict the liftoff height, as it will impact the locations of flame stabilization in practical combus￾tors. Several studies have observed that the flow time to the sta￾bilization region for premixed jets in vitiated environments was much longer than the ignition delay time from autoignition cal￾culations of the most reactive mixture fraction. The difference in flow time to the stabilization point and the au￾toignition time for the most reactive mixture fraction was approxi￾mately an order of magnitude. To further examine this discrepancy, zero-dimensional chemical-kinetic simulations were performed us￾ing Cantera and the San-Diego mechanism , consistent with the mechanism used in UNICORN, to characterize the igni￾tion delay time for select homogeneous. The calculation sequence is depicted in Fig. 6, which represents infinitely fast mix￾ing of jet and coflow fluid to a defined mixture composition fol￾lowed by reactions without further mixing, similar to prior calcu￾lations of autoignition times for the most reactive mixture fraction. The coflow mixture composition was determined by calcu￾lating the chemical equilibrium state of the coflow inlet boundary conditions with an imposed temperature that matches the exper￾imental value from. The jet fluid composition was set based on the known jet equivalence ratio. The jet and coflow composi￾tions were adiabatically mixed defined by Z, given in Eq. (1). In Eq. (1), mJ is the mass of premixed jet fluid and mCo is the mass of coflow fluid in the mixture. Chemical kinetic simulations were performed for Z values ranging from 0 to 1 to examine the reac￾tions taking place from mixtures originating from the coflow to jet, res ectively. These mixtures were then simulated in a plug flow re￾actor (PFR) where a time marching scheme was used to compute the time evolution of the reacting fluid. The ignition delay time was defined based on the time to reach the maximum heat release.It shows the autoignition times for these ideal condi￾tions with Z values ranging from 0.1 to 0.4. Mixtures greater than Z = 0.4 did not autoignite, and therefore were not shown. These were compared to flow times from the full 2-D UNICORN simu￾lation of the flame. The flow times are computed by defining the reaction layer as the 108 W/m3 heat release isocontour and com￾puting the residence time from the exit of the burner to this con￾tour for different streamlines. The mixture fraction for that stream￾line was calculated using a mass weighted average of the normal￾ized elemental mass fractions at the point where this streamline intersects the heat release isocontour. These flow time values are compared against the 0-D autoignition time scales i. The 0-D simulations show the homogenous ignition delay time for Z less than 0.2 is approximately 100 μs or less, which leases a larger amount of heat, but requires a longer ignition de￾lay time. Therefore, the actual stabilization point in the experiment and simulation with gradients in Z is impacted by this trade off. In the 2-D simulation for low mixture fractions, the flow time to the flame is approximately 250 μs and is longer than the most reac￾tive mixture fraction delay time from the 0-D simulations. The flow time is much flatter with respect to mixture fraction than the auto￾ignition time from the 0-D simulations. However, once autoignition occurs and the flame is stabilized at some location, downstream lo￾cations within the premixed jet can propagate as premixed flames as apparent . It suggests that stabilization can be viewed as occurring at the intersection of the two lines where the time scale for au￾toignition of the mixture matches the residence time along the streamline, but this ignores effects of cross-stream mixing. The ef￾fects of cross-stream mixing can be clearly observed from the 15% heat release streamline. The streamline originates in the coflow and therefore needs time to mix with the jet to obtain fuel. Thus, the non-homogenous mixing effects may play an important role in elongating the overall ignition delay time.
3.2. Energy equation analysis
A more thorough analysis of this flame was conducted from the full 2-D simulations using the energy budget to determine the rel￾ative contribution of each energy term along various streamlines. This is similar to the analysis conducted in. The steady-state energy equation is given in Eq. (2) in cylindrical coordinates, where ρ is the density, cp is the specific heat capacity at constant pres￾sure, Vr is the radial velocity, T is the temperature, Va is the axial velocity, λ is the thermal conductivity, Ji is the flux of mass dif￾fusion, ω˙ i is the reaction rate of the i th reaction, this is the en￾thalpy of combustion for the ith reaction, and r and a are the ra￾dial and axial directions, respectively. The energy budget along a streamline can help understand the physical processes for a fluid particle approaching the flame. The energy balance in Eq. (2) can be transformed into the local normal and tangential components along the streamline, shown in Eq. (3), where η is the normal di￾rection and τ is the tangential direction. In the calculations τ was defined as positive in the direction of the flow and η was rotated by negative 90°. Therefore, at the jet exit the tangential compo￾nent is in the positive axial direction and the normal component is in the positive radial direction, which points towards the coflow. The λ/r term and the enthalpy transport by species diffusion term, Ji , are negligible as verified in the full calculations and were neglected in Eq. (3). Also, since there is no flow normal to the streamline, the normal advective heat flux component is zero. The energy budget which passes through the 90% heat release contour is shown. Far upstream of the reaction layer there is no energy transport in this isothermal region of the flow. How￾ever, in the nearfield of the reaction layer, the fluid element is dif￾fusively heated by the downstream reaction layer and is balanced by the advective heat flux. Upon reaching the reaction layer the fluid is heated by the chemical heat release and the diffusive term becomes negative representing a loss to upstream fluids elements. The energy budget along this streamline resembles a typical pre￾mixed flame.  
It also shows diffusion in the normal direction (across streamlines). Unlike a planar premixed flame, the diffusive term is dominated by the normal component with only a small amount from the component along the streamline. Therefore, the fluid is pre-heated by neighboring streamlines which originate closer to the coflow and have already reacted. From Figs. 3 and 4, it can be seen that the streamlines enter the premixed flame at an an￾gle, which leads to this dominant diffusion in the cross-stream direction. This is similar to a classic angled Bunsen flame. Anal￾ysis of the energy budget in coordinates aligned with the flame surface was also conducted (not shown). These results show the same overall balance between diffusive and reactive transport at the flame, but the presented streamline coordinates provide addi￾tional clarity for other regions of this flame with stronger advective flux. The energy budget for the streamline crossing the 50% of max￾imum heat release is shown. Far upstream of the reaction layer, the mixture is diffusively heated normal to the streamline. The heat gain is nearly constant and is balanced by the tangen￾tial advective heat flux, for similar reasons as in It. In the re￾gion where the diffusive heating is nearly constant, It shows the temperature increasing almost linearly. An increase in diffusive heating occurs close to the reaction layer, which is due to the high temperature reaction layer, similar to the 90% streamline. The ax￾ial locations where the diffusive heating increases correspond to the locations with a rapid temperature rise. Therefore, the fluid along this streamline is still aided by the diffusive heating from the flame. The flame, however, contributed significantly less heat than in the 90% streamline. Instead, preheating by the coflowupstream of the reaction layer aided in allowing the streamline to reach temperatures necessary for reactions. Therefore, this region
could be classified as a premixed flame aided by preheating from the hot coflow. The 50% of the maximum heat release streamline clearly has an influence from both the flame and from diffusive heating from the coflow, but the relative influences are not quantitatively clear just from Fig. 9. Two types of diffusive heat transfer are expected to contribute for the given flame configuration: diffusive heat gain from the high temperature coflow, and heat transfer from the sta￾bilized downstream flame. While the energy budget can quantify the total heat gain from diffusion, it does not differentiate be￾tween the two types of diffusive heat transfer. In order to re￾solve this, a post-processing calculation of the same flow without reactions was conducted. This calculation was performed by re￾solving the energy equation by removing heat release and species enthalpy transport terms but using the local diffusive and spe￾cific heat properties, and local velocities from the full simulation with reactions. Thus, only the energy equation is re-solved and the resulting analysis of this temperature field compared to the full field with reactions quantitatively separates the effects of diffu￾sive heat flux from the coflow while neglecting diffusive heat flux from the flame. The calculation was performed by importing rel￾evant flow properties from the full 2-D simulation into MATLAB and solving a non-reacting energy equation for the balance be￾tween diffusive and advective heat fluxes with the velocity and transport properties imposed from the full simulation. The calcu￾lation used the Gauss-Seidel iteration scheme with successive un￾der relaxation. A non-reacting test case was simulated in UNI￾CORN and compared to the results from this numerical procedure. Maximum temperature differences were approximately 30 K, and maximum diffusive heat fluxes differences were 107 W/m3. Since the diffusive heat flux in the reacting simulations are on the or￾der of 109 W/m3 , this accuracy should be sufficient to resolve the diffusive heat flux contributions from the flame and coflow. The discrepancies from resolving the temperature were attributed to interpolating the simulation parameters, differences in spatial dis￾cretization, and differences in numerical procedures. The temper￾ature that was calculated using this method will be referred to as the non-reacting temperature field throughout the remainder of this section.
It shows the resulting energy budget, which has been further broken into normal diffusive heat fluxes from the coflow and flame. The heat flux from the non-reacting calculation is shown as the dotted line, which corresponds to the heat flux contribution from the coflow via diffusion only, and the dashed￾dotted line is the difference in the diffusive heat flux from the reacting case and the non-reacting case. Thus, at low axial posi￾tions the diffusive heating is dominated by mixing between the
jet and coflow, as expected. At approximately 5 mm the diffu￾sive heat flux from the flame begins to make a contribution to the overall heat flux, and by 6 mm is dominating the diffusive heating. The energy budget for a streamline which passes through 15% of the maximum heat release rate is shown. Unlike the 50% streamline, this streamline begins in the coflow and is diffu￾sively cooled by mixing with the jet, thus the results indicate a negative (heat loss) diffusive flux from the coflow after computing the non-reacting temperature field. The diffusive heat loss at lo￾cations close to the jet exit (a ~ 0.5 mm) have high loss rates in comparison to the heat gain along the 50% streamline. The diffusive heat flux magnitude decays with axial height as the temperature gradient is reduced by mixing. Heat release exists at all heights on the streamline but peaks at 4 mm. The structure of this heat release is significantly different than that shown along the 50% streamline. In that, the diffusive flux from the flame preheats the incoming flow leading to a rapid increase in the heat release rate; consistent with a propagating premixed flame structure. In Fig. 11, the diffusive heating from the flame is never positive along the streamline, implying that the heat gen￾eration along this streamline is lost to neighboring streamlines by diffusion. Therefore, the fluid along this particular streamline is not aided by heat transfer from the heat release region. Instead, this streamline is diffusively cooled by mixing with the jet, resulting in an increased fuel concentration prior to spontaneous heat release. This streamline is representative of an autoigniting mixture since the fluid element requires no heat from an existing flame to spon￾taneously react and gains the necessary conditions for heat release from mixing between the vitiated coflow and premixed fuel and air jet.
Observations concerning the provided streamline energy bud￾gets support the following understanding for the stability of this flame. Streamlines originating close to the vitiated coflow passing through less than 15% of the maximum heat release rate, have a net loss of heat to the jet fluid via diffusion. These locations ac￾quire fuel and air from the jet and are at sufficiently high tem￾peratures to produce significant heat release. However, these lo￾cations have a net heat loss to the flame itself, and further, are not expected to be self-sustaining since the high temperatures can only be attributed to the high initial temperature of the coflow. Streamlines between the 15% and 50% maximum heat release con￾tours transition to conditions that are preheated by the coflow but are also preheated by the flame initiated between the jet and coflow fluid. Transitioning from the 50% to 90% maximum heat release streamlines, the fluid elements feel less of an effect
from the coflow and are heated primarily by the presence of the flame behaving like a propagating premixed flame. Near the 90% maximum heat release streamlines and beyond, the fluid is only heated by the flame, and has nearly no direct interaction with the coflow. The progress variable was also computed and is overlaid on Figs. 8–11 to indicate the extent of burning in the different regimes. The progress variable was determined by computing the adiabatic flame temperature at each specific location and normal￾izing this temperature from zero to unity, where zero is 300 K and unity is the local adiabatic flame temperature.
The streamlines used thus far are exam
ples to identify differ￾ent burning behaviors. These behaviors can be further defined to identify the boundaries between the three burning regimes. The identifying feature of pure autoignition behavior in Fig. 11 was that ∂ lame < 0, that is the fluid received no positive heat transfer from the downstream flame. Therefore, autoignition burn￾ing is defined here when ∂  lame < 0. The term ∂∂η (λTη)f lame was sampled along the reaction layer until determining that the diffusive heating from the flame became positive. The transition between autoignition and heat-transfer assisted propagation using this definition was determined to occur approximately at the 15% maximum heat release streamline. The transition between heat￾transfer assisted propagation and fully premixed flame propagation can be determined by defining a parameter, ζ , which describes the heat a fluid parcel accumulates along a streamline. Its com￾ponents, ζ flame and ζ coflow, are defined as lameds and lowds, respectively, where s is the distance along the streamline. For streamlines originating near the centerline, where there is no heat transfer from the coflow, ζ flame will reach an upper limit while ζ coflow will be nearly zero. The remaining flow field can be normalized by the maximum ζ flame value to determine the rel￾ative heat transfer contribution from the flame. Figure 12(a) shows ζ flame along with the 15% and 85% streamlines. ζ flame and ζ coflow were sampled along the maximum heat release contour, indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 12(a), and are shown in Fig. 12(b). This plot shows the heat that was accumulated for the two compo￾nents of diffusive heat flux along the streamline prior to the region of largest heat release. Comparing ζ flame and ζ coflow at these loca￾tions shows the relative contribution each had on heating the fluid parcel to reacting temperatures. The normalized ζ flame, shown in that, approaches unity near a = 14 mm, which corresponds to ~85% of maximum heat release. In addition, near 14 mm ζ flame is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than ζ coflow, im￾plying that the coflow had a minimal influence in heating the fluid along this streamline. Thus, the transition from heated propagation to fully premixed propagation occurs at approximately 85% of the maximum heat release streamline, using the definition provided above. This analysis could be extended to unsteady and turbulent simulations by solving one additional equation that determines the effective non-reacting heat transfer from the flame. For large simu￾lations that cannot store sufficient information for post processing, analysis of cumulative heat transfer would need to be done in a Lagrangian manner by tracking fluid parcels at select locations dur￾ing the simulation. This would be analogous to the current stream￾line analysis since this flow is steady. Extension of this analysis to experimental measurements would be limited given the need to resolve 3D advective fluxes, which can be extracted from velocity measurements and diffuse fluxes. Chemical explosive modal analysis (CEMA) was also inves￾tigated to determine the notable similarities and differences to the energy analysis. The largest eigenvalue of the chemical Jacobian matrix was calculated at each grid point as shown. The presence of chemical explosive modes (CEM) are indicated when the eigenvalue is large. Streamlines that pass through high heat release rates have low eigenvalues at low axial heights except near
the reaction layer, shown in Fig. 13(b). This indicates little propen￾sity to ignite until reaching the reaction layer, similar to that seen in standard premixed flames. Streamlines that pass through low heat release rates, for instance the 15% of maximum heat re￾lease rate, have high eigenvalues at low axial positions prior to reaching the peak heat release region. This behavior is similar to that under autoignition conditions. Interestingly, the 50% max￾imum heat release streamline shows very similar behavior as the 90% case. This indicates that although there is significant preheat￾ing prior to reacting, the chemical propensity to ignition is low, in agreement with the energy analysis performed and supporting the interpretation of this region of the flame as heat-transfer assisted premixed flame propagation.
Flame speeds were calculated in the different regimes by sam￾pling the velocity upstream of the reaction zone and determining the normal component with respect to the flame. Interestingly, the heat-transfer assisted regime exceeded the flame speed in the fully premixed regime. Although the heat release rate and fuel concen￾tration were lower in the heat-transfer assisted regime, the tem￾perature was also higher, as seen in Fig. 5, which led to 50% higher propagation speeds. While the flame speed is higher, the total ac￾cumulated heat release in the heat transfer assisted regime was 36.1% of the entire heat release, as compared to 59.4% for the fully premixed regime. Moreover, the autoignition regime contributed 4.5% to the total heat release, indicating that this regime does not add much heat to the entire flowfield but aids in stabilizing the flame. One other question to explore with this simulation addresses the difference in autoignition delay time from zero-dimensional chemical kinetic simulations, and the flow times corresponding to the lift off height of this flame and similar flames from the literature. The energy analysis here shows a key characteristic along the streamlines which is different than the PFR calculations. Since the fluid element is continually mixing between the jet and coflow, there are differences in the fluid state compared to the PFR calculations, which are adiabatic and non-mixing. The autoignition region of this flame has a net heat loss to other regions of the flow, thus, early heat release and radical formation is depleted by diffusion, which results in an additional delay in the autoignition time. The ignition delay times from the PFR calculations do not capture this mixing between regions leading to the discrepancy in the au￾toignition and flow times.
3.3. Species analysis
CH2O and OH have been important experimental markers for identifying autoignition and heat release characteristics. Mass fractions of OH and CH2O are shown in Fig. 14 with similar streamline and local maximum heat release line as in Fig. 4. Axial heights at approximately 8 mm and above show consistencies with
premixed flame-type behavior. Above 8 mm, CH2O is produced in the preheat region near the flame and quickly consumed, where large concentrations of OH are present in the reaction layer and post-combustion region. Therefore, this region is consistent with premixed flame behavior and shows little influence of transport from the coflow, consistent with Fig. 8. Streamlines ahead of the reaction layer have negligible influence from the coflow and pro￾duce negligible amounts of preheat radicals upstream of the pre￾heat layer, also consistent with premixed flame behavior. Axial heights less than 8 mm show significantly different be￾havior. OH is produced in smaller concentrations upon passing through the flame, indicating smaller fuel concentrations and over￾all heat release than in the premixed flame region. CH2O on the other hand is produced in higher concentrations, and approaches peak values at an axial position as low as approximately 6 mm. Since CH2O is present in the preheat region, there is a significantly elongated preheating region ahead of the flame in the streamwise direction. High CH2O formation far ahead of the flame is often used to indicate autoignition locations [19], and is consistent with Fig. 11. Similar to Section 3.2, a species budget can be analyzed along different streamlines. Eq. (4) shows the species budget, where Dim is the species diffusion coefficient between species i and m, where m is nitrogen for the purposes of this analysis, and Yi is the mass fraction of species i. Fig. 15 shows the species budget and CH2O mass fraction along the 15% maximum heat release streamline. As indicated earlier, the 15% maximum heat release streamline is a streamline which undergoes pure autoignition behavior (no posi￾tive heat flux from the flame). In Fig. 15, the mass fraction of CH2O increases quickly within the first 0.5 mm. Moreover, the rise in CH2O concentration is due to local production which is balanced by diffusion and advection. Observations from Fig. 11 show that relatively high heat release rates associated with the reaction layer begins around 2.5 mm. The high concentration of CH2O due toreactions occurring far upstream of the high heat release rates is consistent with this streamline being autoignition dominated. A similar analysis was conducted on the streamline which passes through 50% of the maximum heat release and is shown in Fig. 16. Similar to the 15% streamline, there is significant CH2O concentration upstream of the high heat release region. How￾ever, observations from Fig. 10 showed that this streamline is not an autoignition dominated streamline. Upon further inspection of Fig. 16 there is a balance between diffusion and advection which increases the CH2O concentration upstream of the reaction layer. Nearing the reaction layer, there is a large increase in CH2O con￾centration due to reactions which are subsequently consumed. The lack of CH2O production upstream of reactions indicates that the CH2O concentration upstream of the reaction layer is only present due to transport from neighboring streamlines. The use of CH2O as an indicator for autoignition events therefore can be mislead￾ing in such non-homogeneous mixtures since CH2O is not only present due to reactions but also can be transported from adja￾cent autoignition regions. Thus, caution must be taken when using CH2O PLIF measurements to identify autoignition regions upstream of the flame.
4. Summary and conclusions
A premixed jet in vitiated coflow was simulated to better un￾derstand autoignition stabilized flame behavior. Spatial locations of hof high heat release rates indicate a lifted flame, in agreement with the corresponding experimental flame which is visually lifted. Conversely, low heat release rates on the order of 108 W/m3 were observed immediately at the jet exit and monotonically in￾creased into the flame. Ignition delay times from homogenous and adiabatic chemical kinetic simulations were compared to flow times to reach the flame in the full 2-D numerical simulation of the flame. The flow times to the reaction layer were larger than the homogenous ignition delay time, indicating that these homo￾geneous simulations are insufficient in describing the location of flame stabilization. Analysis of terms in the energy equation show that streamlines passing through high heat release rates had similar behavior as typical premixed flames. However, streamlines which pass through intermediate heat release rate regions showed effects of preheat￾ing from the coflow upstream of the flame, indicating heat-transfer assisted-premixed flame propagation. At relatively low heat release rates, the streamlines were dominated by heat release from au￾toignition and net heat loss via mixing to other regions in the flow. Transition points were identified between these regions to char￾acterize the locations of autoignition, autoignition assisted flame propagation and premixed flame propagation. Analysis of species transport were consistent with these tran￾sitions. In the premixed flame region, CH2O was produced only in the preheat region of the flame and quickly consumed in the reaction layer. The CH2O budget along an autoignition streamline showed high CH2O concentrations far upstream of the highest heat release rate, consistent with radical pool buildup in autoignition. However, the streamlines which were identified as autoignition￾assisted flame propagation had relatively high CH2O concentrations upstream of the flame, suggesting autoignition, but this was due to transport from neighboring streamlines as opposed to local pro￾duction. Therefore, caution needs to be taken when using CH2O concentration as an indicator for autoignition.

Revisiting diacetyl and acetic acid ?ames: The role of the ketene + OH reaction
ABSTRACT
The mechanism of the reaction of ketene with hydroxyl radical has been studied by ab initio CCSD(T) F12/cc-pVQZ-F12//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) calculations of the potential energy surface. Temperature and pressure-dependent reaction rate constants have been computed using the RRKM-Master Equation and transition state theory methods in the temperature range of 300每3000 K and in the pressure range of 0.01每100 atm. Three main channels have been analyzed: through direct abstraction of H atoms or starting with OH addition to the terminal carbon and to the central carbon atoms. Major products identi?ed agree with the recent theoretical studies, however, signi?cant difference was found with the rate constants derived by Xu et al. and Cavallotti et al. To investigate the impact of the choice of reactions between CH2CO and OH radicals on the predicted burning velocities of the ?ames sensitive to ketene chemistry, namely diacetyl and acetic acid ?ames, a detailed kinetic mechanism was updated with pertinent reactions suggested in the literature. Then the rate constants of four most important product channels of reaction CH2CO + OH forming HCCO + H2O, CH2OH + CO, CH3 + CO2 and CH2COOH from the present and from the recent theoretical studies were tested. Good agreement with the burning velocities of diacetyl + air ?ames was found for the present model, while the expressions from the literature underestimate them. On the contrary, any combination of the rate constants of reactions between ketene and hydroxyl radical overpredicts burning velocities of acetic acid + air ?ames, which strongly indicates that the kinetic model of acetic acid is most probably incomplete and requires consideration of additional reactions.
INTRODUCTION
A common feature of combustion chemistry of diacetyl, (butane-2,3-dione, (CH3CO)2), and acetic acid, CH3CO2H, is the formation of signi?cant concentrations of ketene that allows for pinpointing important aspects of CH2CO conversion through experimental and theoretical analysis of pertinent reactions. Therefore, several studies focusing on reactivity of diacetyl and acetic acid have been performed quite recently and kinetic mechanisms including updated ketene chemistry have been developed. Earlier analyses of high-temperature diacetyl reactions focused on its pyrolysis until the ?rst ?ame study by Christensen and Konnov. Yang et al. investigated dissociation of (CH3CO)2 in a shock tube and determined pressure-dependent rate constant of the initial decomposition step. Moreover, a kinetic model for diacetyl pyrolysis has been proposed aiming at prediction of formation of methyl radicals in shock tube kinetic studies. This mechanism was extended by reactions of diacetyl oxidation to calculate burning velocity of diacetyl + air ?ames measured using the heat ?ux method. Particular attention in that study was paid to updates of ketene sub-mechanism and its validation by comparison with available experimental data on ketene pyrolysis and oxidation. The model closely reproduced burning velocity in lean and rich mixtures while underpredicted it in stoichiometric and slightly rich ?ames. The focus of the recent work of Zhang et al. was on methyl-related carbon chain growth reactions during pyrolysis of diacetyl from low to high pressures. The sub-mechanism for (CH3CO)2 decomposition was very similar to that suggested by Yang et al. One important mistake, which originates from the misprint in was spotted by Zhang et al. in the low-pressure rate constant of reaction implemented in the model of Christensen and Konnov. Most recently Sun et al. investigated diacetyl ?ame structure at low pressure using probe sampling and time-of-?ight mass spectrometer. They performed theoretical calculations of several important abstraction rate constants and introduced pressure-dependent reaction of decomposition which in other models was assumed to be instantaneous.
Sun et al. also improved the model proposed earlier implementing several rate constants relevant to diacetyl and acetic acid decomposition calculated in their earlier study. The chemistry of acetic acid is of importance in combustion of some oxygenated fuels, namely ethyl esters and acetates. These esters may decompose directly forming CH3 CO2 H, and therefore pertinent sub-mechanism suggested by Christensen and Konnov was incorporated into recent kinetic models for esters and further developed using theoretical calculations. Speci?cally, Cavallotti et al. calculated rate constants of H abstraction reactions from acetic acid by radicals and found them somewhat different from previous theoretical study by Mendes et al. Moreover, pressure-dependent acetic acid decomposition reactions and addition reactions of the key radical CH2 CO2 H + H have been obtained. Finally, decomposition of CH2 CO2 H and reactions between ketene and OH on the same potential energy surface were explored and pressure-dependent rate constants have been derived. All these updates will be explored in the present work.
Simultaneously, Xu et al. studied the same system of CH2 CO + OH and calculated rate constants of different reactions channels. Detailed comparison of the theoretical studies by Cavallotti et al. and Xu et al. reveals that predicted rate constants are not very close as will be shown in the following. On the other hand, in the study of CH3 CO2 H chemistry it was concluded that the mechanism performance in prediction of the burning velocities of acetic acid ?ames could be improved by revision of reactions between CH2 CO and OH radicals, while keeping its agreement with other ?ames studied. The goal of the present study was therefore threefold: (a) to calculate the rate constants of ketene + OH, (b) to update detailed kinetic mechanism of the authors by reactions of acetic acid and diacetyl suggested in the literature and mentioned above, and (c) to investigate the impact of the choice of reactions between CH2 CO and OH radicals on the predicted burning velocities of the ?ames most sensitive to ketene chemistry.
METHOD
Geometries of the reactants, products, transition states, and reaction intermediates in the reactions of ketene with radical OH have been optimized using the hybrid density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP and doubly hybrid DFT B2PLYPD3 methods with the 6-311G(d,p) and Dunning＊s cc-pVTZ basis sets, respectively. Vibrational frequencies have been computed at the same levels of theory to characterize stationary points as local minima or transition states, to obtain zero-point vibrational energy corrections (ZPE), and to be utilized in partition function calculations. However, the B2PLYPD3 method gave unrealistic imaginary frequencies for some transition states and hence, B3LYP geometries and frequencies were chosen for the evaluation of rate constants including calculations of partition functions and tunneling corrections. The connections between transition states and local minima were veri?ed and con?rmed by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. All DFT calculations were performed employing the Gaussian 09 program package. Further, the B3LYP optimized geometries, which appeared to be very similar to those obtained at the B2PLYPD3 level, were used to re?ne single-point energies using the explicitly-correlated coupled clusters CCSD(T)-F12 method with the cc-pVQZ-F12 basis set; the MOLPRO package was utilized for these calculations. The CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVQZ F12 approach closely approximates CCSD(T)/CBS energies and it is expected that the accuracy of the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVQZ F12//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) + ZPE(B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)) relative energies should be within 0.7 kcal/mol or better. Two versions of CCSD(T) were tested, restricted open-shell ROCCSD(T)-F12 and unrestricted UCCSD(T)-F12, both based on the ROHF initial wave function. While for most structures the differences between ROCCSD(T)-F12 and UCCSD(T)-F12 relative energies were very small (within 0.1每0.3 kcal/mol), these differences appeared to be signi?cant for the critical entrance transition states TS(i1-i2) and TS(i1-i4) connecting the reactant van der Waals complex H2 CCO＃OH (i1) with covalently bound intermediates i2 and i4.
We selected to use UCCSD(T)-F12 energies for these transition states following the recommendation by Harding, Klippenstein and coworkers who carefully analyzed the performance of different ab initio methods for reactive potential surfaces. They found in particular that for radicals UCCSD(T) normally performs somewhat better than ROCCSD(T) providing a closer agreement with the benchmark full CI results or with the most accurate multireference CASPT2 values. In our calculations, the best agreement with the available experimental data (see Section 3.4) for reaction rate constants was found with UCCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVQZ-F12 single point energies for TS(i1-i2) and TS(i1-i4). T1 diagnostics was used to monitor whether the wavefunctions of the calculated structures possess a signi?cant multireference character. Only one structure, TS(i1-P1) for direct H abstraction by OH to form H2 O, was found with a large T1 diagnostics value exceeding 0.03. Therefore, for this structure we performed muti-reference perturbation theory CASPT2 calculations with the active space including 17 electrons distributed on 13 orbitals (17,13); this active space contained all valence electrons and all valence orbitals (23,19) excluding those corresponding to C每H and O每H bonds and respective antibonding orbitals (6,6). The multistate CASPT2 calculations included 3 electronic states of the species considered, i.e., the CH2 CO + OH super molecule, i1, and TS(i1-P1). The use of the IPEA shift of 0.25 and the standard MOLPRO level shift of 0.2 in the CASPT2 calculations did not affect the relative energies signi?cantly. The CASPT2(17,13) calculations were carried out with the cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets and the energy was then extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit using the two-point extrapolation:
In order to determine the relative energy of TS(i1-P1), the CASPT2(17,13)/CBS calculations were also carried out for the re actants, ketene + OH, considering them as a super molecule, i.e., as two non-interacting fragments (with geometries optimized for isolated species) separated by a large distance. Noteworthy, if the i1 complex instead of the super molecule is used as a reference in CASPT2 calculations of the relative energy of TS (i1-P1), the result is not affected. The CASPT2(17,13)/CBS barrier height at TS(i1-P1), 4.8 kcal/mol relative to the reactants computed using multistate calculations with 3 electronic states included, appeared to be lower than the values reported in the previous works, 8.7 kcal/mol at G3(MP2) and 6.5 kcal/mol at the composite UCCSD(T)-F12/cc pVTZ-F12 level with an MP2-F12 correction to the cc-pVQZ-F12 basis set. It should be noted however that the CASPT2 barrier height varies between 2.8 and 6.4 kcal/mol depending on the number of states included in the CASPT2 calculations and therefore the uncertainty of the this barrier height is likely ㊣ 2 kcal/mol. Temperature and pressure-dependent rate constants for the re actions considered were evaluated within the framework of RRKM theory in combination with the Master Equation approach (RRKM ME). The MESS code was used for the rate constant calculations in the temperature range of 30 0每30 0 0 K and in the pressure range of 0.01每100 atm. The rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation (RRHO) was employed in partition function calculations. ※Soft§ vibrational modes, which can be characterized as intramolecular rotations and have low vibrational frequencies, were treated as hindered rotors. The internal rotational potentials for the hindered rotors were evaluated using B3LYP/6 311G(d,p) calculations. For the submerged transition states TS(i1 i2) and TS(i1-i4), variational transition state theory (VTST) calculations were performed, i.e., the IRC minimal energy reaction path (MEP) was mapped at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level and single-point energies of the IRC structures were re?ned using the UCCSD(T) F12/cc-pVQZ-F12 method based on the ROHF initial wavefunction. The IRC structures were included as transition state candidates in variational calculations by the MESS package. Tunneling corrections using asymmetric Eckart potentials were included in rate constant calculations. As will be seen below, tunneling may play a signi?cant only at low temperatures for the H abstraction channel leading to the HCCO + H 2 O products since the other important reaction channels are controlled by the submerged transition states TS(i1-i2) and TS(i1-i4). The H abstraction channel does not con tribute to the overall reaction outcome substantially at low temperatures and hence more sophisticated treatment of tunneling was not pursued. Collision parameters, such as Lennard-Jones parameters needed for the calculation of the pressure dependence of rate constants were taken from Jasper＊s database for C 2 H 3 O 2 ( 汍/cm ?1, 考 / ?A) = (1762.424, 4.104) and N 2 ( 汍/cm ?1, 考 / ?A) = (68.0, 3.610). Since the entrance channel in the reaction of ketene with hydroxyl radical to form the van der Waals complex i1 is barrierless, we used phase space theory to generate its high pressure limit rate constant. The phase space theory rate constants were then combined with RRKM rate constants for other reactions on the potential energy surface (PES) in RRKM-ME calculations. The potential prefactor and power exponent were selected in such a way that the association rate constant for ketene + OH ↙ i1 at the high pressure limit was close to the gas-kinetics limit of ~2 ℅ 10 ?10 cm 3 molecule ?1 s ?1. However, the actual values of the 
association rate constant and the rate constant for the reverse re action of dissociation of i1 back to the reactants are not relevant at considered temperatures above 300 K when the equilibrium between the reactants and the rather weakly bound complex i1 is rapidly established. Under such conditions, the high-pressure limit rate constant e.g., for ketene + OH ↙ i2, can be expressed as Thus, under the conditions where the pre-equilibrium between the reactants and i1 has been established, the rate constant k (R-i2) depends only on the partition functions of the reactants Q R and the most important calculated rate constants were ?tted to modi?ed three-parameter Arrhenius equations. The RRKM-ME the oretical approach employed in the present study is capable of computing temperature and pressure-dependent rate coe?cients with ＆kinetic accuracy＊, i.e., with accuracies comparable to that of experiment, typically within a factor of 2 or better. The exception is the H abstraction channel, where the relatively high uncertainty in the entrance barrier height increases the uncertainty of the calculated rate constant, especially at low temperatures.
RESULT and DISCUSSION
At the ?rst stage of the interaction of the OH radical with ketene, an intermolecular complex i1 is formed, which further decomposes due to chemical processes between ketene and OH. Noteworthy, we found two possible reactant complexes, a planar structure i1 where a hydrogen bond is formed between H of OH and O of ketene and non-planar i1＊ with a hydrogen bond between O of OH and H of ketene. While i1＊ was found in, the present calculations show i1 to be very slightly (by 0.05 kcal/mol) more stable than i1＊. The reaction of ketene with OH can then proceed by the following 3 channels, where channels 2 and 3 have several different products: Channel 1 is carried out by the abstraction of H atom from ketene by the OH radical and leads to the formation of a water molecule and ketenyl radical. Channel 2 proceeds by the OH addition to the terminal carbon atom followed by the formation of ?ve different products: CO + CH 2 OH, H + OHCHCO, H + (HCO) 2, HCO + H 2 CO, and CH(HCO)OH. Channel 3 involves the OH addition to the central carbon atom eventually leading to the formation of two different products: CO + H 3 CO and CO 2 + CH 3. Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Material show optimized geometries of intermediates and transition states along with their notations, which will be used from here on. The calculated total energies of all species at the B3LYP and CCSD(T)-F12 levels, ZPE, symmetry point groups, electronic terms, rotational symmetry numbers, the number of optical isomers, and imaginary frequencies (for transition states, TS) are assembled in Table S1 in the Supplemental Material. Note that we did not consider product complexes here, which were studied and presented in, since they are not expected to play a signi?cant role in the reaction kinetics under combustion conditions. Figure 1 depicts the pro?le of the PES. PES was studied earlier by Hou et al., Xu et al., and in part by Cavallotti et al., and the relative energies from these works are also shown in Fig. 1 for comparison. Our results are in a close agreement with 
the values from and except for channel 1 (due to a multireference character of the transition state noted above), and the present calculation method, CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVQZ-F12 is generally more accurate than the G3(MP2) approach used by Hou et al. According to the present results, channel 1 proceeds via a bar rier of 4.8 ㊣ 2 kcal/mol. Channels 2 and 3 exhibit submerged entrance barriers following the formation of the van der Waals com plex i1. Channel 2 proceeds via an intermediate i2, after which it is divided into several subchannels. However, only subchannel 2a leading to the formation of CO and CH 2 OH passes through only one low barrier. Alternatively, subchannels 2b-2f exhibit high barriers in the 36.5每53.0 kcal/mol range and therefore are unlikely to provide meaningful contributions to the total product yield. As shown by rate constant calculations below, the only product that is formed in signi?cant quantities through channel 2 is CO and CH 2 OH. Channel 3 also has a submerged entrance barrier leading to an intermediate i4 residing in a deep potential well. Therefore, one can expect that i4 can be stabilized and thermalized by collisions or dissociate back to the reactants. This radical intermediate, if stabilized, can participate in bimolecular reactions with other molecules or radicals available or undergo unimolecular dis sociation, also preferably back to ketene + OH. After the formation of the intermediate i5 channel 3 diverges to several subchannels. However, subchannel 3a has a lower barrier than 3b and 3c, so it can be expected that the products CH 3 and CO 2 are likely to prevail along this reaction channel. Interestingly, while the relative energy of TS(i5-P7) computed here is very close to the values reported i and ( Fig. 1 ), the present energy of i5 is ~3 kcal/mol lower than the result in but identical to the value in  13 . The i5 ↙ TS(i5-P7) ↙ CH 3 + CO 2 dissociation channel is peculiar because both i5 and the transition state have planar structures, but different electronic states, 2 A§ and 2 A＊, respectively. IRC calculations without symmetry constraints con?rmed that TS(i5-P7) connects i5 and P7 via a pathway along which the planar symmetry is broken. In the meantime, an excited 2 A＊ electronic state of i5 is computed to lie 15.7 kcal/mol above the ground 2 A§ state. The overall reaction rate constants computed as a sum of rate constants of all reaction channels and branching ratios of individual products calculated at the atmospheric pressure are collected in Table S2, whereas Fig. S3 in the Supplemental Material illustrates the products branching ratios at different pressures. One can see that the main product in the entire considered range of temperatures and pressures is CO + CH 2 OH. Even at high temperatures, its branching ratio exceeds or is close to 50% up to 2400 K decreasing to 41% at 30 0 0 K. The hydrogen abstraction channel 1 producing a water molecule and a ketenyl radical gives a second largest contribution at high temperatures, with the branching ratio of about 21% at 1500 K and 56% at 30 0 0 K. The dependence of the branching ratio of CO 2 + CH 3 on temperature shows a maximum 
of ~11% at 10 0 0每130 0 K and 1 atm. The branching ratio of the intermediate i4 (CH 2 COOH) increases with pressure and at 1 atm has its maximal values at temperatures 50 0每60 0 K and then decreases. The remaining products have negligible branching ratios. With this overall picture of the product distribution in mind, below we discuss calculated rate constants for individual product channels and compare them with rate expressions used in current kinetic models. It should be noted that in the recent studies some rate constants related to ketene + OH were not calculated theoretically, but were estimated through thermochemical methods, as will be speci?ed in the following.
Modi?ed Arrhenius expressions for the formation of the ketenyl + H 2 O products are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 2 illustrates temperature dependence of the rate constant of reaction CH 2 CO + OH = HCCO + H 2 O and compares the calculated ex pression with the literature data. As can be seen from the ?gure, the rate constants increase with increasing temperature. The calculated rate constant here is independent of pressure. The low-temperature values are particularly sensitive to the barrier height which, as discussed above, have a signi?cant uncertainty of ㊣ 2 kcal/mol. When the ＆central＊ value of 4.8 kcal/mol is used obtained by three-state CASPT2 calculations, the rate constant at 300 K computed here is a factor of 20.6 higher that the value obtained in. The difference between the two sets of values remain signi?cant at higher temperatures but decreases to fac tors of 4.9, 3.6, and 3.1 at 10 0 0, 20 0 0, and 30 0 0 K, respectively. On the other hand, the present rate constant computed with the 4.8 kcal/mol barrier agrees within a factor of 2 with the values obtained from the rate expression in above 700 K. Similar agreement within a factor of 2 is also seen with rate expression proposed in in the 90 0每220 0 K temperature range. The uncertainty in the calculated rate constant caused by the uncertainty in the barrier height is large at low temperatures up to 10 0 0 K. However, at these temperatures, the contribution of the H abstraction channel to the total reaction rate constant is small and does not exceed 0.1% at 300 K and is ~7% at 10 0 0 K. The uncertainty in the rate constant decreases at higher temperatures. For instance, at 10 0 0 K and above the values computed with the barrier heights of 2.8 and 4.8 kcal/mol agree within 30%. Alternatively, the rate constant calculated with the barrier height of 6.4 kcal/mol is factors 4.5每2.3 lower at 10 0 0每30 0 0 K but is close to the values computed Channel 2 can produce ?ve different product pairs including CO + CH 2 OH, H + OHCHCO, H + (HCO) 2, HCO + H 2 CO, and a stabilized CH(HCO)OH intermediate. However, only the formation of CO + CH 2 OH has a high branching ratio, the branching ratios of the remaining products are insigni?cant. Our calculations show that the rate constants for the formation of CO + CH 2 OH, H + OHCHCO, H + (HCO) 2, and HCO + H 2 CO are nearly independent of pressure, whereas the dependence of the rate constant for the stabilization of CH(HCO)OH on temperature at different pressures is shown in Fig. S4d in the Supplemental Material. Modi?ed Arrhenius expressions for the formation of CO + CH 2 OH, H + OHCHCO, H + (HCO) 2, HCO + H 2 CO and CH(HCO)OH are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 3 illustrates temperature dependence of the rate constant of reaction 
CH 2 CO + OH = CO + CH 2 OH and compares the calculated expression with the literature data. Experimentally, only Grussdorf et al. determined branching ratios in the reaction between ketene and OH, which was later substantiated by ab initio calculations of Hou et al. Other measurements yielded overall rate constants at temperatures close to the room one. Since the branching ratio for CO + CH 2 OH at these conditions is above 80%(see Fig. S3) these values are also shown in Fig. 3.
One can see that our results for the rate constant of CO + CH 2 OH formation are in a good agreement with experimental data. As the temperature rises, the rate constant at ?rst slightly decreases up to 500 K, but then noticeably increases at higher temperatures. A similar trend at low temperatures was ob served earlier experimentally. This behavior can be reproduced only if the barrier at TS(i1-i2) is submerged, i.e., if this transition states lies lower in energy than the reactants. Restricted open-shell ROCCSD(T)-F12 calculations gave a slightly positive relative energy for TS(i1-i2), whereas the UCCSD(T)-F12 approach gave a negative energy. The inclusion of variational effects for this tran sition state does not affect the low-temperature values substantially but decreases the high-temperature values by 25%, 58%, and 75% at T = 10 0 0, 20 0 0, and 30 0 0 K, respectively. Although the energetics for channel 1 calculated in the present work is within 0.3 kcal/mol from the values obtained recently in, the calculated rate constants disagree by up to a factor of 6.4 at 300 K. The present values are higher and closer to the available experimental data. Both calculations here and in show a similar trend with temperature. The calculated rate constant of the minor HCO + H 2 CO channel is rather small and therefore it was not considered in other modeling studies. However, using input ?le for the MESS code provided in the Supplemental material to the work of Xu et al.one may retrieve the values of this rate constant. These values agree within a factor of 2 with our expression listed in Table 1. Channel 3 leads to the formation of two bimolecular products, CO 2 + CH 3 and CO + CH 3 O; in addition, the collisionally stabilized intermediate i4 can be also formed through this channel. The formation of CO + CH 3 O is insigni?cant, but CO 2 + CH 3 represents an important product. Modi?ed Arrhenius expressions for the formation of the products of channel 3 are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Note that variational effects for the submerged entrance channel TS(i1-i4) do not in?uence the calculated rate constants for channel 3 signi?cantly. The dependence of the reaction rate constants for CO 2 + CH 3 and intermediate i4 on temperature at different pressures is shown in Fig. S4 in the Supplemental Material. The reaction rate constant for CO 2 + CH 3 increases with temperature and decreases with pressure. The dependence of the rate constants for the formation of these products on temperature at the pressure of 1 atm is given in comparison with the literature data in Fig. 4. Again, the calculated behavior differs from the previous literature estimation but shows a reasonably close agreement with the results of theoretical studies. Note that Cavallotti et al calculated this rate constant at temperatures above 700 K. The different trend is observed for the stabilized intermediate i4 (CH 2 COOH); the reaction rate constant does not change or slightly increases with temperature at low temperatures (below 600 K) and decreases with increasing temperature at the temperatures relevant to combustion (10 0 0 K and above) as shown in Fig. 5. Also, the rate constant for the formation of i4 always increases with pressure. Estimated rate constant and theoretical calculations  11, 13  are also shown in Fig. 5. Cavallotti et al. calculated this rate constant in the reverse direction. For comparison, the rate of recombination was calculated using their reverse rate and thermo data for CH 2 COOH (also accepted in the present model) taken from. The present kinetic model consists of 1797 reactions and 162 species and is based on the most recent Konnov mechanism provided by Capriolo et al. with some important modi?cation introduced by Konnov. Speci?cally, the termolecular reactions associated to hydrogen oxidation, namely, H + O 2 + R suggested by Klippenstein and Burke were included in the mechanism; furthermore, transport properties for a large number of molecules and radicals were updated using calculations of Jasper et al. Reactions introduced and/or revisited in the present tudy are listed in Table 3 and described below. Note that several pressure-dependent rate constants are incorporated in the mechanism using PLOG function and without ( + M) notation, while Table 3 shows only expressions at 1 atm. 4.1. Reactions of diacetyl Zhang et al. recently investigated pyrolysis of diacetyl and largely adopted pertinent mechanism from Yang et al. They noted important mistake in the low-pressure rate constant of re action implemented in the model of Christensen and Konnov due to numerous misprints in the original pape; now this rate constant is correctly listed in Table 3. Using probe sampling and time-of-?ight mass spectrometer Sun et al. investigated the structure of a low pressure diacetyl ?ame. In the previous models for diacetyl it was assumed that CH 2 COCOCH 3 radicals formed by abstracting H atoms decompose immediately forming ketene and acetyl. Sun et al. introduced pressure-dependent reaction of decomposition. Thermodynamic data for CH 3 COCOCH 2 have been also adopted from Sun et al. Moreover, they performed theoretical calculations of important abstraction rate constants by H atoms ( R13) and CH 3 radicals (R14), as well as displacement reactions. It was demonstrated that introducing the latter reaction al lows for much better prediction of the acetaldehyde pro?le in di acetyl ?ame as compared to the model of Christensen and Konnov. For other abstraction reactions by C 2 H 5, O, OH, HO 2, and O 2 the same rate constants as suggested earlier were kept, however ketene and acetyl radicals in the products were replaced by CH 2 COCOCH 3. Finally, to evaluate possible role of displacement re action with OH, (CH 3 CO) 2 + OH = CH 3 CO + CH 3 CO 2 H (R17) 
it was included in the present model with estimated rate constant. 4.2. Reactions of acetic acid. Although the work of Sun et al. was focused on diacetyl ?ame chemistry they also proposed to implement several rate constants relevant to acetic acid decomposition calculated in their earlier study. However, Cavallotti et al revisited this system also theoretically and found signi?cant departure from the results of Sun et al. It was argued that the level theory used in is higher than that in, and therefore most of the rate constants calculated by Cavallotti et al. are adopted here. Only isomerisation and decomposition of 1,1-ethenediol not covered in yet included in our model with the rate constants previously taken from Clark et al. H abstraction reactions ( R24 )每(R32) were also presented in as forward reactions only, moreover, CH 3 CO 2 was assumed to decompose immediately, forming CH 3 + CO 2. These reactions were all made reversible in the present work and radical CH 3 CO 2 was considered as a product, where appropriate. Cavallotti et al. compared their calculated rate constants with the previous theoretical study by Mendes et al. and in most cases found differences within a factor of 2. However, considerable divergence from Mendes et al. was observed for H abstraction by H carboxyl group and for H abstraction by OH attributing these differences to the higher level of theory used i. For both channels of reaction with OH Cavallotti et al. showed in Supporting Information of that their rate constants are higher by a factor of 2.5每4. Regrettably, this Supporting Information contains two mistakes. First, the rate constant of reaction ( R24) derived by Mendes et al. is actually higher (by about 10%) compared to that of as shown in Fig. 6. The rate expression of reaction ( R29) listed in Table S6 of is also lower than that from  12  that contradicts to the good agreement between experimental data of Khamaganov et al. and the total rate shown in Fig. 4 of  11 . This contradiction was re solved by digitizing the rate constant of reaction ( R29) from Fig. S5f of  11 , which yields expression listed in Table 3 and shown in Fig. 6. The total rate constant of reaction CH 3 CO 2 H + OH derived in 11 is then in good agreement with available experiments at least up to 700 K.
High and low-pressure limiting expressions for reaction (R-38) obtained by Wagner and Zabel was adopted in the mechanism of Christensen and Konnov and in other models. Friedrichs and Wagner implemented frequency modulation spectroscopy to detect singlet methylene during decomposition of ketene in a shock tube. They summarised previous works, and suggested to use pressure-dependent rate constant of recombination based on RRKM calculations, which is adopted in the present mechanism. Reactions of ketene with CH 3 and CH 2 radicals have been investigated in our recent theoretical studies and all pertinent channels with calculated rate constants have been implemented in the present model. hey are included in the present mechanism for completeness that requires additional reactions of their consumption to make the model consistent. The last two species were incorporated in the mechanism of Battin-Leclerc et al. mostly with estimated rate constants. In the present model reactions of HOCHCO were added and sub-mechanism of glyoxal was up dated largely relying on the studies of Fa?heber et al. and of Friedrichs et al. The sub-mechanism of formic acid, HCOOH, which is formed in some reactions of these three species, was also updated mainly following the work of Marshall and Glarborg. None of these reactions affects calculated burning velocities, therefore the choice of their rate constant is presented in the Supple mental material. Modeling was performed using ANSYS Chemkin 17.0 software. The laminar burning velocity was simulated using the premixed laminar ?ame speed calculation module with multicomponent transport and thermal diffusion options taken into account. Radiative heat losses were also considered in the simulations since they may affect calculated burning velocities of slowly burning ?ames. The radiation model considers the radiation from CO 2 and H 2 O through an optically thin medium with absorption coe?cients taken from 62. The impact of the radiative heat losses on the calculated burning velocity was typically smaller than 0.2 cm/s. A grid independent solution was ensured by setting the parameters GRAD and CURV to values of 0.03 and 0.02, respectively, resulting in a typical number of grid points above 600 over the domain of 3 cm. 
In the following three models will be tested and compared with experimental data for burning velocities of diacetyl and acetic acid. Present Model I includes all reactions listed in Tables 1 每3. In Model II the rate constants of reactions calculated by Cavallotti et al. were implemented; all other re actions, thermodynamic and transport parameters were not modi?ed. Similarly, in Model III the rate constants of reactions (R1), ( R2 ), ( R4) and ( R5) calculated by Xu et al. were implemented. 
The laminar burning velocities of diacetyl + air ?ames at 1 atm were determined using the heat ?ux method in non-stretched ?ames at initial gas temperatures of 298 K, 318 K, and 338 . The measurements at 298 K with associated experimental uncertainties are presented in Fig. 7, while those for 318 and 338 K are illustrated in Figs. S11 and S12, respectively. The burning velocities were obtained over 3 non-consecutive days using two different installations as described by Christensen and Konnov and therefore presented by different symbols on these plots. Calculated burning velocities of diacetyl + air ?ames using the previous and present mechanisms are also shown in Figs. 7, S11 and S12. The model of Christensen and Konnov closely reproduced experimental results in lean and rich mixtures while underpredicted them in stoichiometric and slightly rich ?ames with maximum deviation by 2每3 cm/s. Models II and III predict burning velocities very close to the result of the previous model slightly di verging from it only in rich ?ames. Model I is in a slightly better agreement with experimental data over the entire range of equivalence ratios. It should be noted that the difference between Models I, II and III is only in the rate constants of reactions ( R1 ), ( R2 ), ( R4) and ( R5) between ketene and OH, which were not present among 
sensitive for diacetyl + air ?ames as was shown earlier by Christensen and Konnov or by Sun et al. To clarify which changes affect the burning velocity of di acetyl + air ?ames the sensitivity analysis was performed using Model I as depicted in Fig. 8. Since the models I每III are only differ ent by the rate constants of 4 reactions, the sensitivity spectra for them are very similar. Comparing previous and the present sensitivity spectra, one may note that among fuel-speci?c reactions 
displacement keeps its positive impact on the burning velocity of diacetyl. The rate constants of these reactions have been updated in the current mechanism based on the study of Sun et al. For ketene, only reaction CH 2 CO + H = CH 3 + CO appeared in the earlier sensitivity spectra with negative normalized coe?cients because it converts H atoms into less reactive methyl radicals. However, reaction (R2) forming CH 2 OH + CO emerges in the present analysis ( Fig. 8) because in Model I it has signi?cantly higher rate constant (see Fig. 3) comparing to the other models. It effectively competes with the reaction between ketene and H atoms that leads to a slight increase in the predicted burning velocity. Hence, one may conclude that thanks to these and other modi?cations implemented in the present work, Model I is suitable for calculations of the burning velocities of diacetyl + air ?ames. 
The laminar burning velocities of acetic acid + air ?ames at atmospheric pressure and initial gas temperatures of 338 K, 348 K, and 358 K have been determined for the ?rst time by Christensen 
and Konnov. These experiments were accompanied by di?culties caused by the corrosiveness of acetic acid towards the burner material. However, the procedure of normalization of the apparent burning velocity values by the well-known burning velocities of methane ?ames allows to circumvent these problems. On the other hand, this approach leads to additional signi?cant uncertainty that was evaluated to be about ㊣ 2 cm/s and includes day to-day variations observed over 3 non-consecutive days using two different installations. Therefore, the measurements at 338 K presented in Fig. 9, possess two types of experimental uncertainties: smaller ones based on standard procedures described elsewhere and additional error bars due to problems just mentioned and discussed indetails in 8. Similar plots showing burning velocities at 348 and 358 K are presented in Figs. S13 and S14, respectively. Different symbols on these plots and in Fig. 9 illustrate day-to-day variations of the measurements. 
The model developed by Christensen and Konnov overpredicted measured burning velocities of acetic acid + air ?ames by about 3 cm/s that exceeded evaluated experimental uncertainty of ㊣ 2 cm/s. Modi?cations implemented in the present work and ap plied in Models I每III lead to divergent behavior as illustrated in Figs. 9, S13 and S14. Models II and III are closer to the experimental data in rich ?ames as compared to the previous mode 8 . Present Model I, however, still predicts higher burning velocities than the measurements by about 3每3.5 cm/s, which is certainly associated with different rate constants of reactions ( R1 ), ( R2 ), ( R4) and ( R5 ). To elucidate reactions responsible for the differences observed, the sensitivity analysis was performed using Model I as shown in Fig. 10. Similar to the previous analysis 8 it was found that the calculated burning velocities are mostly governed by C1 chemistry typical for all hydrocarbons and by reactions of ketene. Thus, implementation of different C0-C2 reaction subsets may lead to no table changes in the predicted burning velocities as it was demonstrated by Cavallotti et al. using various versions of the POLIMI model. Furthermore, reactions ( R1) and ( R2 ), which in the present Model I have largely different rate constants than those in Mod els II and III (see Figs. 2 and 3) directly contribute to the overprediction of the burning velocities. The differences between our calculated rate constants and previous works have been dis cussed above and can be attributed to the higher level of theory implemented in the present study for reaction ( R1 ). Reaction ( R5) not visible in Fig. 8 appears in the sensitivity spectra of acetic acid ?ames ( Fig. 10) because in the reverse direction it constitutes important channel of CH 2 COOH decomposition leading to formation of signi?cant concentrations of ketene in these ?ames. 
The calculated burning velocities can be decreased by increasing the rate constants of reactions having small negative sensitivity coe?cients. Cavallotti et al. estimated the uncertainty of their rate constants of a factor of 2 or better. However, multiplication of them by this factor is not su?cient to match experimental data and it was not implemented in the present model.
Summarizing these different options and taking into account that majority of reactions of ketene and of acetic acid have been re?ned using theoretical calculations and can hardly be changed signi?cantly, one may support the opinion of Cavallotti et al. that kinetic model of acetic acid is most probably incomplete and requires consideration of de?cient reactions of the CH 2 COOH radical. Indeed, its reactions with other radicals could provide additional chain termination reducing calculated burning velocity and modifying the balance of the intermediate products observed in several attempts to model acetic acid ?ame structure investigated by Leplat and Vandooren.
CONCLUSION
The present work was motivated by the need of updating and improving kinetic sub-mechanism of ketene, which is important for combustion modeling of hydrocarbons and oxygenated species. Direct comparison of the recent theoretical studies by Cavallotti et al. and by Xu et al. reveals that predicted rate constants of the reaction of ketene with hydroxyl radical are notably different. To resolve this ambiguity ab initio CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVQZ- F12//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) calculations of the potential energy surface for CH2 CO + OH have been performed. Temperature- and pressure- dependent reaction rate constants have been computed using the RRKM-Master Equation and transition state theory methods in the temperature range of 300每3000 K and in the pressure range of 0.01每100 atm.
Then the rate constants of four most importan product channels of reaction CH2 CO+OH forming HCCO + H2O (R1), CH2 OH + CO (R2), CH3 + CO2 (R4) and CH2 COOH (R5) from the present and from the recent theoretical studies were assessed. The differences between our calculated rate constants and previous works can be attributed to the higher level of theory implemented in the present study for reaction (R1).
Ketene is known to be important intermediate in high- temperature chemistry of diacetyl and acetic acid ?ames. To investigate the impact of the choice of reactions between CH2 CO and OH radicals on the predicted burning velocities of these ?ames, detailed kinetic mechanism was updated with pertinent reactions suggested in the literature. Furthermore, the rate constants of four most important product channels of reaction CH2 CO+OH from the present work and from the theoretical studies by Cavallotti et al. and by Xu et al. were tested and compared with available data for the burning velocities of diacetyl and acetic acid ?ames. Good agreement with the burning velocities of diacetyl + air ?ames was found for the present model, while the expressions from the literature underestimate them. On the contrary, any com- bination of the rate constants of reactions between ketene and hydroxyl radical overpredicts burning velocities of acetic acid + air ?ames, which strongly indicates that kinetic model of acetic acid is most probably incomplete and requires consideration of additional reactions.
The structure of turbulent stratified and premixed methaneairflames I Nton-swirling flows
Abstrac
A series of flames in a turbulent methane/air stratified swirl burner is presented. The degree of stratifi- cation and swirl are systematically varied to generate a matrix of experimental conditions, allowing their separate and combined effects to be investigated. Non-swirling flows are considered in the present paper, and the effects of swirl are considered in a companion paper (Part II). A mean equivalence ratio of ¼ 0:75 is used, with / for the highest level of stratification spanning 0.375–1.125. The burner features a central bluff-body to aid flame stabilization, and the influence of the induced recirculation zone is also considered. The current work focuses on non-swirling flows where two-component particle image veloc￾imetry (PIV) measurements are sufficient to characterize the main features of the flow field. Scalar data obtained from Rayleigh/Raman/CO laser induced fluorescence (CO-LIF) line measurements at 103 lm res￾olution allow the behavior of key combustion species—CH4, CO2, CO, H2, H2O and O2—to be probed within the instantaneous flame front. Simultaneous cross-planar OH-PLIF is used to determine the orientation of the instantaneous flame normal in the scalar measurement window, allowing gradients in temperature and progress variable to be angle corrected to their three dimensional values. The relationship between curvature and flame thickness is investigated using the OH-PLIF images, as well as the effect of stratifi- cation on curvature.
The main findings are that the behavior of the key combustion species in temperature space is well cap￾tured on the mean by laminar flame calculations regardless of the level of stratification. H2 and CO are significant exceptions, both appearing at elevated levels in the stratified flames. Values for surface den￾sity function and by extension thermal scalar dissipation rate are found to be substantially lower than laminar values, as the thickening of the flame due to turbulence dominates the effect of increased strain. These findings hold for both premixed and stratified flames. The current series of flames is proposed as an interesting if challenging set of test cases for existing and emerging turbulent flame models, and data are available on request.
1. Introduction
Practical combustion applications and model combustors designed to study relevant phenomena at atmospheric pressure typically operate in a stratified regime. This stratification may be intentional, giving acceptable flame stability in overall lean combustion, or it may be due to physical design constraints, which impose limits on the mixing length for the fuel and oxidizer. There has been a significant push in the combustion research community to investigate the effect of stratification due to its practical rele￾vance. This section provides a brief overview of the findings in the experimental literature; a more thorough discussion is avail￾able in [9].The effect of stratification on low turbulence, low Reynolds number lean flames has been investigated in a small number of studies. Renou et al. [10] found that stratification in￾creased the flame propagation rate in unsteady flame kernels. Fur￾ther, their work showed that the local variation in burning velocity results in increased flame front wrinkling relative to premixed flames, with a corresponding broadening of curvature distribu￾tions. Pasquier et al. [11] studied the propagation of flames through stratified lean turbulent propane mixtures in a combus￾tion bomb. They found that following ignition, the mean propaga￾tion speed in stratified flames was higher than in corresponding premixed cases with the same mean equivalence ratio ahead of the flame. They attributed this enhancement to the diffusion of heat and radicals from richer products into leaner reactants (i.e., back-supported flame propagation). Robin et al. [12] studied a rod-stabilized stratified flame. Their analysis of instantaneous flame thickness and curvature indicates that the presence of stratification in back-supported lean flames leads to a decrease in flame thickness, due to additional stretch components arising from differential flame propagation speeds. Anselmo-Filho et al. [13] used a low turbulence, rod-stabilized slot burner flame, and found that curvature distributions are broadened, and that the flame sur￾face density is increased relative to the premixed case. A number of recent experimental studies have examined results from novel turbulent stratified burners at more practically relevant turbulence levels [14–18]. Seffrin et al. [14] at Darmstadt intro￾duced an axisymmetric concentric-tube burner with a central pilot flame designed to allow the investigation of flames at moderate Reynolds numbers 104. Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and particle image velocimetry were used to characterize the velocity field for a number of operating conditions. The structure of these flames were investigated by Böhm et al. [15] using Rayleigh scattering; the resulting mean and RMS profiles of temperature indicated a higher turbulent burning speed in the pre￾mixed cases relative to the corresponding stratified cases. Examin￾ing instantaneous temperature profiles and corresponding OH-PLIF images, Böhm et al. concluded that the effect of stratification on temperature profiles is secondary to that of the actual three dimen￾sional flame geometry. Additionally they found that curvature dis￾tributions behaved similarly with stratification to those reported by Anselmo-Filho et al. [13]. Vena et al. [18] examined the effects of equivalence ratio gradients on the topology of flame fronts in a turbulent iso-octane/air V-flame. They observed variations in curvature distributions that were less significant than those re￾ported elsewhere in the methane/air literature. Their main conclu￾sion was that gradient effects on curvature may be limited in flames that are stoichiometric on the mean. The present work presents results from a series of non-swirling methane/air flames in a new turbulent swirl burner. This burner was designed to have have an open flame, facilitating high fidelity scalar measurements. The design incorporates a central bluff-body and variable swirl to emulate in part the flow complexity and flame stabilization methods seen in practical systems. These design decisions were also made in the context of providing model test cases progressively more complex and therefore complementary to those of the Darmstadt stratified burner [14,15]; the present burner is similar in that it uses a co-annular design, but imposes additional flow complexity through the inclusion of a bluff-body induced  ecirculation zone and variable swirl levels. Results from the flames surveyed are presented as follows.
The thermal and compositional structure of the flames surveyed are mapped out by radial profiles of the Favre-averaged tempera￾ture and equivalence ratio at a range of axial locations. Maps of mean and fluctuating velocity obtained from PIV measurements are used to characterize the flow field above the burner exit in reacting and non-reacting flows. Near-exit profiles of mean and fluctuating components of radial and axial velocities in non￾reacting conditions are also shown to approximate boundary conditions. Temperature-space plots of major species are then pre￾sented; data are taken from the intersection of the mixing layer (locus of / = 0.5(/i + /o)) and the mean flame brush (locus of peak RMS fluctuation of temperature) to highlight the effects of stratifi- cation on the mean behavior of these quantities. Scalar gradients, in the form of the surface density function and scalar dissipation rate, are shown in progress variable space. The influence of strati- fication on topological quantities such as flame thickness and cur￾vature is also investigated.
2. Experimental details
An overview of the swirl burner, operating conditions, and experimental methods used is provided to give context to the re￾sults presented further on in the present work.
2.1. Cambridge stratified swirl burner
The slot burner investigated by Anselmo-Filho et al. [13] and the present authors [9] provided detailed information on the ef￾fects of stratification in weakly turbulent V-flames as well as a test case suitable for simulation by DNS. It has also attracted interest from RANS modelers [19]. However, the turbulence intensity of the flames surveyed in that burner was much lower (u0 /sL  1) than those in practical combustion systems. A burner with substantially higher flow rates, velocities and tur￾bulence levels than the slot burner was designed to investigate the effect of stratification in a more representative flow. The burner was designed to provide flows with a variable degree of swirl; this was to approximate the flow conditions found in many practical applications, and to introduce a greater degree of complexity to the test case. The swirl assists flame stabilization, as in practical combustors, allowing more extreme stratified conditions to be investigated than would otherwise be possible. The swirl burner is referred to as SwB throughout the present work. The swirl burner is shown in elevation in Fig. B.1; key components are labeled and are referenced in braces, {}, in the following discussion. It consists of two annular channels through which fuel/oxidizer mixtures can flow, and a large (382 mm diameter) co-flow of filtered air to prevent the entrainment of ambient air. Air flow in the co-flow is conditioned in the follow￾ing way. First, it is passed through three perforated disks {M}, the first of which has 3 mm diameter holes with 40% open area, while the subsequent pair has 1.5 mm diameter holes with 25% open area. The flow is then straightened by passing it through a 38.1 mm deep honeycomb section {L} with 3 mm holes and 75% open area. Finally any clustered particles are filtered using two mesh gauzes {K}, the first of which has 1.2 mm square holes and 70% open area, while the second has 1 mm square holes with 40% open area. The annuli are formed by three concentric tubes {E–G}. The exit geometry is shown in Fig. B.2. The innermost tube {G} is termi￾nated in a ceramic cap {J}. This acts as a central bluff body which aids flame stabilization. The use of ceramic material ensures that heat losses to the bluff body are minimized, and the conditions are assumed to be close to adiabatic. Furthermore, the ceramic used is essentially an inert material in comparison to alternatives
such as stainless steel, with the result radical absorption and sur￾face reactions are minimized.
A locating collar {D} is used to ensure that the major axes of the tubes are coincident. The outer tube {E} and inner tube are aligned relative to the middle tube {F} using a set of three 0.6 mm diameter pins arranged at 120. Annular gap widths were uniform to within approximately 0.05 mm. The diameter of the pins was selected as a compromise between structural strength and the desire to mini￾mize disturbance to the flow. The perturbation of the flow was fur￾ther reduced by placing the locating collar 133 mm upstream of the burner exit.
Flow to the inner annulus is supplied via a plenum {A} at the base of the burner, mixing of fuel and oxidizer gases having taken place in feed lines far upstream of the burner. Though the primary purpose of the plenum is to channel flow from the supply lines to the inner annulus, it also breaks up the flow structures in the lines on entrance to the burner. The outer annulus is fed by the middle and upper plenums {B, C} in the burner. If the middle plenum {B} is used in isolation, then the resulting outer annulus flow is axial. A variable degree of swirl can be introduced to the outer flow by passing a percentage of the overall outer annulus flow through upper plenum {C}. Gas from the upper plenum joins the outer annulus through a swirl collar {I}, via a radially symmetric pattern of inlets angled at 30 to the annulus and at 30 to the horizontal. These angled jets induce a tangential component to the axial flow from the middle plenum, generating a swirling flow at the burner mouth. Flow straightening rings {H} are fitted to the inner and outer annulus close to the plenums supplying axial flow. The rings have a number of small through-holes arranged in a radially symmetric pattern, with major axes parallel to those of the annuli. Turbulence is generated by the changes in sectional area as flow passes through the holes, and the pressure drop across them is sufficiently high to ensure uniform flow. The distance between the flow straighteners and the burner exit is a compromise between the need for a long axial length to ensure that turbulence is fully developed, the practical challenges long burner geometries pose for laser diagnostics, and the decay of swirl and turbulence intensity with distance. The development length is over 25 diameters in each annulus, which is sufficient to give well developed turbulent flow at exit for this compact burner geometry. The development length is also short enough to avoid excessive de￾cay of swirl (used in subsequent experiments) before reaching the burner exit. Detailed drawings are available online [20] and the experimental data are available on request.
2.2. Operating conditions
A matrix of operating conditions was created for experiments using the present burner, as shown in Table 1. These conditions were chosen to allow the investigation of flames in premixed and stratified regimes, with or without swirl. Bulk velocities were cho￾sen to maximize the Reynolds numbers in the flows given the physical constraints imposed by the mass flow controllers avail￾able and the maximum throughput of the laboratory air supply. The total power load P varies from 25.8 kW in the premixed cases (split approximately 1:3 between the inner and outer flows), through 21.5 kW in the moderately stratified cases (5:8), to 19.3 kW in the highly stratified cases (11:10). The bulk velocity in the outer annulus, Uo = 18.7 m/s, was set at more than twice the value of the velocity in the inner annulus, Ui = 8.31 m/s, in order to generate substantial levels of shear be￾tween the two flows. Co-flow air was supplied around the outer annulus with a bulk velocity Uco-flow = 0.4 m/s to prevent the entrainment of ambient air. The Reynolds numbers (Re = qUL/l) derived from the bulk velocities and the exit geometry are Rei = 5960 for the inner annulus and Reo = 11,500 for the outer annulus. The stratification ratio, SR, defined as the ratio of the nominal equivalence ratio in the inner annulus to that in the outer, was var￾ied from 1 for premixed cases to 3 for the most stratified cases. The swirl flow ratio, SFR, defined as the ratio of outer annulus flow through the swirl plenum to that through the axial plenum, was varied between 0 for non-swirling flow to 0.4 for very highly swirl￾ing flow. The highly stratified 0.4 swirl flow ratio cases did not stabilize reliably; the high strain at the flame base made the flame
liable to detach and blow off. The SFR = 0.4 cases were not measured during experimental campaigns because of this ten￾dency to blow off. Table 1 also includes the geometric swirl number calculated as the ratio of mean tangential1 velocity to axial velocity, S = Utg/Uz, at the center of the outer annulus. The corresponding flow angles, g, are also tabulated. The value obtained for the higher swirl case (swirl flow ratio of 0.33) indicates that the burner can operate at practically relevant levels of swirl (S P 0.6 [21]). More complete measurements are planned.In the present work results are presented for non-swirling lean cases only: SwB1 (premixed); SwB5 (moderately stratified); and SwB9 (highly stratified). These cases are described as lean because the region of primary interest in the stratified flames is where the mean flame brush, defined as the location of peak temperature fluctuation, crosses the middle of the mixing layer as defined by the location where /g = 0.5(/o + /i) = 0.75. When referring to re￾sults from a case N at a distance of z downstream of the burner exit, the shorthand SwBNz will be used; for example, the premixed lean non-swirling case at z = 30 mm downstream of the burner exit is denoted SwB130.
2.3. Flow control
The gas flows in all experiments were metered using mass flow controllers. In the case of the multi-scalar measurements Section 2.5, the MFCs were calibrated against laminar flow elements to within 1% of reading at the beginning of the measurement campaign. All the controllers used for the velocity characterization were Alicat mass flow controllers, with factory calibration specifying accuracies within ±0.8% of reading and ±0.2% of full scale.
2.4. Velocity characterization
Velocity characterization in the swirl burner was performed using two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (PIV), giving the velocity components in the axial and radial directions. The in￾ner annulus, outer annulus, and co-flow were each seeded with 1 lm calcined aluminum oxide particles. The seeding was adjusted to give similar seed density in each stream. These particles were illuminated using a 7.5 Hz double-pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Litron Nano PIV) operating at 532 nm. The vertical laser sheets had 0.5 mm thickness at the burner centerline. Each pulse was separated by an interval, Dt, of 16 ls. The light scattered by the seed particles was imaged using a CCD camera (LaVision Im￾ager Pro X 4M) fitted with a Nikon AF Micro Nikkor 60 mm lens (f/ 4) and a 50 mm interference filter centered about 532 nm (0.5 nm FWHM). The imaged field was 69.3 mm wide by 69.3 mm tall, with a pixel resolution of 34.1 lm. 
Vectors were calculated using single-pass cross-correlation with a 32  32 window size and 50% overlap. This gives vector field resolution of 0.55 mm. This resolution is too coarse to accurately characterize the thin shear layers near the burner exit, and further PIV measurements are planned. The present PIV measurements re￾veal the main features of the flow field and are essential for inter￾pretation of some features of the scalar results.
2.5. Multi-scalar diagnostics. Multi-scalar laser diagnostics were applied at the Turbulent Combustion Laboratory (Sandia National Laboratories). The diagnostics setup allows for the line measurement of temperature (Rayleigh scattering) and major species (Raman scattering and CO￾LIF) with simultaneous cross planar OH-PLIF. The experimental set￾up is illustrated in Fig. B.3. This setup and the associated methods of data processing have previously been described in [22–25]. Beams from four frequency doubled Nd:YAG lasers were used for Raman and Rayleigh line imaging, yielding a total energy of 1.8 J/pulse in the probe volume. The focus had a diameter of 0.22 mm (1/e2). The beam diameter was 0.24 mm at the ends of the 6 mm length of the measured segment. CO was excited at 230.1 nm (two photons), with the UV laser beam aligned on the same axis as the Nd:YAG laser beams. The line measurement win￾dow is 6.18 mm wide, with a projected binned-pixel spacing of 103 lm, which is larger than the optical resolution of the measure￾ment system. Effective spatial resolution is limited by the beam diameter (depending on flame orientation) and the potential blur￾ring effect of the flame itself (due to variations in the index of refraction relative to the ambient air), which is difficult to quantify. Signal to noise ratios for measurements in the current experiment are detailed in Table 2. The line measurement window was moved radially such that each segment slightly overlapped with the previous one. Three hundred shots were taken for each step in the initial radial scan, and a further 1200 shots were taken at the location were the mean flame brush was found to lie. Substantially larger datasets (5000–30,000 shots) were taken at the intersection of the mean flame brush and the mixing layer using a technique of spatial over￾sampling and wavelet denoising [26], and these data will be the fo￾cus of future work investigating conditional statistics in the flames burveyed. The measurement locations are shown schematically in Fig. B.4. Radial profiles were taken at increments of 10 mm above the burner exit to capture changes in flame structure with axial distance. Simultaneous cross-planar images of OH-PLIF were also taken to allow the determination of the local flame orientation (3D normal vector) and the three-dimensional gradient of the reaction progress variable. Local curvature values were also calcu￾lated from these images. The PLIF investigation windows were 8.06 mm wide by 4.03 mm tall at a projected resolution of 0.048 mm/pixel, centered along the line measurement axis, and oriented at 32 to the vertical. The PLIF sheets were measured to be between 250–300 lm thick (FWHM).
3. Data analysis
A brief synopsis of the data analysis methodologies employed to calculate derived quantities from the experimental measurements is provided for reference.
3.1. Flame front geometry
Flame fronts were extracted from the OH-PLIF images. These images were pre-processed by subtracting an averaged back￾ground frame, correcting for the intensity profile of the laser beam using measurements in products 3 cm above a premixed CH4/air flat flame at near adiabatic conditions, and normalizing between 0 and 1, as in previous studies [9,16,24,27]. A threshold-based methodology was employed to extract sin￾gle-pixel flame fronts from the OH-PLIF images, as in [16]. Flame front tangents at the intersection axis and the angle between the crossed planes were used to extract the three-dimensional flame normal, n, at the line measurement axis [22,23]. The normal was determined by resolving the two-dimensional flame tangents (t1,t2) in each plane from the 2D image coordinate system into the 3D laboratory coordinate system Fig. B.5, and taking their cross product. The normal vector, n, is orientated such that it points from the products into the reactants. The angle h between n and the line measurement axis, x, may be evaluated using the dot product rule. h is used to obtain three-dimensional values of temperature gradi￾ents as described further on. The discrete two-dimensional local curvature, jd, was calcu￾lated using first and second derivatives obtained from third-order polynomial fits to the flame front contours, as in [9]. jd is taken as positive if the flame front is convex towards the reactants.
3.2. Equivalence ratio and mixture fraction
The present work makes use of an equivalence ratio derived from an atomic balance as follows: The equivalence ratio detailed in (1) is the ratio of the demand for oxygen based on the local mass fractions of hydrogen and carbon to the locally available oxygen. This definition of equivalence ratio yields values that are close to those calculated using the scaled Bilger mixture fraction Z [28]:where the subscripts B and s refer to the Bilger definition and the stoi￾chiometric value respectively. Both the equivalence ratio in (1) and the mixture fraction Z (and the derived /B) are conserved from reac￾tants to products across a planar laminar or turbulent premixed flame. However, equivalence ratio and mixture fraction vary within the flame due to effects of differential species diffusion. Furthermore, as reported by Barlow et al. [29], the combination of differential diffusion and bulk transport effects associated with the present bluff-body stabilized burner geometry cause a significant net in￾crease in equivalence ratio across the turbulent flame brush going from reactants to products, especially in the near field of the stabi￾lized flame. Briefly, H2 and H2O diffuse preferentially toward the reactants and are subsequently transported downstream in this highly sheared configuration. Simultaneously, excess CO2 is trapped and accumulated within the recirculation zone. This has implications for the determination of the local gradient of mixture fraction and the conditioning of data on local equivalence ratio, particularly in stratified flames. This issue will be discussed in more detail further on.
3.3. Stratified progress variable
The present work makes use of a thermal progress variable, c(T). In a purely premixed flame this is simply a normalization of the local flame temperature by the maximum temperature at￾tained in the burned products and the temperature of the un￾burned reactants. Errors are introduced if this is applied to a flame in which the equivalence ratio field is varying spatially. Hence, the equilibrium temperature used in the calculation of the thermal progress variable must be allowed to vary with local equivalence ratio:where T(x) is the local temperature, Tu is the temperature in the un￾burned reactants, and Te(/) is the equilibrium flame temperature as
a function of /. This form of thermal progress variable is more suitable than a basic temperature normalization for flames with asignificant degree of stratification.
Progress variables based on reactant mass fraction or other spe￾cies measurements are also feasible, but (3) is preferred due to the superior accuracy and precision of the temperature measurements Table 2 in the present work. It should be noted that (3) results in
values above unity under super-adiabatic conditions. However this is not an issue in the investigated operating conditions.
3.4. Correction of scalar gradients
Differentiation of discrete scalar data using a second order scheme introduces errors in the calculation of gradients which are a function of the experimental resolution, the most notable effect of which is the systematic reduction of peak gradient values. Correc￾tion factors for resolution effects were obtained from high resolu￾tion calculations of laminar flames, and tabulated as a function of / and T for the current experimental resolution, as in [9]. Correction factors obtained may be biased slightly high, as turbulence has been reported to increase flame thickness relative to equivalent laminar cases [30]. The mean magnitude of the correction for peak jrcj in the premixed SwB110 dataset is 6  102 mm 1 , with a maximum correction of 1.1  101 mm 1 (small relative to the peak values of jrcj  1 mm1). The three-dimensional gradient of temperature or progress var￾iable may be obtained from the two-dimensional value along the line measurement axis by dividing these gradients by the cosine of the solid angle h between the flame normal and the line mea￾surement axis as in [22]. The angle-corrected gradient of any scalar w is thus given as dw/dn = (dw/dx)/cosh, h 6 hm. Note that for this correction to be strictly valid, the angle h should be obtained using the same scalar field as the scalar whose gradient is being corrected. It is assumed in the present work that the iso-contours of the OH field will be parallel to those of the tem￾perature field in three-dimensional space. Hence the solid angle h derived from the OH-PLIF measurements can be used to correct temperature or progress variable gradients in the present work. Uncertainties are amplified by the correction as the solid angle increases, imposing limits on the range of angles for which correc￾tions yield sensible results [9,22]. Figure B.6 shows measured values of mean thermal flame thickness dt for the premixed SwB130 case, where dt = (Tmax Tmin)/jrTjmax. The results for the angle correction process show that the mean flame thickness is approximately constant with increasing angle before decreasin apidly for h P 60. A conservative cut-off angle hm = 50 was cho￾sen to minimize the potential for spurious angle-corrected gradi￾ents to influence the results presented, reducing the datasets by approximately 20%. It is possible that some bias is introduced in derived quantities, such as mean flame thickness, by eliminating high-angle realizations.
3.5. Surface density function and scalar dissipation rate
The surface density function, jrcj, and the scalar dissipation rate, vc, are experimentally measurable quantities with great rele￾vance for certain combustion models. The mixture fraction dissipa￾tion rate, vZ, and the cross dissipation rate, vZ,c, are also important quantities, but are not considered further as the mixture fraction gradients are affected by the point to point noise in the mixture fraction data, which is high relative to the temperature data. The scalar dissipation rate for the progress variable is approximated by:where the thermal diffusivity, a, is obtained by interpolating a look￾up table of calculated values in temperature and equivalence ratio. The calculated thermal diffusivity values were taken from un￾strained premixed laminar flame calculations.2
3.6. Error analysis
The uncertainties introduced in the evaluation of the quantities detailed previously are quantified, so as to understand what effects may be due to physical factors, such as flame straining and curva￾ture, and which may be artifacts of the data analysis itself. The pre￾cision of these derived quantities, r, are determined through the application of error propagation in conjunction with the experi￾mental uncertainties listed in Table 2. The equations used are lengthy and so are detailed separately in Appendix A. The resulting uncertainties for the swirl burner data￾sets are listed in Table 3. As data was taken at many heights in the swirl burner, uncertainties are presented at z = 10 mm for the sake of brevity; these values are indicative of the propagated uncertain￾ties at other axial locations.
4. Results and discussion
Presentation and discussion of results are structured as follows. First, the mean and fluctuating velocity fields are shown, along with near-exit profiles. Next, the thermal and compositional evolution of the flames are investigated using radial profiles of Favre-averaged temperature and equivalence ratio at various distances downstream of the burner exit. The influence of stratifi-cation on scalar structure near the intersection of the mixing layer and mean flame brush is considered in detail, including species￾temperature state space, surface density function, and scalar dissi￾pation rate. Finally, turbulent flame thickness and curvature are considered at various downstream distances.
It is important to acknowledge at the beginning of this discus￾sion that it is not possible in this type of complex burner to isolatepremixed and stratified flames in identical flow fields because stratification affects the flow field. Information on the effects of stratification on flame structure may be extracted but not at iden￾tical conditions of shear and turbulence intensity. In the context of comparison with model calculations of these flames the objective should be to demonstrate equivalent accuracy of predictions for both premixed and stratified cases.
4.1. Velocity characterization
Maps of mean and rms velocity are shown in Fig. B.7 for the non-reacting condition and the reacting SwB1, SwB5 and SwB9 conditions (moving from top to bottom). Note that both u0 and U are derived from the same side of the centerline of the experimen￾tal images. Under the assumption of radial symmetry, is shown (mirrored) for r > 0 mm, with white streak lines to high￾light the flow patterns. The assumption of symmetry will be inves￾tigated in the future using full field velocity measurements. The mixing layer and mean flame brush are also plotted to highlight where the flame lies with respect to the flow field. It is worth not￾ing that these do not intersect within the measurement window shown in Fig. B.7. The two-dimensional flow fields, whether reacting or not, are typical of co-annular jet flow with a central bluff body: the peak velocities emerge from the high flow rate annulus, a recirculation zone is formed over the bluff body, and the peak turbulent intensi￾ties coincide with the location of the location of the shear layers.The most significant difference is that the loci of peak U move radi￾ally outwards in the reacting cases due to the expansion of the hot products. This effect is amplified in the stratified cases due to the stratified flames burning through higher equivalence ratios in the inner annulus, which result in hotter products. The values of u0 demonstrate clearly defined shear layers between the recirculation zone, the inner flow, the outer flow, and the co-flow. The breadth and magnitude of these zones indicate that significant turbulent mixing takes place between the streams in all cases. Profiles of Uz and u0 z near the exit of the burner (z = 5 mm) are shown for non-reacting, non-swirling flow in Fig. B.8, correspond￾ing to SwB15, SwB55, and SwB95. Profiles of the radial components of mean and fluctuating velocity are also shown, though these are substantially smaller than the axial components. The exit profiles demonstrate behavior consistent with fully developed channel flow, with peaks in Uz corresponding to flow from the inner and outer annuli. The peak due to the latter is approximately twice that of the inner flow, as expected from the nominal bulk velocities cal￾culated for the annuli. Uz is negative for r < 5 mm, corresponding to the recirculation zone seen in Fig. B.7. The extent and strength of the turbulent shear layers between the inner- and outer-flows and the outer-flow and the co-flow air are shown by u0 z. The measured radial velocity Ur is small in compar￾ison to the axial velocity at z = 5 mm. The radial fluctuations u0 r are similar to their axial counterpart, showing peaks in the shear layers between the inner- and outer-flows and also the outer- and co-flow. Turbulence parameters were calculated near the exit of the bur￾ner (z = 5 mm) at the center of the inner and outer annular gaps using the equations listed in Appendix B from non-reacting measurements. Calculations were also performed at the center of the mixing layer between the annular flows as close to the height at which mean flame brush intersects the mixing layer in reacting flows (z = 50 mm) as the measured data would permit (z = 45 mm). Values of sL and dL from laminar flame calculations at / = 0.75 were used to calculate Da, Ka, and u0 /sL at this location. The values shown in Table 4 indicate that the flames surveyed lie in the thin reaction zone regime on the modified Borghi diagram Fig. B.9. This is cor￾roborated by the absence of broken flame fronts in the OH images.
4.2. Instantaneous flame structure
Instantaneous sample shots of T and / (selected at random) are shown in Fig. B.10, and the corresponding images of OH-PLIF in Fig. B.11 for distances of z = 10 mm and z = 50 mm downstream of the burner exit. The profiles for the premixed case SwB1 are plot￾ted with markers at the experimental resolution (103 lm) to dem￾onstrate the degree to which the diagnostics can probe the
structure of flames within the instantaneous flame brush. The temperature profiles for SwB110, SwB510 and SwB910 resem￾ble error functions, similar to the thermal ramps seen in laminar
flames. The thermal records close to the burner exit show little evi￾dence of turbulence. At this axial location the flames stabilize in the relatively low turbulence region that exists between the inner annulus flow and the recirculation zone Fig. B.7. Additionally, heat release within a shear layer tends to suppress the production of turbulence. Farther downstream shear-generated vortices develop and lead to higher u0 with a wider range of scales, thus the varia￾tion seen in the profiles for z = 50 mm. Records taken farther downstream frequently deviate from these profiles, particularly for the stratified cases, with local peaks and troughs of temperature occurring within the overall thermal ramp, as shown in the top of Fig. B.10 at z = 50 mm. The profiles of equivalence ratio demonstrate an interesting phenomenon at the z = 10 mm location; in all cases the equiva￾lence ratio is suddenly elevated substantially for r < 8 mm, despite the measurement window lying within the rich fuel/oxidizer stream from the inner annulus (no significant mixing with the lea￾ner outer annulus stream has occurred by this downstream loca￾tion). This behavior is examined in detail by Barlow et al. [29] and is attributed to the combined effect of differential species transport and the presence of the recirculation zone, which amplifies the effect of differential diffusion. The behavior observed in the instantaneous profiles is corroborated by the Favre-averaged results presented farther on. Looking farther downstream, at z = 50 mm, the stratified cases demonstrate significant gradients of / within the instantaneous flame front. The OH-PLIF images shown are typical, and demonstrat qualitatively the evolution of the flame topology from relatively smooth near the burner exit (z = 10 mm) to a significantly more con￾voluted state by z = 50 mm. This is shown in a more quantitative fashion by the spread with increasing downstream distance of the probability density functions of curvature shown further on in the present work.
4.3. Favre-averaged structure
Radial profiles of Favre-averaged temperature and equivalence ratio at a range of distances downstream of the burner exit (z = 10, 30, 50, 70 mm) are shown in Fig. B.12. The thermal ramps in eT are almost coincident in the z = 10 mm cases, despite the sub￾stantial differences in / e within the flame brush. The temperature profiles (and thus location of the flame brush) move with stratifi- cation from overlapping the premixed case at z = 10 mm to a substantial separation farther downstream, with the flame for SwB5 stabilizing slightly farther out radially than SwB9. The flame position is a function of the expansion of the hot products and the flame burning rate, which are influenced by the equivalence ratio distribution (and in the case of the burning rate, by the turbulence experienced). The plots of /e show that the central recirculation zone influ￾ences the hydrogen–carbon–oxygen balance significantly (as seen previously in the instantaneous profiles), resulting in elevated equivalence ratio levels in these regions, particularly close to the burner exit. The shear layer between the recirculation zones and the inner annulus flow results in a mixing layer between the ele￾vated and nominal inner annulus equivalence ratios, which gener￾ates non-zero equivalence ratio gradients in the flame brushes for all three cases at z = 10 mm. As noted previously in this paper and examined in detail in [29], the elevated equivalence ratio in the products results from differential species diffusion, the effects of which are amplified by the recirculation zone above the central bluff body. Favre averages and fluctuations of measured scalars at z = 50 mm, are given in Figs. B.13 and B.14. These plots demon￾strate the structural differences in physical space brought about due to stratification of the inlet flows. Data are available in incre￾ments of 10 mm above the burner exit (z = 10, 20,..., 70 mm), but are presented for z = 50 mm as this corresponds to the intersection of the mean flame brush and the mixing layer in the stratified cases (location C in Fig. B.4).
4.4. Extent of stratification
The equivalence ratio in a laminar premixed flame deviates from the nominal value across the thermal ramp of the flame due to the effects of differential diffusion, and similar trends are seen in turbulent premixed and stratified flames. The gradient of equivalence ratio along the line measurement axis therefore exhib￾its large positive and negative values due to differential diffusion, even in premixed cases. It is therefore difficult to isolate gradients in equivalence ratio due to stratification from those due to the dif￾ferential diffusion effect within the instantaneous flame front. An alternative method to quantify the extent of stratification is to consider the change in equivalence ratio, D/, across the thermal ramp in each instantaneous shot. The effect of differential diffusion on equivalence ratio is negligible outside of the thermal ramp and so a sensible measure of the degree of stratification may be ob￾tained. This metric requires the flame to be located such that the entire thermal ramp is contained within the line measurement ，window, resulting in 1–14% of the data being discarded depending on the degree to which the position of the flame front oscillate radially at a given downstream location. Mean and rms values for D/ are listed in Table 5 at the intersection of the mean flame brush and the mixing layer.
The distributions of D/ are shown for various downstream loca￾tions in Fig. B.15. At z = 10 mm the flames are burning through homogenous premixed reactants within the inner annular flow. However, the D/ distributions have non-zero means for all cases. This is due to the elevation of the equivalence ratio in the recircu￾lation zone discussed in the previous section. Interestingly, the moderately stratified distribution has a much lower mean, indicat￾ing that the amplification of differential species diffusion by the recirculation zone mentioned previously is weaker under stoichi￾ometric conditions (/i = 1.0 for SwB5) than in lean (/i = 0.75 for SwB1) or rich (/i = 1.125 for SwB9) conditions. The influence of the recirculation zone on the premixed D/ distributions decreases with increasing axial distance, and the distributions become positively skewed for z > 50 mm due to mix￾ing with the co-flow air. The stratified distributions are similar in width to the premixed distributions near to the burner exit, although the distributions show long tails at z = 30 mm as a fraction of the realizations burn into the mixing layer. The stratified D/ distributions broaden substantially at z = 50 mm relative to the corresponding premixed distribution as the mean stratified flame brushes intersect the mixing layer between the inner and outer ann￾uli flows. The difference between the distributions for SwB5 and SwB9 becomes less pronounced farther downstream (z = 70 mm). This reflects the merging of the two mixing layers and the effect of dilution with co-flowing air on the overall mixing process.
4.5. The thermal evolution of major species
The mean behavior of various species mass fractions can be tracked as a function of local temperature, representative of the ex￾tent of reaction, to identify the influence of stratification on the
flame structure. Figure B.16 provides scatter plots of these species against tem￾perature at z = 50 mm, which marks the intersection of the mixing layer and the mean flame brush for the stratified SwB5 and SwB9 cases, as seen in Section 4.3. The premixed SwB150 case exhibits a degree of mixing with co-flow air; points where the local equiv￾alence ratio was significantly (7.5%) below the mean value at that temperature are not considered in this analysis to ensure the SwB150 dataset can be considered homogeneously premixed. No such conditioning is applied to the corresponding stratified cases. Mean fits and standard deviations are generated by binning the species data in temperature space in steps of 20 K, and the mean values from the premixed SwB150 data are shown by open circles in all plots to facilitate comparisons with the stratified cases. Lam￾inar calculations at the nominal mean equivalence ratio (/ = 0.75) are also shown. Error bars are omitted for clarity as the error of the mean is very small due to the number of points considered within each temperature bin and the already small experimental error percentages Table 2. As such the conditional fluctuation, or stan￾dard deviation, is much more informative in the present work. Note that the experimental data sets are too large to plot all points in a scatter plot; instead 100 points were randomly selected from each temperature bin, and only these are plotted in the scat￾ter plots. In general there is an order of magnitude more points on the reactant and product side than within the thin reaction zone, with the result that a variable percentage of the total data set is shown by these scatter. All data points below the lean flammability limit3 for laminar methane/air flames (/ = 0.47) are plotted in black to highlight any extension of the lean flammability limit by stratifi- cation, as posited elsewhere in the literature on back supported stratified flames [37–39]. The black points are all at temperatures under 1000 K, which suggests that these points have simply been warmed by nearby mixture at higher equivalence ratio that can react fully. Comparing the mean fits in the stratified cases to the mean val￾ues for SwB150 (shown by open circles in the central and right col￾umns), the influence of stratification on the mean thermal evolution of species appears negligible, except for YCO and YH2 at high temperatures. The divergences seen for these species are attributed to the increased mean equivalence ratio in the product regions of the stratified flames. The mean behavior exhibited by the temperature and major species tracks the stoichiometry in all cases.
The calculated mass fractions of CO, O2 and H2O at the nominal equivalence ratio show good agreement with the experimental means in all cases, though the stratified experimental means devi￾ate at high temperatures for due to the increasing equivalence ra￾tio, as noted previously. The agreement is not as good for CO2, which tracks consistently below the experimental averages. The reasons for this are unclear at present, but may also be related to differential diffusion.
4.6. Stratification and scalar gradients
Surface density function, jrcj, thermal scalar dissipation rate, vc, and turbulent flame thickness, dt, all of which are intrinsically dependent on temperature gradients, are considered in this section. These quantities are of particular interest as there is currently little consensus on whether turbulence has a thickening or thinning ef￾fect on flames, which would directly impact both jrcj and vc.
Results from experimental investigations of turbulent flames by O’Young et al. [40] and Chen et al. [41] showed significant thicken￾ing relative to corresponding laminar calculations, and DNS simu￾lations by Sankaran et al. [30] also corroborate this phenomenon. However Soika et al. [42] observed flame thinning in experiments on turbulent flames, and these findings are supported by the numerical simulations performed by Hawkes and Chen [43].
Chakraborty and Klein [44] observed a Lewis number dependence in the behavior of simple-chemistry DNS relative to laminar flame calculations, with peak values of jrcj being lower for Le > 1 (and vice versa). The effects of spatial averaging have been corrected for, as de￾scribed in Section 3, and angle-correction of gradients has been performed to obtain three-dimensional gradients from their pro￾jection on the line measurement axis. Only records where the solid angle between line measurement axis and the three-dimensional flame normal are less than the cut-off angle hc = 50 are considered, as discussed previously in Section 3. Surface density function (top row) and scalar dissipation rate (bottom row) data for the SwB150 (left column), SwB550 (central column) and SwB950 (right column) cases are plotted in progress variable space in Fig. B.17. The format is similar to that used to show the thermal evolution of major species in Fig. B.16, with mean fits and standard deviations of the experimental data ob￾tained by binning in steps of progress variable of 0.05. There is a high degree of scatter in the surface density function data (top) within each bin regardless of the degree of stratification, indicating that the thermal profiles at these locations frequently Appendix B. Turbulence parameters Turbulence parameters were calculated using (B.2)–(B.8). Cant and Mastorakos [46] provide a good explanation of the origin of these equations. The turbulent length scale, Lt, is determined from the autocorrelation coefficient of the instantaneous velocity fluctuations, where the direction of integration dr is in the positive sense of the radial coordinate r used elsewhere in the present work. Note that the kinematic viscosity, m, and laminar flame speed, sL, were calculated using the mean experimental tempera￾ture and equivalence ratio at z = 10 mm as scalar measurements at z = 5 mm are not available.deviate from the ideal error function profile seen in laminar flames.The nature of this deviation is visible in the instantaneous temper￾ature profiles shown in Fig. B.10; local maxima and minima at intermediate temperatures result in a wide range of progress var￾iable gradients at intermediate values of c, leading to the scatter seen in Fig. B.17. The mean surface density function values for the stratified cases are virtually identical to those for the premixed case, and have lower peak values than those from laminar flame calculation.
These results are in agreement with those in [30,40,41], which demonstrated attenuated progress variable gradients on the mean relative to corresponding laminar values. Furthermore, the pdfs of jrcj at c = 0.5 exhibit similar behavior to those in [30], with broad distributions skewed towards lower jrcj values. These results may also be indicative of preferential diffusion of heat relative to mass (Le > 1), as attenuation was observed under such conditions in [44]. The scalar dissipation rate (bottom row) also shows similar mean behavior whether premixed or stratified, albeit with margin￾ally higher peak values for the stratified cases. This is attributed to the thermal diffusivity, which is strongly coupled with equivalence ratio, which is higher on the mean for the stratified cases than for SwB150. The mean surface density function and scalar dissipation rate are significantly lower than the laminar flame calculations at the nominal equivalence ratio; this is assumed to be due to the local peaks and troughs in the temperature (and by extension, progress variable) profiles mentioned previously. jrcj values will vary from high to near-zero values in the vicinity of a local peak or trough, which occur at intermediate values of progress variable. This reduces the mean value of jrcj, leading to the attenuation rel￾ative to calculations seen in Fig. B.17. Figure B.18 shows the probability density functions of flame thickness, defined as [Tb  Tu]/jrTjmax, at various axial distances downstream of the burner exit (z = 10, 30, 50, 70 mm) for the SwB1,SwB5 and SwB9 cases. The distributions for SwB1,SwB5 and SwB9 behave as expected based on the Favre-averaged tempera￾ture profiles seen in Fig. B.12. An inherent drawback to this definition of flame thickness is that it only gives a sensible measure of the thickness of the thermal ramp in cases that resemble a steep error function. As noted previ￾ously, local maxima and minima are common within the instantaneous profiles of temperature in the current burner (see Fig. B.10); these features are not captured by the expression used for the flame thickness, with the result that the thicknesses reported are not necessarily indicative of the physical structure of the flame. As such caution is advised in the interpretation of these results. A more sensible metric may be to determine flame thickness from the physical distance spanned between the start and end of the flame brush in records where the entire flame front has been imaged. However the metric used to generate Fig. B.18 is common in the literature and so is used here for ease of comparison.
4.7. Influence of stratification on curvature
Stratification has been found to broaden the curvature probabil￾ity density function (pdf) relative to that for an equivalent pre￾mixed case in a variety of burner configurations, including freely expanding flame kernels [10] and weakly turbulent V-flames [9,13,16]. However, DNS results from Malkeson et al. [45] in statis￾tically planar flames at levels of u0 /sL between the V-flame cases and the present work have shown no influence of stratification on curvature (under the assumption of a direct negative correlation between curvature and the tangential diffusion component of dis￾placement speed). Curvature distributions from the present burner are plotted in Fig. B.19 for various axial distances downstream of the burner exit, showing the evolution of flame topology for SwB1, SwB5, and SwB9. Data are presented for heights of z = 10, 30, 50, 70 mm only, but similar trends are exhibited for all z locations surveyed. The pdfs are virtually unchanged by the addition of stratification at all heights, in marked contrast to the results seen for weakly turbulent flame configurations. This suggests that the influence of stratifica￾tion on curvature is strongly coupled to the local turbulence parameters, accounting for the contrast with the results for V-flames in weak turbulence [9,10,13,16]. Stratification is expected to have some effect on flame topology due to variation in local flame speed. The implication of the present results is that this effect diminishes as turbulent intensity in￾creases. Despite the moderate turbulence levels (u0/SL) in the pres￾ent experiments there are no significant difference in curvature pdfs between the premixed and stratified cases. This uggests that the effect of stratification on curvature at the higher turbulence levels seen in practical combustion applications may be minimal within the range of stratification considered here.
5. Conclusions 
A double annular, bluff-body burner was developed in order to systematically investigate effects of fuel–air stratification on flame structure in a turbulent flow field having features relevant to prac￾tical combustion applications. Velocity and scalar results were presented for three non-swirling cases, homogeneously premixed (/i = /o = 0.75), moderately stratified (/i = 1.0,/o = 0.5), and highly stratified (/i = 1.125,/o = 0.375), each operated at the same inlet flow rates. Axial and radial flow fields were revealed using two dimensional PIV, while the thermo-chemical structure was probed within the flame front using Rayleigh/Raman/CO-LIF line measure￾ments with simultaneous cross-planar OH-PLIF. The main conclu￾sions are as follows: (i) The flames surveyed fall within the thin reaction zone regime on the modified Borghi diagram. (ii) Significant levels of stratification are achieved within the flame front. For example, the mean change in / across the thermal ramp in the highly stratified SwB950 case is D/ ¼ 0:17 at the intersection of the mean flame brush and the mixing layer. (iii) Favre averaged results reveal elevated equivalence ratio levels within the recirculation zone for the premixed case. This is attributed to the combined effects of preferential transport of hydrogen away from the flame front near to the burner exit and the accumulation of CO2 within the recirculation zone, which increases the calculated equiva￾lence ratio based on the main species. (iv) The mean behavior of H2O, O2 and CH4 at the intersection of the mixing layer with the mean flame brush is well captured in temperature space by unstrained laminar flame calcula￾tions at the nominal equivalence ratio. Significant differ￾ences are seen in H2, CO, and to a lesser extent CO2 relative to calculations. (v) The mean thermal evolution of all species surveyed is independent of stratification for much of temperature space (T < 1700 K) at z = 50 mm (the intersection of the mean flame brush and mixing layer for the stratified cases). Large deviations are seen for CO and H2 above this temperature, and are attributed to higher mean equivalence ratio in stratified cases near the products. Surface density function and scalar dissipation rate show negligible stratification dependence at these locations, and are significantly attenu￾ated relative to corresponding laminar unstrained values due to the effects of local peaks and troughs within the instantaneous thermal ramp. (vi) Curvature in the current burner shows no stratification dependence at any surveyed height downstream of the burner exit, indicating that the changes with downstream distance exhibited by the pdfs of curvature are dominated by the turbulence field. This is likely to hold at higher turbu￾lence intensities characteristic of practical combustion systems. Future work will address the effects of swirl on flame structure and will further examine the region of intersec ion of the stratified mixing layer and the mean flame brush by multiply conditioning larger datasets.

Turbulence parameters were calculated using (B.2)–(B.8). Cant and Mastorakos [46] provide a good explanation of the origin of these equations. The turbulent length scale, Lt, is determined from the autocorrelation coefficient of the instantaneous velocity fluctuations, where the direction of integration dr is in the positive sense of the radial coordinate r used elsewhere in the present work. Note that the kinematic viscosity, m, and laminar flamespeed, sL, were calculated using the mean experimental tempera￾ture and equivalence ratio at z = 10 mm as scalar measurementsat z = 5 mm are not available.
where I is the turbulence intensity, Lt is the turbulent length scale, gK is the Kolmogorov length scale, mK is the Kolmogorov velocity scale, sK is the Kolmogorov time scale, and all other symbols have their usual meanings.










The three-dimensional structure of swirl-switching in bent pipe fow 

Swirl-switching is a low-frequency oscillatory phenomenon which a ects the Dean vor-tices in bent pipes and may cause fatigue in piping systems. Despite thirty years worth of research, the mechanism that causes these oscillations and the frequencies that characterise them remain unclear. Here we show that a three-dimensional wave-like structure is responsible for the low-frequency switching of the dominant Dean vortex. The present study, performed via direct numerical simulation, focuses on the turbulent fow through a 90. pipe bend preceded and followed by straight pipe segments. A pipe with curvature 0.3 (defned as ratio between pipe radius and bend radius) is studied for a bulk Reynolds number Re = 11 700, corresponding to a friction Reynolds number Re. ¡Ö 360. Synthetic turbulence is generated at the infow section and used instead of the classical recycling method in order to avoid the interference between recycling and swirl-switching frequencies. The fow feld is analysed by three-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) which for the frst time allows the identifcation of the source of swirl-switching: a wave-like structure that originates in the pipe bend. Contrary to some previous studies, the fow in the upstream pipe does not show any direct infuence on the swirl-switching modes. Our analysis further shows that a three-dimensional characterisation of the modes is crucial to understand the mechanism, and that reconstructions based on 2D POD modes are incomplete.

1. Introduction 
Bent pipes are an essential component of a large number of industrial machines and processes. They are ideal for increasing mass and momentum transfer, passively mixing di erent fuids, which makes them e ective as heat exchangers, inverters, and other appliances. For a review of the applications of bent pipes in industry see Vashisth et al. (2008); the most recent advances in experiments and simulations can be found in the review by Kalpakli Vester et al. (2016). The high mass and momentum transfer is generated by the secondary motion caused by the centrifugal force acting on the fuid in the curved sections. This secondary motion, which is of Prandtl¡¯s frst kind, takes the shape of two counter-rotating vortices, illustrated in fgure 1, which move the fuid 
. Email address for correspondence: jcanton@mech.kth.se 
towards the outside of the bend, along the centreline, and back towards the inside along the wall, therefore increasing the mass and momentum transfer across the pipe section. 
These vortices were frst observed by Boussinesq (1868) and Eustice (1910), and later described analytically by Dean (1928) from whom they received the name of Dean vortices. The intensity of these vortices increases with Reynolds number, here based on pipe diameter and bulk velocity (i.e., Re = DUb/¦Í, where ¦Í is the kinematic viscosity of the fuid), as well as with pipe curvature, defned as the ratio between pipe radius and bend radius, ¦Ä = R/Rc (see Canton et al. 2017 for laminar fow; Noorani et al. 2013, the review by Kalpakli Vester et al. 2016, and references therein, for turbulent fows). 
For laminar, steady fow the Dean vortices are symmetric with respect to the bend symmetry plane (the I-O plane in fgure 1); but when the fow becomes unstable the vortices start oscillating periodically (K¡§uhnen et al. 2014, 2015; Canton et al. 2016). These large-scale oscillations are caused by the appearance of periodic travelling waves which, as also observed in other fows (see, e.g. Hof et al. 2004), are at the base of transition to turbulence for toroidal and helical pipes. 
A di erent kind of large-scale oscillations is observed for high Reynolds numbers: here the turbulent fow is modulated by a low-frequency alternation of the dominant Dean vortex. This vortex alternation excites the pipe structure and is presumed to be the cause of structural, low-frequency oscillations observed in heat exchangers (e.g. in microgravity conditions such as in a test for the international space station; Br¡§ucker 1998), as well as the origin of secondary motion in the bends of the cooling system of nuclear reactors (Kalpakli Vester et al. 2016). The Dean vortex alternation was initially, and unexpectedly, observed by Tunstall & Harvey (1968), who experimentally studied the turbulent fow through a sharp, L-shaped bend (¦Ä = 1). These authors measured ¡°low random-frequency¡± switches between two distinct states and, by means of fow visualisations, were able to identify an either clockwise or anti-clockwise predominance of the swirling fow following the bent section. The switching was found to have a Strouhal number St = f D/Ub highly dependent on Re and comprised between 2 ¡Á 10.4 and 
4.5 ¡Á 10.3 . Tunstall & Harvey attributed the origin of the switching to the presence of a separation bubble in the bend and to the ¡°occasional existence of turbulent circulation entering the bend¡±. 
To the best of our knowledge, the frst author to continue the work by Tunstall & Harvey (1968) was Br¡§ucker (1998), who analysed the phenomenon via particle image velocimetry (PIV) and coined the term ¡°swirl-switching¡±. Br¡§ucker studied a smoothly curved pipe with ¦Ä =0.5 and identifed the oscillations as a continuous transition between two mirror-symmetric states with one Dean cell larger than the other. He confrmed that the switching takes place only when the fow is turbulent, and he reported two distinct peaks, St =0.03 and 0.12, at frequencies considerably higher than those measured by Tunstall and Harvey, despite the lower Reynolds numbers considered. 
R¡§utten et al. (2001, 2005) were the frst to numerically study swirl-switching by performing large-eddy simulations (LES) for ¦Ä =0.167 and 0.5. The main result of this analysis is that the switching takes place even without fow separation; moreover, R¡§utten and co-workers found that the structure of the switching is more complex than just the alternation between two distinct symmetric states, since the outer stagnation point ¡°can be found at any angular position within ¡À40.¡±. R¡§utten et al. found a high-frequency peak at St ¡Ö 0.2, attributed to a shear-layer instability, and, only for their high Reynolds number case, one low-frequency peak for St ¡Ö 5.5¡Á 10.3 , which was connected to the swirl-switching. However, the simulations for R¡§utten et al.¡¯s work were performed by using a ¡°recycling¡± method, where the results from a straight pipe simulation were used as infow condition for the bent pipe. These periodic straight pipes were of length

L =3.5D and 5D and likely infuenced the frequencies measured in the bent pipes since the periodicity of the straight pipes introduced a forcing for St = Ub/L =1/3.5 and 1/5, respectively. 
Sakakibara et al. (2010) were the frst to analyse the fow by means of two-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (2D POD) performed on snapshots extracted from stereo PIV. Their results for ¦Ä =0.75 reveal anti-symmetric structures that span the entire pipe cross-section and contain most of the energy of the fow. A spectral analysis of the corresponding time coe.cients shows peaks between St ¡Ö 0.07 at so =2D and St ¡Ö 0.02 for so = 25D, in the range found by Br¡§ucker (1998). In a subsequent work Sakakibara & Machida (2012) conjectured that the swirl-switching is caused by very large-scale motions (VLSM) formed in the straight pipe preceding the bend. 
¡§ 
Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013) and Kalpakli & Orl¡§u (2013) also presented results based on 2D POD. The former performed experiments for ¦Ä =0.5 and found non-symmetric modes resembling a tilted variant of the Dean vortices with St =0.16 and 0.33, corresponding 
¡§ 
to the shear-layer instabilities found by R¡§utten et al. (2005). Kalpakli & Orl¡§u (2013), on the other hand, studied a pipe with ¦Ä =0.31; di erently from previous works, the section of straight pipe following the bend was only 0.67 diameters long. Their results at the exit of this short segment show clearly antisymmetric modes as most dominant structures. The swirl-switching frequency obtained from the POD time coe.cients was St =0.04; peaks of St =0.12 and 0.18 were also measured but were found not to be related to swirl-switching. In a later work Kalpakli Vester et al. (2015) repeated the experiments for ¦Ä =0.39 and found again a dominant frequency corresponding to St =0.04. 
¡§ 
Carlsson et al. (2015) performed LES in a geometry similar to that of Kalpakli & Orl¡§u (2013), namely, with a short straight section following the bend, for four di erent curvatures. The infow boundary condition was generated by means of a recycling method,

as in R¡§utten et al. (2001, 2005), with a straight pipe of length 7D, exciting the fow in the bent pipe at St =1/7. The three lower curvatures were therefore dominated by the spurious frequencies artifcially created in the straight pipe by the recycling method, while the frequencies measured for ¦Ä = 1, corresponding to 0.5 < St < 0.6, were in the same range identifed by Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013) but were found to be mesh dependent. 
Noorani & Schlatter (2016) were the frst to investigate the swirl-switching by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS). By using a toroidal pipe they showed that swirl-switching is not caused by structures coming from the straight pipe preceding the bend, but is a phenomenon inherent to the curved section. Two curvatures were investigated, ¦Ä =0.1 and 0.3, and both presented a pair of antisymmetric Dean vortices as the most energetic POD mode with St =0.01 and 0.087. 
Table 1 summarises the main results of the aforementioned studies. It is clear from this literature review that there is a strong disagreement among previous works not only on what is the mechanism that leads to swirl-switching, but also on what is the frequency that characterises this phenomenon. In the present work an answer to both questions will be given, which will also explain the discrepancies between previous studies. 
The paper continues with a description of the numerical methods employed for the analysis, presented in ¡ì2, devoting special attention to the infow boundary conditions. The results of the simulations and POD analysis are presented in ¡ì3 and are discussed and compared with the literature in ¡ì4. 
2. Analysis methods 
2.1. Numerical discretisation The present analysis is performed via DNS of the incompressible Navier¨CStokes equations. The equations are discretised with the spectral-element code Nek5000 (Fischer et al. 2008) using a PN . PN.2 formulation. After an initial mesh-dependency study, the polynomial order was set to N = 8 for the velocity and, consequently, N =6 for the pressure. We consider a 90. bent pipe with curvature ¦Ä =0.3 for a Reynolds number Re = 11 700, corresponding to a friction Reynolds number Re. ¡Ö 360 (referred to the straight pipe sections). A straight pipe of length Li =7D precedes the bent section (see ¡ì3.1), and a second straight segment of length Lo = 15D follows it. Further 
details about the mesh, including element number and size, are reported in table 2. The supplementary video movie1.m4v shows the setup and a visualization of the fow.

Quantities indicated as (¡¤)+ are reported in viscous scaling, and the numbers between parenthesis correspond to minimum and maximum values. 
2.2. Infow boundary and divergence-free synthetic eddy method Since the aim of the present work is to reproduce and study swirl-switching, a periodic or quasi-periodic phenomenon, the treatment of the infow boundary is of utmost impor-tance. The fow feld prescribed at the infow boundary should not introduce any artifcial frequency, in order to avoid the excitation of unphysical phenomena or a modifcation of the frequencies inherent to the swirl-switching. A recycling method, as the one used by R¡§utten et al. (2001, 2005) and Carlsson et al. (2015), should therefore be avoided, as highlighted in ¡ì1. In the present work the velocity feld at the inlet boundary of the straight pipe preceding the bend is prescribed via a divergence-free synthetic eddy method (DFSEM). This method, introduced by Poletto et al. (2011) and based on the original work by Jarrin et al. (2006), works by prescribing a mean fow modulated in time by fuctuations in the vorticity feld. The superposition of the two reproduces up to second order the mean turbulent fuctuations of a reference fow and requires a short streamwise adjustment length to fully reproduce all quantities. The fuctuations are provided by a large number of randomly distributed ¡°vorticity spheres¡± (or ¡°eddies¡±) which are generated and advected with the bulk velocity in a fctitious cylindrical container located around the infow section. When a sphere exits the container, a new, randomly located sphere is created to substitute it. The cylindrical container is dimensioned such that newly created eddies do not touch the inlet plane upon their creation and they have stopped a ecting it before exiting the container, i.e., the cylinder extends from . max(Deddies) to max(Deddies) (see fgure 5 in Poletto et al. 2013, for an illustration of the container). The random numbers required to create the fuctuations are generated on a single pro-cessor with a pseudo random number generator (Chandler & Northrop 2003) featuring an algorithmic period of 21376 iterations, large enough to exclude any periodicity in the simulations, which feature approximately 10 000 synthetic eddies. The size of the spheres is selected to match the local integral turbulence length scale, and their intensity is scaled to recover the reference turbulent kinetic energy, producing isotropic but heterogeneous second-order moments. The method prescribes isotropic turbulence, instead of the correct anisotropic variant, because it was shown that the former leads to a shorter adjustment length in wall-bounded fows (see fgure 11 in Jarrin et al. 2006). In order to satisfy the continuity equation, no synthetic turbulence is created below (R . r)+ < 10; however, this does not signifcantly a ect the adjustment length since the dynamics of the viscous sublayer are faster than the mean and converge to a fully developed state in a shorter distance. The turbulence statistics necessary for the method, specifcally the mean fow U (r), the turbulent kinetic energy k(r), and the dissipation rate .(r), were extracted from the straight pipe DNS performed by El Khoury et al. (2013). Section 3.1 presents the 
validation of our implementation of the DFSEM; more details can be found in Hufnagel (2016). 
2.3. Proper orthogonal decomposition 
Besides point measures, we use POD (Lumley 1967) to extract coherent structures from the DNS fow felds and identify the mechanism responsible for swirl-switching. More specifcally, we use snapshot POD (Sirovich 1987) where n three-dimensional, full-domain fow felds of dimension d (corresponding to the number of velocity unknowns) are stored as snapshots. POD decomposes the fow in a set of orthogonal spatial modes i(x) and corresponding time coe.cients ai(t) ranked by kinetic energy content, in decreasing order. The most energetic structure extracted by POD corresponds to the mean fow and will be herein named ¡°zeroth mode¡±, while the term ¡°frst mode¡± will be reserved for the frst time-dependent structure. 
A series of instantaneous fow felds (snapshots) is ordered column-wise in a matrix S ¡Ê Rd¡Án and decomposed as: 
d 
X 
S = UV . = iai, (2.1) i=1 
where U ¡Ê Rd¡Ád ,  = diag(¦Ò1,¦Ò2, ¡¤¡¤¡¤ ,¦Òm, 0), with m = min(d, n), and V ¡Ê Rn¡Án . The decomposition in (2.1) is obtained by computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of M1/2ST 1/2 , where M is the mass matrix and T is the temporal weights matrix, which 
. .. 
results in . VU and . are unitary matrices ( . U. V .= I); the U . , where . VU = I and . V 
M.1/2 . .1/2 .
POD modes are then obtained as U = U and V = TV . To improve the convergence of the decomposition, we exploit the symmetry of the pipe about the I . O plane, which results into a statistical symmetry for the fow, and store an additional mirror image for each snapshot (Berkooz et al. 1993). 
3. Results and analysis 
3.1. Infow validation An auxiliary simulation for Re. = 360 was set up to test the performance of the DFSEM in a 25D long straight pipe, provided with the same mesh characteristics used for the bent pipes. Classical statistical quantities were used for the validation and compared with the reference values by El Khoury et al. (2013). The comparison is presented in fgure 2(a) as a function of distance from the infow boundary, and shows that the DFSEM approaches a fully developed turbulent state (within ¡À1% of error) at approximately 5D from the infow boundary. Figures 2(b-d) present the velocity, stress profles, and the turbulent kinetic energy budget at the chosen streamwise position of si =5D, which confrm the recovery of fully developed turbulence by the divergence-free synthetic eddy method. A length of 7D was therefore chosen for the straight pipe preceding the bent section, in order to allow for some tolerance and to account for the (weak, up to 1D) upstream infuence of the Dean vortices (Anwer et al. 1989; Sudo et al. 1998). For comparison, the more commonly used approach where random noise is prescribed at the infow requires a development length between 50 and 110D (Doherty et al. 2007). POD modes were also computed to further check the correctness of this method. The results, not reported here for conciseness, were in good agreement with those presented by Carlsson et al. 
(2015) for a periodic straight pipe, that is, streamwise invariant modes with azimuthal wavenumbers between 3 and 7.

Solid lines indicate the reference data, while symbols represent the current results (note that the number of shown points is reduced and does therefore not represent the grid resolution; see table 2). 
3.2. Two-dimensional POD 
Two-dimensional POD, considering all three velocity components, is employed as a frst step in the analysis of swirl-switching. Instantaneous velocity felds are saved at a distance of 2D from the end of the bent section and are used, with their mirror images, to assemble the snapshot matrices (Berkooz et al. 1993). 1 234 velocity felds were saved at a sampling frequency of St =0.25, and the sampling was started only after the solution had reached a statistically steady state. As a consequence of exploiting the mirror symmetry, all modes are either symmetric or antisymmetric, a condition to which they would converge provided that a su.cient number of snapshots had been saved. 
The frst three modes are shown in fgure 3 by means of pseudocolors of their streamwise velocity component and streamlines of the in-plane velocity components. Two out of three modes are antisymmetric: (i, ii) and are in the form of a single swirl covering the whole

pipe section, (i), and a double swirl, (ii), formed by two counter-rotating vortices disposed along the inner-outer direction on the symmetry plane. The third mode, (iii), resembles a harmonic of the Dean vortices. 
These fndings are in agreement with previous experimental work, such as that of ¡§ 
Sakakibara et al. (2010) and Kalpakli & Orl¡§u (2013), which attributed the dynamics of swirl-switching to the antisymmetric modes. The frequency content of these modes is presented in fgure 4, in terms of Welch¡¯s power spectral density estimate for the time coe.cients of the frst three modes, corresponding to the structures shown in fgure 3. It can be observed that the spectra have a low peak-to-noise ratio and that each mode is characterised by a di erent spectrum and peak frequency, in agreement with previous 2D POD studies: see, e.g., fgure 8 in Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013), which presents peaks with similar values to the present ones, although their study was for a slightly larger curvature of ¦Ä =0.5. This fact has caused some confusion in the past, with disagreeing authors attributing di erent causes to the various peaks, without being able to come to the same conclusion about the frequency, nor the structure, of swirl-switching. The reason is that swirl-switching is caused by a three-dimensional wave-like structure, as will be shown by 3D POD in ¡ì3.3, and a two-dimensional cross-fow analysis cannot distinguish between the spatial and temporal amplitude modulations created by the passage of the wave. A simple analytical demonstration of this concept is provided in the Appendix, and shows that conclusions drawn from a fow reconstruction based on 2D POD modes (see, e.g., Hellstr¡§om et al. 2013) are incomplete. 

3.3. Three-dimensional POD For the 3D POD, the same snapshots as for 2D POD were used. In order to reduce memory requirements, the snapshots were interpolated on a coarser mesh before com-puting the POD. This is, however, not a problem because the swirl-switching is related to large-scale fuctuations in the fow. The four most energetic modes are depicted in fgure 5 by means of pseudocolors of nor-mal and streamwise velocity components, as well as streamlines of the in-plane velocity. It can be observed that the modes come in pairs: 1-2 and 3-4, as is usual for POD modes and their time coe.cients in a convective fow. The frst coherent structure extracted by the POD is formed by modes 1 and 2 and constitutes a damped wave-like structure that is convected by the mean fow (see fgure 5 for the spatial structure and fgure 6 for the corresponding time coe.cients; the supplementary video movie2 modes0-2.mov shows their behaviour in time). This is not a travelling wave such as those observed in transitional fows, as the ones of the examples mentioned in the introduction, but a coherent structure extracted by POD from a developed turbulent background that persists in fully developed turbulence, and is just a regular component of the fow on which irregular turbulent fuctuations are superimposed (see, e.g., Manhart & Wengle 1993, for a similar case). Nevertheless, the present wave-like structure could be a surviving remnant of pre-existing, purely time-periodic, fow structures formed in the bent section and arising in the process of transition to turbulence past bends (see, e.g., the case of the fow past a circular cylinder by Sipp & Lebedev 2007). It was found that the frst instability of the fow inside of a toroidal pipe is characterised by the appearance of travelling waves (K¡§uhnen et al. 2014; Canton et al. 2016). It is therefore possible that similar waves appear in the transition to turbulence of the present fow case, and continue to modulate the large scales of the fow at high Reynolds numbers while being submerged in small-scale turbulence. To support this hypothesis, the frequencies and wavelengths of the present coherent structures are in the same range as those measured in toroidal pipes (Canton et al. 2016), and Br¡§ucker (1998) observed swirl-switching even for Re as low as 2 000, although the measured oscillations had very low amplitude. The present modes are, obviously, not strictly periodic in space nor in time: as can be seen in fgure 5(b) showing the swirl intensity, the intensity of the modes is essentially zero upstream of the bend (s< 0), reaches a maximum at about 1D downstream of the bend end, and then decreases with the distance from the bend. Furthermore, the respective time coe.cients are only quasiperiodic, as can be observed from their temporal signal, depicted in fgure 6(a), and by their frequency spectra, fgure 7(a). Nevertheless, it can be observed in fgure 5 that the spatial structure of these modes is qualitatively sinusoidal along the streamwise direction so, with a wavelength of about 7 pipe diameters. The fgures in Br¡§ucker (1998) actually already suggest the appearance of a wave-like structure in the presence of swirl-switching. This wave-like structure is formed by two counter-rotating swirls, visible in the 2D cross-sections in fgure 5, which are advected in the streamwise direction while decaying in intensity and, at the same time, move from the inside of the bend towards the outside, as can be seen in the longitudinal cuts in fgure 5 and in the supplementary video movie2 modes0-2.mov. The temporal amplitude of these modes is also qualitatively cyclic, as illustrated by the projection along the time coe.cients in fgure 6(b). The 
wave-like behaviour can be appreciated even better in the aforementioned video showing the fow reconstructed with these two modes, movie2 modes0-2.mov. Modes 1 and 2 are

Figure 7. Welch¡¯s power spectral density estimate for the time coe.cients ai of the most energetic 3D POD modes. The frequencies are scaled with pipe diameter and bulk velocity. The markers and corresponding labels report the frequency corresponding to the peak of each spectrum. The range of the Strouhal number is identical to that of fgure 4 to ease comparison. 
phase-shifted by a quarter of their quasi-period: fgure 5 shows that the structure of mode 2 is located approximately a quarter of a wavelength further downstream of the structure of mode 1; while, fgure 6 illustrates the constant delay of the time coe.cient of mode 2 with respect to that of mode 1. 
The second structure, formed by modes 3 and 4, has a spatial layout that closely resembles that of the frst pair, i.e., it is also a wave-like structure, and constitutes the frst ¡°harmonic¡± of the wave formed by modes 1 and 2. The spatial structure of modes 3 and 4 has half of the main wavelength of modes 1 and 2, and the highest peak in the spectrum of the third and fourth time coe.cients is at exactly twice the frequency of the peaks of a1 and a2, as can be seen in fgure 7(a). The video movie3 
modes0-4.mov shows the reconstruction of the fow feld by including modes 3 and 4. It can be observed that these modes introduce oscillations with higher frequency and smaller amplitude when compared to the reconstruction employing only modes 1 and 2. 
As can be observed from fgure 5, the modes do not present any connection to the straight pipe section preceding the bend. This is in direct contrast with the fndings of Carlsson et al. (2015), whose results were likely altered by the interference of an intrinsic frequency and wavelength on the recycling infow boundary with the structure of the swirl-switching. Our results are, instead, in agreement with Noorani & Schlatter (2016) who observed swirl-switching in a toroidal pipe (i.e., in the absence of a straight upstream section) confrming that these large-scale oscillations are not caused by structures formed in the straight pipe, but by an e ect which is intrinsic to the bent section. 
The power spectral density analysis of the time coe.cients of these modes, computed as a Welch¡¯s estimate, is presented in fgure 7. One can see that, unlike the PSD of the two-dimensional POD modes (fgure 4), the three-dimensional modes present two distinct peaks, one per pair of modes. The peak for the frst modal pair is located at St ¡Ö 0.16, which is in the range of Strouhal numbers found by both Br¡§ucker (1998) and Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013). More importantly, this frequency is the lowest for this pair of modes and matches that given by the wavelength and propagation speed of the wave as well as that of the swirl-switching, as observed by reconstructing the fow feld with the most energetic POD modes (see the online movies). 
The present analyses were also performed on a pipe with curvature ¦Ä =0.1 for the same Reynolds number. Swirl-switching was observed in this case as well, with dynamics which is qualitatively identical to the one observed for ¦Ä =0.3, but is characterised by lower frequencies, peaking at St ¡Ö 0.045. The lower frequencies and larger scales (wavelength of about 20D) characterising the wave-like structure at this curvature meant that a quantitative analysis was too expensive with the present setup. We have therefore limited this work to the study of one curvature only, but preliminary, not converged results can be found in Hufnagel (2016). 
4. Summary and conclusions 
This work presents the frst DNS analysis of swirl-switching in a 90. bent pipe. The simulations were performed by using a synthetic eddy method to generate high-quality infow conditions, in an e ort to avoid any interference between the incoming fow and the dynamics of the fow in the bent section, as was observed in previous studies. Three-dimensional POD was used to isolate the dominant structures of the fow. This method allowed the identifcation of a wave-like structure, originating in the bent section, constituted by the frst modal pair. A reconstruction of the fow feld using the most energetic modal pair confrmed that the swirl-switching is caused by this structure. 
The swirl-switching frequency found in the present study is in the range of those deduced by Br¡§ucker (1998) and Hellstr¡§om et al. (2013). The structure of the modes, which presents no connection to the upstream straight pipe, confrms what was conjectured by Noorani & Schlatter (2016), who observed swirl-switching in a toroidal pipe, namely that swirl-switching is a phenomenon intrinsic to the bent pipe section. 
Clearly, the present fndings are in contrast with previous conclusions drawn from fow reconstructions based on 2D POD modes and Taylor¡¯s frozen turbulence hypothesis (see, e.g., Hellstr¡§om et al. 2013): the 2D analysis mixes convection and true temporal variation, and thus cannot reveal the full three-dimensional structure of travelling modes. This does not only apply to the present fow case, but to any streamwise inhomogeneous fow in which 2D POD is utilised in the cross-fow direction. 
The wave-like structure found in the present study is di erent from those observed in transitional fows (see, e.g. Hof et al. 2004), in the sense that it is simply a coherent structure extracted by POD from a turbulent background fow, as opposed to an exact coherent state. Nevertheless, we conjecture that this structure may be a surviving remnant of a global instability caused by the bend (K¡§uhnen et al. 2014; Canton et al. 2016).

Appendix. Considerations on the use of 2D POD 
This section explains, analytically, the reasons why a two-dimensional cross-fow POD analysis is an ine ective tool for understanding swirl-switching. In order to capture the essence of the phenomenon, the example is without spatial dissipation and noise, but these can be added at will without changing the discussion or the results. A Matlab script performing the operations described in this section is provided as part of the supplementary online material. 
Consider a sine wave of period 2¦Ðl, travelling at speed v, and with amplitude modulated at a frequency ¦Ø/(2¦Ð): 
 
x . vt 
g(x, t)=sin cos(¦Øt) . (A 1) 
l When measuring its passage at a given spatial position, say g(xm,t), the recorded time signal will contain two frequencies, f1 =(¦Ø . v/l)/(2¦Ð) and f2 =(¦Ø + v/l)/(2¦Ð), that combine the spatial component, fs = v/(2¦Ðl), and the temporal component, ft = ¦Ø/(2¦Ð). This combination is a result of the fact that g can be rewritten, using one prosthaphaeresis formula, separating the time and space dependencies: 
hi hi
1 xv 1 xv 
g(x, t)=sin + ¦Ø . t + sin . ¦Ø + t. (A 2) 
2 ll 2 ll The two components, fs and ft, would be measured in isolation if the function g were a pure travelling wave (¦Ø = 0) or a pure standing wave (v = 0). However, when both aspects are present (¦Ø =6 0 and v =6 0) a complete knowledge of g is necessary in order to separate fs from ft. This, clearly, is possible in the present example, where the analytical expression of g(x, t) is known. When studying an unknown phenomenon (such as swirl-switching) the knowledge of f1 and f2 is insu.cient: one does not know what is causing the measured frequencies: it could be two travelling waves advected at di erent speeds (or provided with di erent period); two standing waves modulated at di erent frequencies; or, as in this case, one travelling wave with modulated amplitude. This problem can transferred to a POD analysis as well: the 2D POD in the pipe corresponds to a zero-dimensional POD in this example, which employs the measurements g(xm,ti) as snapshots, while the 3D POD of the bent pipe fow corresponds to a one-dimensional POD which uses the function g(x, ti) over the whole x domain as snapshots. The 0D POD returns a single mode which assumes a value of either +1 or .1 and does not provide any information about the spatial structure of g. The spectrum of the time coe.cient corresponding to this single mode contains both frequencies f1 and f2. When using 0D POD one does not have any information about the spatial nature of g, and is lead to believe that the oscillations measured in xm are caused by two periodic phenomena with frequencies f1 and f2. This likely is what has caused so much disagreement in the literature about the value of the Strouhal number related to the swirl-switching and on the 2D POD mode responsible for this phenomenon. The answer is that none of the 2D POD modes reported in the literature is actually the swirl-switching mode, and the Strouhal numbers extracted from time coe.cients do not provide a correct description. A 1D POD analysis of the function g, which is the analogue of the 3D POD in the 
bent pipe, provides the correct answers. It results in two sinusoidal modes which, with the corresponding time coe.cients, reproduce the complete travelling and oscillatory behaviour of g. The spectra of the time coe.cients still contain only f1 and f2, but have a much higher peak to noise ratio compared to the 0D POD, as observed in the bent pipe by comparing fgures 4 and 7. Moreover, by analysing the reconstruction of g, they allow the separation of fs from ft. 
It is now clear why in the case of a streamwise-dependent spatial structure, such as the one creating swirl-switching (as shown in ¡ì3.3), only a fully three-dimensional analysis can correctly identify the actual spatial and temporal components.

Title:Turbulent Flows in Curved Pipes: Recent Advances in Experiments and Simulations 
Abstract: Curved pipes are essential components of nearly all the industrial process equipments, ranging from power production, chemical and food industries, heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, or exhaust gas ducts of engines. During the last two decades, an interest on tur-bulent .ows in such conduits has revived, probably due to their connection to technical applications such as cooling systems of nuclear reactors (e.g., safety issues due to .ow-induced fatigue) and reciprocating engines (e.g., ef.ciency optimization through exhaust gas treatment in pulsatile turbulent .ows). The present review paper, therefore, is an account on the state-of-the-art research concerning turbulent .ow in curved pipes, natu-rally covering mostly experimental work, while also analytical and numerical works are reviewed. This paper starts with a historical review on pipe .ows in general and speci.-cally on .ows through curved conduits. In particular, research dealing with the effect of curvature on transition to turbulence, work dealing with pressure losses in curved pipes, as well as turbulence statistics are summarized. The swirl-switching phenomenon, a spe-ci.c structural phenomenon occurring in turbulent curved pipe .ows, which has interest-ing fundamental as well as practical implications, is reviewed. Additional complications, with respect to .ow through bends, namely, entering swirling .ow and pulsating .ow, are reviewed as well. This review closes with a summary on the main literature body as well as an outlook on future work that should be performed in order to tackle open questions remaining in the .eld. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4034135] 
1 Introduction 
Pipe .ows are the most common way to transport liquids and gases in technical and industrial processes. This is the case for transportation of oil and gas in pipelines and hot (cold) water for district heating (cooling), in all the types of process industry (such as pulp and paper industry, chemical plants, and nuclear power plants), for hydropower stations, etc. Also, for internal combus-tion engines, the so-called gas-exchange system is an intricate and compact system of piping where for a turbocharged vehicle, air is moved to and from the compressor to the cylinders through a pipe system and exhaust gases evacuated to a turbine and then through an after-treatment system and .nally to the exhaust. Also, biologi-cal systems rely on transportation of gases and liquids in ¡°pipelike¡± veins, arteries, and capillaries, such as the respiratory and cardiovascular systems in mammals. In all the aforemen-tioned cases, some parts of the piping system are curved due to the necessity to adopt to the geometrical or technical constraints of the system or to redirect the .ow. 
The .ow in pipes may be laminar, transitional, or turbulent depending on the geometrical, .uid, and .ow parameters of the system. The .ow itself can be steady or pulsatile, the latter is the case for the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, as well as, for instance, in engine .ows. For gas .ows through pipes, one may need to consider compressibility as well. Pipes themselves can have many different cross sections: round, oval, square, rectangu-lar, etc., the pipe wall can be rigid or .exible, smooth or rough, and there may be branches or junctions. In any pipe system, one would also expect to .nd bends of various angles and sharpness. Curved pipes or pipe bends are commonly associated with strong secondary .ow and increased pressure losses that are due to an instability set up by the centrifugal forces acting on the .uid as it passes through the bend. Also, cross-sectional mixing and heat

transfer may be strongly affected if a .uid passes through a curved pipe. 
As can be seen from the descriptions above, the .ow through pipes incorporates a vast area of various conditions. In this review, we will concentrate on aspects of turbulent .ows through curved pipes. There exist several reviews, book chapters, and books examining the effect of streamline curvature in general (see, for example, the extensive work by Bradshaw [1]) as well as speci.-cally within the area of pipe bends spanning from 1938 to 2008 [2¨C11], however, there exists quite substantial work done on tur-bulent .ows in curved pipes, which is not suf.ciently covered in the available literature. In the most well-cited2 
and extensive review on curved 
pipes 
[6], the authors state that ¡°laminar incom-pressible .ows will be our primary concern¡± and there is only a short section at the end of the review referring to some work on turbulent .ow as well as experimental work. However, especially in the last two decades, a number of studies exploiting advanced optical experimental techniques as well as (large-eddy/direct) numerical simulations (LES/DNS) have been conducted for the study of turbulent .ow characteristics in different bend con.gura-tions. In the present review, we will therefore focus on presenting state-of-the-art research related to turbulent .ow through pipe bends based on experiments and simulations and also give a his-torical background on original experimental and analytical studies relevant to the .eld. 

1.1 Some Basic Definitions 
Before proceeding, it is useful to give the de.nitions of a few basic parameters that are used when referring to the different stud-ies. The types of pipes, which will be discussed throughout the paper and are commonly used for numerical/experimental investi-gations in the main literature body, are the ones shown in Fig. 1 
along with their main geometrical parameters.

Fig. 1 Different pipe con.gurations: (a) straight pipe, (b) 90 deg bend, (c) helix, and (d) torus, showing how some param-eters are de.ned. L, pipe length; D 5 2R, pipe diameter; Rc, cur-vature radius; c, coil radius; and 2pb, coil pitch. The torsion of a coil is de.ned as s 5 b=ec21b2T. 
We de.ne the Reynolds number as 
Re .qWbD=l (1) 
where q is the .uid density, D .2R is the pipe diameter (R being the pipe radius), Wb is the bulk velocity, and l is the dynamic viscosity. 
For curved pipe .ows, the so-called Dean number is often used, which takes into account both the Reynolds number and the effects of curvature. It was .rst introduced for laminar .ow and small curvatures by Dean [12,13], as will be discussed later on. This parameter took various forms in different studies through the years [14¨C16], sometimes based on the constant pressure gradient (mostly in theoretical/numerical studies) and sometimes on the mean velocity in the pipe (mostly in experimental studies) causing some confusion in the interpretation of the results from the litera-ture (see a discussion on this matter in Ref. [6]). Here, we de.ne the Dean number based on the curvature ratio c .R=Rc and the Reynolds number (based on the bulk velocity) as 
p...
De .cRe (2) 
The curvature radius, Rc, is here de.ned as the distance from the center of curvature to the centerline of the pipe, see Fig. 1 
The curvature ratio is within the limits 0 c 1, where for a straight pipe c .0 and for a sharp bend it is equal to 1 (sometimes sharp bends are referred to as elbows, typically when c is close to 1). 
Note that even though the Dean number is sometimes used in the literature for turbulent .ow (see, for example, Refs. [17] and [18]), c and Re should be viewed as independent parameters for (not only) turbulent .ows [19]. While in laminar .ow, the Dean number characterizes the integral quantities (for a detailed study on this matter, the interested reader is referred to Ref. [20]), the situation is, in particular, different for turbulent .ows where at least three different length scales play a role (pipe radius, curva-ture radius, and the turbulent viscous length scale). 
In this review, when referring to papers where the authors have used a different de.nition of the Reynolds and/or Dean numbers (for instance, using the radius as the length scale or de.ned the curvature ratio differently), we have recalculated them to adhere to the present de.nition.3 
It should also be noted that the notation 
3We have also rounded of numbers given to two signi.cant digits whenever needed.

introduced here will be used throughout this review, unless other-wise stated such as when reprinting published .gures from the lit-erature. Finally, if not otherwise stated, we present results using the Cartesian coordinate system with z being the streamwise, x the horizontal, and y the vertical directions (as de.ned in Fig. 2) cor-responding to W, U, and V velocity components, respectively. Capital letters denote time-averaged quantities, small letters denote instantaneous quantities, whereas primed small letters denote r.m.s. quantities. 
Another important nondimensional parameter is the Fanning friction factor (f) de.ned as 
R dp
f .(3) 
qW2ds
b 
where dp=ds is the pressure gradient along the pipe. The Fanning friction factor is a way to nondimensionalize the pressure loss in a pipe of constant diameter, whereas the behavior of the curve in the f¨CRe diagram has traditionally been used to identify whether the .ow is laminar, transitional, or turbulent. 
Other parameters that will be useful to describe certain phe-nomena or .ow cases will be introduced in conjunction with their discussion. 
1.2 Outline. We start with a historical review on pipe .ows in general and speci.cally on .ows through curved conduits in Sec. 2. For curved .ows, we are here mainly referring to studies of laminar .ow. In Sec. 3, mainly experimental research dealing with the effect of curvature on transition to turbulence is reviewed although recently some DNS studies have been performed that give new insights.

reviews both work dealing with pres-sure losses in curved pipes as well as turbulence statistics (mean velocity and Reynolds stresses), divided into sections with results obtained from experiments (Sec. 4.2.1), turbulence modeling (Secs. 4.2.2 
and 4.2.3), and DNS (Sec. 4.2.4). In Sec. 4.3, a spe-ci.c structural phenomenon is reviewed, namely, the so-called swirl switching which has interesting fundamental as well as prac-tical implications. Thereafter, we describe two additional compli-cations with respect to .ow through bends, namely, entering swirling .ow (Sec. 5) and pulsating .ow (Sec. 6). Finally, in Sec. 7, the main conclusions from the reviewed literature as well as suggested future work to be performed for turbulent curved pipe .ows are summarized. 
2 Historical Review 
Although pipes (or conduits) have been used to transport water at least since the construction of the .rst aqueducts in the Roman empire during the 4th century BC, the .rst scienti.c studies of pipe .ows are usually referred to around 1840 when Hagen [21] and Poiseuille [22] carried out experimental work on water .ow through straight pipes of various sizes to deter-mine the pressure losses, now known as Hagen¨CPoiseuille pipe .ow. Hagen observed that above a certain pressure head, the .ow became unstable, what he observed was probably the tran-sition to turbulence. 

Darcy [23], who was a hydraulic engineer, among others responsible for building the water supply system for Dijon 
[24], did similar studies. He investigated pressure drop in pipes of large dimensions (with a diameter of up to 0.5 m and more than 100 m long) where the .ow was certainly turbulent. He also studied the effect of roughness of the pipe walls on the pressure drop. 
Of course, a review on pipe .ows cannot exclude the pioneer-ing work on laminar¨Cturbulent transition by Reynolds in the late 19th century which was also published in his famous paper [25], where he de.ned the nondimensional number that we today know as the Reynolds number (Eq. (1)). Reynolds showed that transition to turbulence could not occur below a certain value, today known as the critical (or sometimes transition) Reynolds number. 
The .rst scienti.c notion of .ow through curved pipes of circu-lar and rectangular cross section is often attributed to the theoreti-cal work by Boussinesq [26]. His analysis showed that for laminar .ow through a curved channel of rectangular cross section, two symmetrical vortices exist. However, in some reviews, the work by Thomson in 1876 [27,28] is cited as the earliest effort to study .ows in curved pipes. Thomson4 
studied the windings of rivers and compared it with the .ow in pipe bends, however, he noted that a river (or curved channel) with a free upper surface in some respects is different from that of a .ow in a closed, .lled conduit. Thomson illustrated the secondary .ow set up in a river bend in a small laboratory model where he let particles show the inward motion at the bottom of the bend. His explanation of the particle motion was that pressure and centrifugal force set up by the curva-ture balance in the bulk .ow make an imbalance in the slow mov-ing .uid near the bottom and thus leads to an inward secondary .ow there. Nevertheless, even though usually neglected in histori-cal reviews on curved pipe .ows, the .rst work¡ªto the best of our knowledge¡ªdealing with .ow in curved pipes was the one by Weisbach in 1855 [30], who performed experiments to determine the pressure drop in sharp bends. 
Experiments in a curved pipe were also performed a bit later by Williams et al. [31] showing for the .rst time that the maximum mean velocity is shifted toward the outer wall at the outlet of a bend. Eustice [32,33] performed experiments, published around 1910, on .ow in various curved pipes and showed that the pres-sure drop increases as compared to a straight pipe but that the change of pressure drop observed in straight pipes at transition to turbulence was not as abrupt. The experiments by Eustice were followed by those of White [16], who clearly showed through pressure drop measurements that curvature stabilizes the .ow and that the transitional Reynolds number can be substantially increased for a curved pipe, compared to that of a straight one. 
Probably the most well-known name in curved-pipe-.ow research, Dean5 
(for a portrait see Fig. 3(a))6 
investigated analyti-cally the laminar .ow in a circular, curved pipe [12,13]by 
4James Thomson (1822¨C1892) was the 2 yr older brother of William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, and was a hydraulic engineer, who became professor in Civil Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Glasgow and was elected as an FRS in 1877. A biography including his scienti.c writings can be found in Ref. [29], which can be accessed through the web for free. 
5William Reginald Dean (1896¨C1973) entered Trinity College at the University of Cambridge in 1919 and was elected a fellow of Trinity College 4 yr later. For some years, he was at the Imperial College London, where his .rst work on .ow in curved pipes and channels [12,13,34] was carried out in the late 1920s. In 1929, he moved back to Cambridge and stayed in Cambridge until 1952 when he was elected to the Goldsmid Chair of Mathematics at the University College of London from which he retired in 1964 [35]. Among other achievements, Dean was a co-winner of one of the most prestigious awards at the Cambridge University, the Adams Prize in 1950, along with G. K. Batchelor and L. Howarth, for their essays on the subject of ¡°Problems in the mechanics of solids and .uids (including elasticity, plasticity, and hydrodynamics).¡± The committee who awarded the Prize consisted of H. Jeffreys, S. Goldstein, and G. I. Taylor [36]. His last paper on curved pipe .ow was written in 1959 [37]. Generally, Dean has been described as a man ¡°with a well-developed gift of silence¡± and there is not so much information about his life and career apart from one paragraph and a portrait in the paper by Binnie [38].

assuming that the cross-.ow velocity disturbance was much smaller than the streamwise velocity and that c was small. He showed that the important parameter was Re2c (the square root of this is nowadays known as the Dean number, see Sec. 1.1) but also that a cross-.ow velocity .eld was established for small cur-vature ratios. In Ref. [12], the cross .ow pattern, if projected on the cross-stream plane, was identi.ed to consist of two counter-rotating vortex cells, where the .ow in the center plane was directed toward the outer wall. These vortices are today called Dean cells or Dean vortices in honor of Dean¡¯s work, see Fig. 3(b).7,8 
A .uid particle in such a .ow would move downstream along a helical path and this analytical result con.rmed the .ow visualization picture obtained by Eustice, although the variation of the pitch of the helix with velocity seemed to be opposite that of the experiments. However, his expansion allowed only small values of the Dean number or rather that Re2c=1440 <1tobe

8The term Dean vortices are originally referred to the small amplitude laminar .ow pattern shown in Fig. 3(b), however, similar vortices that exist in turbulent .ows are also denoted as Dean vortices.

considered. Since the expansion was only taken to .rst order this resulted in that the pressure drop along the pipe became independ-ent of the pipe curvature. In his follow-up study [13], Dean increased the expansion to higher orders and showed that an increase in curvature gives rise to a lowering of the .ow rate at a given pressure drop and again he found that the governing param-eter was the Dean number (squared). 
Dean continued his work on curved .ows by studying the curved two-dimensional channel [34]. In contrast to the .ow in a circular pipe, he found that the mean .ow in a two-dimensional channel could be without secondary .ows if the value of De was small enough (here, the pipe diameter is replaced by the distance between the channel walls). However, he found that the .ow became unstable to streamwise oriented vortices if Re2c >36. This work was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A, and the reviewer was no less than Taylor (see the referee report in Fig. 4). Curved channel .ow has been studied both through experiments and numerical simulations, speci.cally with regards to instabilities in the .ow (see, e.g., Refs. [39] and [40]), however, for curved pipes, there was no linear stability analysis available until recently with the work by Canton et al. [19]. 
Reviewing Dean¡¯s paper together with the concurrent work by White [16] may have inspired Taylor [15] to perform his own study of .ow in curved pipes.9 
He used .ow visualization by

injecting dye to determine the .ow structure in a glass helix and showed that the transition to turbulence was delayed to larger Reynolds numbers with increased curvature ratio. 
Flows in curved geometries caught the interest of many (famous) scientists, among them also Albert Einstein [43], who discussed .ows related to meandering of rivers. In his paper, he illustrated the centrifugal effect by the well-known tea-leaf obser-vation, i.e., that tea-leaves in a cup, if stirred into rotating motion, end up in the central part of the bottom due to the secondary motion set up by a centrifugal imbalance in the boundary layer at the bottom (see Fig. 5). 
Adler [44] in 1934 made measurements in curved pipes, all with a diameter of 1 cm, but with different small curvature ratios (c .0:005;0:01;and 0:02). The .ow medium was water, and a Pitot tube was used to measure velocity pro.les along seven dif-ferent chords on one side of the pipe (including the symmetry line of the pipe). The measurements were done for both laminar and turbulent conditions. From these measurements, he was also able to construct contour plots of the streamwise velocity. The contour plots all show the crest-shaped form that we associate with a sym-metric vortex pair. A year later, Wattendorf [45] measured mean velocities and pressure of fully developed turbulent .ow in a curved channel between two concentric circular walls. 
Since the two early pioneering papers by Dean [12,13], many other combined analytical and numerical studies have presented the laminar .ow in curved pipes from the 1960s on, see, e.g., Refs. [14] and [46¨C48]. Smith [49], for instance, looked at how the .ow upstream the bend was affected and showed that there was .ow toward the side of the inner wall of the bend creating a maximum of the shear there. Dennis and Ng [50] showed that for high Dean numbers, a four-vortex cell pattern was possible in addition to that of two vortices, whereas Dennis and Riley [51] looked at asymptotic solutions for high Dean numbers. In all these studies, the Dean number was found to be the governing parame-ter, however, we will not go into the details here since today they may be seen as obsolete as laminar .ow solutions of the Navier¨CStokes equations can now easily be obtained numerically through other methods without any severe assumptions. 
3 Transition to Turbulence 
The transition from laminar to turbulent .ow in curved pipes is a subject that has been investigated to a limited extent so far. Most of the existing studies regard helical pipes, whereas the main conclusions until a few years ago were based on pressure drop data, in which case the onset of turbulence was identi.ed by a change in the slope of the Fanning friction factor¨CReynolds number diagram. However, only a few studies give insight into how the transition is occurring. 
Early studies indicated that the transition to turbulence in a curved pipe appears at a lower Reynolds number when compared to a straight pipe. However, Dean [13] explained in his .rst ana-lytical work that the increase in resistance in a curved pipe hap-pens due to the secondary .ow, whereas Eustice [32] remarked that there is no critical Reynolds number for coiled pipes. Since the experimental studies by Taylor [15] and White [16] in helical

pipes and by Adler [44] in curved pipes, it was made clear though that the onset of turbulence in curved pipes happens at a higher Reynolds number than in straight pipes, which is demonstrated in Fig. 6 
(taken from the work by Taylor [15] on transition to turbu-lence in coiled pipes). 
In fact, White [16] showed that for Reynolds numbers between 102 <Re <6 103, the resistance of a curved pipe (c .0:02) becomes progressively higher than for a straight pipe as Re increases and at Re .6 103, the .ow resistance was 2.9 times higher for the curved pipe. Similarly, Taylor [15] introduced dye through a small hole in a helical glass pipe and observed through .ow visualizations that a steady streamline motion persisted for a Reynolds number which was 2.8 times higher than the critical Reynolds number for straight pipes. These observations are sum-marized in Berger et al. [6] stating that the critical Reynolds num-ber for a curved tube might be larger by a factor of two or more compared to the one for a straight pipe (which is typically equal to Re .2 103). Moreover, as described in Ref. [4], it was anticipated from an early stage, that contrary to straight-pipe .ow, the critical condition in a curved pipe with small curvature depends on the disturbance level of the .ow, whereas for c >0:01 there is a unique critical Dean number for a given curvature ratio. 
An empirical relation for the critical Reynolds number was given by Ito [52], who compiled the critical Reynolds number given by earlier studies [15,16,44,53] together with his own data. The relation predicts a critical Reynolds number Recr .2:3 103 for c .0:001. Srinivasan et al. [54] also proposed relations for the critical Reynolds number for helices and spirals, which were later adapted by Ward-Smith and can be found in his book [4]. 
One of the most well-cited studies on transition in curved pipes is the one by Sreenivasan and Strykowski [55], who by means of .ow visualizations showed that the turbulent .ow entering from a straight into a coiled pipe becomes laminar and returns to its tur-bulent state after exiting the coil (see Fig. 7), see also Refs. [56] and [57]. The authors also observed that the .ow becomes time-periodic just before the onset of turbulence. The same observa-tions of relaminarization of the .ow in curved pipes were made later by Kurokawa et al. [58], who studied the laminarization of low Reynolds number turbulent .ow in curved and helically coiled pipes by means of smoke visualizations and velocity by means of hot-.lm anemometry measurements. The authors con-.rmed that the secondary .ow has a stabilizing effect delaying the transition to turbulence and observed similar to Ref. [55] that tur-bulent .ow in the upstream straight section becomes laminar as it

passes through the coil. Sreenivasan and Strykowski are often given credit for being the .rst to make an effort to explain why the .ow in the coil is more stable than in a straight pipe. They showed that the upper critical Reynolds number (highest Re up to which the .ow remains laminar) measured at the end of 20 coils for 0 c 0:12 increases monotonically with c, however, the lower critical Reynolds number (the lowest Re at which the .ow is fully turbulent) reaches a maximum value and then suddenly drops. They also remarked that the .ow in the downstream straight section from the coil remains laminar for higher Re com-pared to the upstream straight pipe section. In another important study, Webster and Humphrey [59] found by means of laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements that periodic low-frequency perturbation waves arose at a Reynolds number Re .5 103 for a helical coil and c .0:054; a result that was later con.rmed 
by 
numerical 
simulations 
and 
.ow 
visualizations 
[60]. 
Today, it is generally known that the transition process from laminar to turbulent .ow in a curved pipe occurs more gradually as compared to a straight pipe (where the transition is known to happen abruptly in most cases). Recent DNS and experimental studies in helical and toroidal pipes have shown more speci.cally that the transition process can include many stages. The .rst study aiming to study the instability of the .ow is the one by Di Piazza and Ciofalo [61], who performed DNS in a torus for c .0:1 and 
0.3. The authors found that for c .0:1, there is a direct transition from steady to quasi-periodic .ow with symmetrical traveling waves perturbing the .ow, whereas for c .0:3 the transition starts with a Hopf bifurcation (supercritical transition) affecting mainly the Dean vortices and for higher Reynolds number (Re >5270), a secondary Hopf bifurcation appears leading to a quasi-periodic .ow. Therefore, the .ow is changing from station-ary to periodic, quasi-periodic, and .nally a chaotic state accord-ing to the authors, albeit their DNS were later found to be inaccurate [19,62]. For small curvatures, there is a subcritical tran-sition like the one occurring in a straight pipe, whereas for higher curvature values, a multistage supercritical transition occurs as described in Refs. [19] and [62] and will be discussed in more detail later on. In short, as summarized by K€
uhnen [63], the key features of the transition in curved pipes are the following: the curvature has a stabilizing effect, the transition happens gradually as opposed to a straight pipe, stable traveling waves arise in the transitional .ow, and turbulent .ow from a straight pipe can be fully or partially relaminarized by passage through a curved (heli-cal) pipe. K€
uhnen et al. [64] are the only ones to have performed experiments (SPIV, LDV) in toroidal pipes by using a steel sphere to drive the .ow to study the transition process. 
Cioncolini and Santini [65] provided a criterion for the critical Reynolds number as well. For curvature ratios below 0.042, they observed that before turbulence sets in, the f¨CRe curve depicted a

local minimum followed by an in.ection point and thereafter a local maximum. K€
uhnen et al. [62] performed LDV experiments both in toroidal and helical pipes with small pitch in order to detect disturbances in the .ow as the curvature ratio increased from 0.01 to 0.1 and found good agreement with the previous studies by Ito [52], Kubair and Varrier [66], and Cioncolini and Santini [65], who determined the critical Reynolds number from pressure drop data. From the critical Reynolds number¨Ccurvature ratio pairs, they could see a common trend of the critical Reynolds number to increase with increasing curvature ratio, although some scatter between the different studies is observed. Noorani and Schlatter [67] showed that close to Re .3:4 103 in a torus for c .0:01, a marginally turbulent .ow is established in which the friction drag reduces below the laminar solution for a straight pipe at the same Reynolds number, so-called sublaminar friction drag (see also Sec. 4.1). The most recent study on the matter which provided also the .rst instability analysis in a torus is the one by Canton et al. [19], where linear stability analysis and DNS were performed for various Re c. For the .rst time, the full range of curvatures (arriving to the upper limit of 1) was investigated 
(0:01 c 1). The authors con.rmed the results by K€
uhnen et al. [62] that the .rst instability occurring in a torus is a Hopf bifurcation (supercritical instability) as well as showed that previ-ous works indicated subcritical transition for curvature ratios below 0.02¨C0.04, see also Fig. 8. The authors found .ve families of eigenmodes (a family of eigenmodes shares similar characteris-tics) for different Re c pairs, see also Fig. 9; family F1A for high curvature and low Reynolds numbers which leads to a modi-.cation of the base .ow, a family of symmetric modes, F2S for medium curvature (0:54 c <0:64), a third family responsible for the onset of instability for 0:16 <c <0:48, and a fourth fam-ily (F4S) causing the instability for 0:016 <c <0:16. Finally, a family of antisymmetric modes was also detected for values of c below 0.0016. As it can be seen, previous studies agree on the existence of subcritical transition for very low curvatures (below 0.04), whereas the eigenmode family F4S was identi.ed in both Refs. [55] and [62].

.ows, the pressure losses in curved pipes are higher than for straight pipes. This increase is due to centrifugal forces, which in turn (can) cause the .ow to separate at the inner wall of the curved pipe. The empirical relations put forward by Weisbach to express the increased pressure losses quantitatively for both elbow and curved pipes remained for half a century a reference as high-lighted in Ref. [68]. The increased pressure drop could through the .ow visualization studies by Eustice [32] later be coupled to the appearance of the secondary .ow. Since then, there has been a great interest to determine the pressure loss coef.cient used to compute pressure losses from the presence of pipe bends [69]. For example, investigators such as Nippert [70] and Richter [71] (among many others, see, e.g., Refs. [72] and [73]) performed tests on curved pipes to determine the pressure loss as function of various .ow and geometrical parameters, whereas Wasielewski 
[74] investigated the pressure losses in the bend of circular cross section as a function of the bend angle. 
As explained in the introductory part of the paper by Barua [75], a radial pressure gradient in the curved pipe is required to balance the centrifugal force applied from the curvature. Nowa-days, it is well-known that in a pipeline containing a bend, there will be a pressure increase along the outer bend wall and a decrease along the inner bend, and that this difference persists for

quite some distance downstream the bend leading into loss of pressure at downstream stations. This is depicted clearly in Fig. 10, which is reprinted from one of the pioneering studies on pres-sure losses in bends performed by Ito [76]. This study, together with an earlier one by the same author 
[52] on friction factor rela-tions for a wide range of curvature radii and Reynolds numbers, constitutes benchmark work which has been praised by other authors (e.g., see Ref. [77]), whereas the formulas they provided have been validated in recent studies [61,65]. In the .rst work by Ito [52], several experiments were conducted in order to establish a correlation between the friction factor and the .ow rate, which is one of the most crucial aspects of internal pipe .ow from an engineering point of view. The author compared his results with previous works [16,44,53]. As remarked by Ito, earlier published formulas for the bend-loss coef.cient provided results with con-siderable disagreement with more recent experiments 
[30,71,78]. The reason for the failure of previous studies was attributed later by 
Ward-Smith 
[4] to that the entry/exit conditions were not care-fully controlled, and the de.nition of the pressure drop was not precise. For a list of early relations of the bend-loss coef.cient as well as their performance, the reader is therefore referred to the work by 
Ito 
[76]. The in.uence of the degree of curvature, curva-ture ratio, Reynolds number, as well as recovery length of the downstream straight pipe section on the total pressure-loss coef.-cient has been investigated by various authors, and the results up to the early 1980s are summarized in a book chapter in Ref. [4]. In an earlier work, Ward-Smith [79] even showed that for the same Reynolds number range, turning angle, and curvature ratio, the same formulas for the pressure-loss coef.cient apply for square-and circular-cross-sectioned pipe bends without any con-siderable differences in the results. 
More recent work on pressure drop is mainly done in helically coiled pipes, such as the one by 
Ali 
[80], where an extensive table (Table 1 
therein) was given with many of the pressure drop corre-lations available in the literature. A similar effort to gather all the friction factor correlations for turbulent .ow in curved pipes was done a bit later also by Vashisth et al. [10] (Table 8 therein). As apparent from the aforementioned references, most of the work done on pressure drop in curved pipes/coiled tubes considers

laminar .ow and either helical or toroidal coils. Turbulent .ow has been generally neglected in the literature when considering the determination of the friction law in curved pipes with only a few exceptions [16,52,53]. Recently, Ref. [81] studied the effect of increasing Reynolds number on the Fanning friction factor for a constant curvature ratio, c .0:01, and they surprisingly showed that under some conditions, the friction factor is not higher for the curved pipe as compared to a straight one, as commonly believed. In fact, both substraight and sublaminar (friction) drag could be observed in some recent studies [65,67]. The most recent friction factor correlations are summarized together with the ones by Ito 
[52] in Fig. 11, reprinted from Ref. [67]. 
4.2 Turbulence Statistics and Flow Structures. In the fol-lowing sections (Secs. 4.2.1¨C4.2.4), experimental and numerical work which have been performed on turbulent .ows in curved pipes of different types (but of circular cross section) are pre-sented and discussed. Figure 12 
illustrates some common bend shapes that have been used in the literature, apart from the ones already shown in Fig. 1. 
4.2.1 Experiments. Between the early 1970s and late 1990s, the main literature body on mean quantities (velocity and pressure) and turbulence statistics along bends (mainly 90 deg or U-bends, which are typical in practical applications) was created. Measure-ment techniques employed mainly include LDV and hot-wire ane-mometry, whereas wall shear gauges, pressure taps, and Pitot tubes have also been used. Turbulence models have also been uti-lized almost at the same time as the experiments, mainly the most common ones (standard k e or k x) but even more sophisti-cated ones, as it will be outlined in detail in Secs. 4.2.2¨C4.2.3. 
One of the .rst studies that provided turbulence statistics of a curved pipe .ow through experiments was the one by Adler [44], showing mean velocity pro.les and contours for Reynolds

numbers range Re .2 12 103. Weske [82] presented velocity distributions from hot-wire measurements in various bends of cir-cular, square, and elliptical cross sections where in most of them separation occurred at the inner bend wall. Detra [83] presented mean axial velocity contours for high Reynolds numbers up to approximately Re .2:5 106 for different bends (a 21 deg bend with c .0:02 and a 42 deg bend with c .0:04). 
Since those early works, a number of studies on turbulence sta-tistics in pipe-bend .ows have been conducted, and the main results that were commonly found by different studies include the fact that the mean streamwise velocity becomes higher at the inner wall at 30 deg angle (see Fig. 13 
for clari.cation of the angle posi-tion along the bend) and at which point the Dean vortices start to form [84¨C87]. The mean .ow has been seen deviating from the fully developed turbulent pro.le at upstream distances of approxi-mately 1D [87,88]. At 90 deg, the maximum of the velocity was found to have shifted toward the outer wall and remains so down-stream the bend. On the other hand, the r.m.s. of the axial velocity is higher at the inner wall and lower at the outer wall (see, for example, Fig. 14). With increasing distances from the bend, the mean velocity pro.le becomes more uniform and the strength of the secondary .ow decreases. However, a distance of more than 50D is sometimes required for the .ow to return to its fully developed state, even for small curvatures [87¨C89]. It should be noted that the mean velocity, turbulence intensity, and Reynolds stresses were found to be similar for both 90 deg and 180 deg bends up to a bend angle of 60 deg [84]. Thereafter, it is shown that the effect of curvature on the .ow is stronger for a 180 deg bend, and a longer recovery length is required. Some of the most signi.cant experimental works which have been conducted on tur-bulence statistics in curved pipe .ows are summarized in Table 1. These will be described in more detail in the following paragraphs. 

Total pressure (Pt) measurements by means of Pitot tube as well as yaw angles by means of Conrad probes/claw-type yawmeters were made by Rowe [90], along a 180 deg bend for Re .2:4 105 and c .0:042. The .ow at the inlet was a fully developed turbulent pipe .ow, and it was shown that the second-ary motion becomes strongest 30 deg from the bend inlet, whereas for larger angles, it reduced in strength until it reached a constant value at 90 deg, i.e., the .ow pattern remained unchanged after that angle until the bend exit and it was therefore found to have reached a fully developed state. The author also detected second-ary .ow reversal along the bend symmetry plane between 90 deg and the 5D downstream station. The total pressure contours did not even recover from the effects of the curvature at a distance of 61D downstream the bend. 
Some measurements were also made in 45 deg S-bends, which, as the author remarks, give increased heat transfer compared to other bends. Compared to a 180 deg bend, the fully developed state was reached faster downstream of the S-bend. In fact, almost fully developed pipe .ow was achieved at approximately 50D shorter distance for the S-bend. However, this work showed con-.icting results with Ref. [88] and has been criticized by later stud-ies [86] due to the in.uence of the probes intruding the .ow and measurement uncertainties. 
Later on, Enayet et al. [85] performed LDV measurements in laminar and developing turbulent .ows (Re .4:3 104) at dif-ferent angles and up to 6D downstream a 90 deg bend (c .0:17). The mean streamwise velocity pro.les between the laminar and turbulent .ow cases were compared, whereas for the turbulent .ow case the corresponding turbulence intensity as well as static-pressure variation was presented. It was shown that a negative streamwise pressure gradient at the bend inlet exists on the inner wall which is twice the positive gradient existing on the outer wall. Those gradients disappear at an angle of approximately 25 deg and for bend angles up to 75 deg, a uniform pressure gradi-ent is established on both sides of the bend. However, for larger angles than 75 deg and until the straight pipe section downstream the bend, strong gradients were measured. The mean and turbu-lence .uctuations of the streamwise velocity were presented for 30 deg, 60 deg, 75 deg, and 90 deg bend angle as well as at 6D downstream and 0.58D upstream the bend. At 30 deg, the maxi-mum streamwise velocity has shifted to the inner wall since the bend alters the .ow direction and a cross-stream pressure gradient is set up, whereas at 90 deg, the maximum streamwise velocity is displaced toward the outer wall. 
LDV measurements of the turbulent developing .ow through a U-bend for Re .5.7 and 11 104 with c .0:15 were later per-formed by Azzola et al. [86], where the longitudinal and azi-muthal velocity components were measured. The experimental results were additionally compared with the results from simula-tions (standard k e model). As the .ow passes through the bend, the r.m.s. of the longitudinal and azimuthal velocities was found to increase due to the additional mean strain associated with the turning of the primary .ow and the secondary-.ow velocity gra-dients created. The agreement between numerical and experimen-tal data was found to be somewhat acceptable by the authors. The largest disagreement between experimental and numerical data was found for the .ow .eld downstream of the bend, even though secondary velocities are decreasing in strength as the .ow recov-ers downstream the bend. The measurement of the r.m.s. of the velocity .uctuations in this study was later found to be erroneous by Lee et al. [91] who performed hot-wire measurements for the same .ow parameters as Azzola et al. [86]. Two other studies pre-senting turbulence statistics as well as investigating sublayer bursting in a U-bend for Re .5 104 and c .0:077 are the ones by Anwer et al. [88] and Anwer and So [92]. Miniature hot-wire and wall-static pressure measurements were performed at various stations upstream and downstream the bend providing among others the Reynolds stress tensor in the horizontal and normal planes at various streamwise locations (z=D .18;1;1;6;10;18;30;and 49, where the negative and positive signs denote the location upstream and downstream the straight pipe sections connected to the bend, respectively). The mean streamwise veloc-ity pro.le at 18D upstream the bend was undisturbed from the bend by agreeing with other available data on the fully developed turbulent .ow. However, 1D upstream the bend the mean stream-wise velocity pro.le along the x-axis starts to deviate from the fully developed state and with respect to the vertical plane it is no longer axisymmetric. 
The mean streamwise velocity pro.le is not recovered to its ini-tial fully developed state even at 18D downstream the bend. Along the bend, the .ow never reaches a fully developed state in contrast to the results obtained by Rowe [90], whereas all the Reynolds normal stresses increase compared to a straight pipe until the bend exit is reached. The study also supports the exis-tence of an additional cell (apart from the Dean vortex) existing in the half pipe cross section of the bend, which as the authors claim was also found in Ref. [90]. The .ndings were supported by means of k e modeling and comparison of their results with pressure measurements [90]. That ¡°secondary¡± cell starts to appear somewhere between 67 deg and 112 deg bend angle and then gradually dissolves until it disappears at a distance of 1D downstream the bend. The authors concluded that since this cell could be found from previous total pressure measurements [90], it should be pressure driven just like the Dean vortices. The exis-tence of additional cells in the bend was later investigated by other authors by means of turbulence modeling and will be discussed in Sec. 4.2.2. In a follow-up study, Anwer and So [92] investigated the sublayer bursting in a turbulent .ow in a curved pipe using the same set up as in Ref. [88] and the variable interval time averag-ing technique¡ªsee, for example, Ref. [93]¡ªin order to identify burst events. Among others, it was veri.ed that convex curvature tends to stabilize the .ow [1], whereas concave curvature and deceleration enhance the bursting frequency. 
The most extensive and well-cited studies on turbulent statistics of .ows in 90 deg and 180 deg bends are the ones by Sudo et al. [82,88]. Hot-wire measurements in a 90 deg bend at Re .6 104 and c .0:5 were performed in Ref. [87] and provided the three components of mean and .uctuating velocities as well as Reyn-olds stresses at various cross sections along and downstream the bend by rotating a probe with an inclined hot-wire. The authors con.rmed that up to 30 deg bend angle the high mean streamwise velocity was shifted toward the inner wall, and at 30 deg bend angle the Dean vortices were formed, see Fig. 15. At the exit of the 90 deg bend, the main .ow was nonuniform with the high velocity toward the outer wall and the low velocity toward the inner wall. The distribution of the streamwise velocity becomes smoother as the distance from the bend increased, whereas the Dean vortices start to decay due to dissipation. However, the secondary .ow was observed even at 10D distance from the bend exit (see Fig. 15). The turbulence intensity increases in the outer part of the cross section between 0 deg and 30 deg, in response to an increase of the longitudinal velocity gradients in the radial direction. However, high values of turbulence intensity were found at the inner pipe wall at 60 deg. At 90 deg bend angle, the maxima of the turbulence inten-sity (w0=Wb) was settled at the inner bend. 
The data from Ref. [87] have served as a benchmark for the val-idation of computational data [94,95]. Similar results were shown in another study by Sudo et al. [84] for a U-bend, where the .ow characteristics are almost the same with a 90 deg bend for angles up to 60 deg curvature. At 90 deg, the secondary .ow starts to

weaken with the highest streamwise velocity being located at the upper and lower pipe walls, whereas the low velocity is located at the pipe center. Measurements at downstream stations from the bend showed the higher streamwise velocity being shifted to the outer wall at 1D and it remained so until 10D distance from the bend. Lee et al. [91] extended the study by Azzola et al. [86]by performing hot-wire measurements using a slanted wire which could be rotated into six orientations. The measurements were performed at different angles and downstream stations (up to 16D) from a 180 deg bend at the same .ow parameters as in Ref. [86]. The authors compared mean velocity and r.m.s. pro.les of the longitudinal and azimuthal components with the ones by Azzola et al., and the agreement was found to be good. 
4.2.2 Turbulence Modeling¡ªStatistics. Since the early 1970s, Reynolds-averaged Navier¨CStokes (RANS) models have been

employed in order to predict the .ow in curved pipes (see, for example, Refs. [96] and [97]), even though it is expected that those will not be successful due to the anisotropic nature of turbu-lence, the secondary motion imposed by the curvature, and separa-tion. Reynolds stress models (RSMs) are expected to perform better when turbulence is anisotropic and curvature is present than eddy-viscosity models (EVM) [98], however, even those have been shown to fail also for small curvature ratios (see, for exam-ple, the recent efforts by Noorani [99] and R€
ohrig et al. [100]). 
One of the .rst efforts to predict the .ow through a bend by means of turbulence modeling was made in 1975 by Patankar et al. [101] using the k e model. They compared the results with experiments by Rowe [90] for a developing .ow in a 180 deg bend, and with the data of, among others, Mori and Nakayama 
[102] for a fully developed .ow in a helical pipe. Friction factors for fully developed .ow were also compared with the experimen-tal data by Ito [52]. The agreement was quite poor and especially for the calculated friction factors (see Fig. 16), the disagreement between the computations and the experiments was 8%. 
Al-Rafai et al. [103], performed experiments and numerical cal-culations for a turbulent .ow at Re .3:4 104 in two bends with c .0:07 and 0.14. Measurements were performed by means of LDV, whereas a k e model was employed for calculating the .ow. The main results consisted of mean and r.m.s. streamwise velocities which showed the anticipated result that the secondary .ow is stronger in the bend with the higher c. The agreement of the results from the modeling with the experimental data was again not good, however, the authors remarked that it was ¡°encouraging¡± in view of the simpli.ed assumptions and short-comings of the model. Hilgenstock and Ernst [104] tested two common turbulence models (k e and renormalization group known as RNG) and provided acceptable results for a .ow in an out-of-plane bend (see, e.g., Fig. 12(d)), showing that among the tested models, the RNG model performed slightly better, however, at a four times higher computational cost. 
The performance of various turbulence models was tested also later on by Pruvost et al. [94] for 90 deg and 180 deg curved pipes, based on the .ows examined experimentally by Anwer and So 
[17] and Sudo et al. [87]. The results from various models with three types of near-wall strategies (wall-function, a two-layer zonal model, and low-Re k e model with boundary layer resolu-tion) compared to experiments showed again that the RSM model predicts the .ow more accurately compared to EVM. Compari-sons with the data by Sudo et al. [87] were also performed by Hellstr€om and Fuchs [95] using the RNG k e model but the agreement was rather poor, especially at the inner wall of the bend where the computed streamwise velocity was underestimated. 
Sugiyama and Hitomi [105] analyzed the development of turbu-lent .ow in a 180 deg bend using an algebraic RSM. The results were compared with the experimental data, and the authors found

that the model is capable of predicting quantitatively the mean .ow, however, the r.m.s of the velocity .uctuations was underpre-dicted. Pellegrini et al. [106] tested different turbulence models at transitional Reynolds numbers and showed that the performance of the models varies signi.cantly depending on the wall treatment chosen. Di Piazza and Ciofalo [107] compared pressure drop and heat transfer data from DNS and (available) experiments with results from various turbulence models (k e, shear stress trans-port k x, and RSM k x) for a coiled tube. The RSM x model was the only one found to be in good agreement with the experimental results for the friction factor for a fully turbulent .ow. 
By using DNS results [81], modeling shortcomings were exam-ined, as, for example, modeling the eddy-viscosity instead of the complete Reynolds-stress tensor, which is a simplicity used often, especially in industry. The turbulent viscosity constant for both straight and curved pipes and for different Reynolds numbers was computed and plotted. The values were quite constant along the radius for the straight pipe but for the bend they varied at the pipe core. From the results, it was shown that for small curvature ratios (c .0:01), the constant was distributed more homogeneously, and therefore, it is expected that the model in that case can pro-vide reasonable results, however, for higher curvatures it would most likely fail, since no explicit representation of turbulence ani-sotropy is present in the model. 
4.2.3 Turbulence Modeling¡ªSecondary Flows. A matter that has been studied through turbulence modeling in the early 1990s was the existence of turbulence-driven secondary .ow in a curved tube of circular cross section. In a straight duct with noncircular cross section, it is known that streamwise vortices are formed due to local variation in Reynolds stresses and are known as Prandtl¡¯s secondary .ow of the second kind or ¡°turbulence-driven¡± second-ary .ow [108]¡ªwhereas the secondary .ow of the .rst kind is induced by skewing of the mean .ow, such as in curved channels. There have been some studies which support the existence of such Reynolds-stress induced secondary .ow for curved pipes of circu-lar cross section as well. Experimental and numerical studies suggested that in the cross-stream half plane, there are three cells appearing when the .ow is turbulent: a Dean cell and a second cell formed near the pipe center as a result of a local imbalance of centrifugal force and radial pressure gradient as well as a third, turbulence-driven cell appearing in conjunction with the Dean cell. When the .ow is laminar, a separation cell exists at the inner wall, which, when the .ow is turbulent has been suggested to dis-appear. Lai et al. [109] performed computations using a RSM and showed the existence of three vortex pairs within a U-bend at Re .5 104 and c .0:077. The primary vortex pair was the Dean vortices, which is driven by the centrifugal forces and is always present in a curved pipe. A second pair existed near the pipe core as a consequence of local imbalance between the cen-trifugal force and the pressure gradient, and .nally, a third pair of vortices was found near the outer bend embedded in the Dean vor-tices, see Fig. 17. This pair of vortices started to appear around 60 deg from the bend entrance, reached a maximum strength at the bend exit, and disappeared at about 7D downstream distance from the bend. This additional pair or vortices was not found for developing laminar curved-pipe .ows, and consequently, it was believed that this is a secondary .ow driven due to the anisotropy of the turbulent normal stresses and their gradients. Those results agreed qualitatively with the experiments in Refs. [86] and [88], however, later on, it was found [17] that the experiments were of limited resolution and were not able to capture such structures. The existence of a third cell is not validated, and there have been no studies¡ªto the best of our knowledge¡ªperformed on the mat-ter during the last two decades. 


Somehow surprisingly, it is still a matter of debate, how effec-tively RANS models can be used for the study of .ows in curved pipes, where secondary .ow and separation are or can be present. The most recent study where an extensive comparative assessment of how RANS and LES can handle .ows with streamline curva-ture and potential separation regions is the one by R€
ohrig et al. [100]. Two models, an eddy-viscosity and a Reynolds-stress model, were compared to LES and particle image velocimetry (PIV) data by Kalpakli and €u[110]. The agreement between
Orl€the models and the experiments was again poor, with the RSM models performing slightly better, as apparent also from Fig. 18. The agreement between the experiments and LES, on the other hand, was fairly good, both regarding statistics and capturing the instantaneous .ow .elds (an example is shown in Fig. 19). 
The .rst effort to employ LES considering an in.nitely long curved pipe using periodic boundary conditions was, however, done much earlier, in the late 1990s by Boersma and Nieuwstadt [111,112]. The results for the mean .ow as well as the r.m.s. of the velocity .uctuations were presented for c .0:01 and 0.05 and Reynolds number of approximately Re .38 103. The simula-tions showed that the r.m.s. is enhanced at the outer wall of the bend and suppressed at the inner, whereas in contrast to straight pipe .ow, the Reynolds stresses were found to be larger at the center of the pipe than compared to straight pipes. 
Most LES studies in curved pipes that have been performed since then have shown how LES can capture the secondary .ow in time (Ref. 
[113], see also Sec. 4.3). A method combining also LES with a characteristic-based split scheme was proposed by Tan et al. [114] to investigate the turbulent .ow in a 90 deg bend with two curvature ratios (c .0:25 and 0.5). Separation at the inner bend wall was only observed for the sharper bend (c .0:5). The method was validated against experiments by Sudo et al. [87], but only for c .0:25 it was found to be successful. Detached eddy simulation which is computationally less expensive than LES has also been used by Wang et al. [115]. The authors com-pared results in terms of the pressure coef.cient along the 90 deg pipe with experimental data by Tan et al. [114] at different Reyn-olds and curvature ratios providing only a qualitative comparison. 
4.2.4 DNS. In this section, studies which have employed DNS for the study of curved pipe .ows are presented separately from other computational models. Even though the .rst efforts to employ DNS in curved pipe .ows started in the late 1990s-beginning of the 2000s [116,117], not many DNS studies in such .ows have been performed since then, probably due to the high computational cost. In any case, most of the studies considered either a helical or toroidal pipe, where the .ow is fully developed and streamwise homogeneous (contrary to the .ow in spatially developing curved pipes), using the orthogonal helical coordinate system introduced by Germano [118,119] to express the Navier¨CStokes equations for helical pipes. Helical pipes differ from curved pipes in a sense that apart from curvature effects, a torsion effect also exists, induced by the pitch of the coil (see Fig. 1). However, in most practical examples, the coil pitch is small compared to the diameter of the coil, and essentially, the coil can be considered as a torus. It has also been shown that mild torsion does not have a signi.cant effect on global quantities [120]. The .ow phenomena observed in a torus are similar to those observed in spatially developing bends (e.g., with respect to the secondary motion, see as an example Ref. [121], where cross-sectional instantaneous .elds in a torus are compared to those obtained downstream a 90 deg bend), and it has the advantage that the .ow is continuous and periodic boundary conditions can be applied, which is bene.cial for DNS.10 
The .rst DNS of a fully developed turbulent .ow in a curved pipe for Re .5 103 and c .0:2 were performed by Boersma and Nieuwstadt [116], mainly show-ing the capability of performing DNS in such .ows by presenting mean cross-sectional .elds obtained from two different initial conditions. 
A few years later, H€
uttl and Friedrich [117,122] performed DNS to investigate turbulence statistics in straight, curved, and helically coiled pipes, having as initial condition a fully developed turbulent .ow starting from a straight pipe. In the earlier study by the authors, a range of curvature ratios (c .0;0:01;and 0:1) and torsions (s .0;0:11;and 0:165) was applied in order to study their effect on the turbulence characteristics. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) was found to exhibit much lower values from the case with high curvature ratio compared to straight pipe .ow, whereas secondary motion became much stronger for high torsion. The TKE also increased with increased torsion for the same cur-vature ratio. Mean and r.m.s. of the azimuthal and radial velocities as well as Reynolds shear stresses and TKE along horizontal and vertical cuts in a pipe cross section were presented for Reynolds number around Re .6 103. Mean and r.m.s. velocities were the main results shown in Ref. [122] for Re .5:6 103 and c .0:1. 
10On the other hand, experiments in a closed torus are practically dif.cult to be realized due to limited technical possibilities to maintain the .ow in the torus, but in some cases it is still feasible (see, for example, the introduction in Ref. [61]).

The main conclusion from that work was that the turbulence intensity in a curved pipe is lower compared to a straight pipe. 
DNS of the fully developed turbulent .ow in straight and curved pipes (c .0:01 and 0.1) at moderate Reynolds numbers (Re .5:3 103 and 1:2 104) were studied by Noorani et al. [81]. For the .rst time, complete Reynolds stress budgets were presented in that study. The local axial wall shear stress was found to be signi.cantly higher at the outer wall compared to the inner side. For the highest Re and c case studied, the wall shear showed a plateau at the inner wall indicating relaminarization (Fig. 20), whereas distinct oscillations were found near the outer wall. The Dean vortices were observed in the mean for c .0:01 having an appearance similar to that of laminar .ow at low Dean numbers but for the higher curvature ratio case, the core of the vortices moved toward the side walls and a distinct ¡°bulge¡± region appeared in the pipe center, see Fig. 21. This region was found to be connected to enhancement of the TKE in the core of the pipe bend. However, the authors did not investigate this further in terms of how near-wall turbulence could be affected by the pres-ence of this region of high turbulence production. 
More recently, Di Liberto et al. [123] investigated the turbulent .ow in curved pipes for three cases of (c, Re) .e0;1:7 104), (0.1, 1:5 104), and (0.3, 1:2 104Tby DNS. It was shown that the overall turbulence levels decreased for a curved pipe

compared to the straight one, whereas increasing the curvature ratio leads to a further reduction of the turbulence levels. It was also suggested that increasing the curvature ratio stabilized the Dean vortices since no .uctuations were found for that case in the core region as for the lowest examined curvature ratio. Finally, the most recent DNS study is the one by Noorani and Schlatter [121], however, this will be discussed in Sec. 4.3, as this work did not focus on statistics but concerned mainly the evolution of the Dean vortices in time and the so-called swirl-switching phenomenon. 
4.3 Swirl Switching: Rocking or Rolling?. The turbulent .ow in curved pipes and especially the behavior of the Dean vorti-ces is the subject of several studies, most of them conducted dur-ing the last decade [100,124¨C128]. It is notable that the .rst major study on turbulent .ow in bends was carried out in the late 1960s [129], and it took three decades for a second study to be per-formed [130] on the matter. In the study by Tunstall and Harvey (hereafter [129] referred to as TH68), almost .ve decades ago, for the .rst time it was shown that the turbulent .ow through sharp bends differs from the vortex pattern existing for laminar curved pipe .ow, i.e., the counter-rotating Dean cells being symmetrical to the plane of symmetry in time. Visualizations of the .ow in an elbow showed the existence of a single swirling vortex which was rotating alternatingly in the clockwise and anticlockwise direc-tions with a frequency corresponding to a Strouhal number St .0.002, de.ned here as 
St .fD=Wb (4) 
where f denotes the frequency. A .ag placed between golden-plated contacts was additionally mounted where the switching of the vortex was detected from the visualizations. The output from a transducer placed upstream of the .ag showed that the .ow was dominated by two distinct states that interchanged abruptly, an anticlockwise and a clockwise-rotating vortex dominating the .ow .eld alternatingly. Spectra of the axial velocity component and wall-pressure close to the outer and at the inner pipe wall con-cluded that this ¡°switching¡± was occurring with a frequency corre-sponding to St .0:002, agreeing with the visualizations. Finally, to account for Reynolds number and curvature ratio effects, a series of measurements were performed for various curvatures and a Reynolds number range Re .4 22 104. The switching was found for all the cases with frequencies increasing with the Reynolds number and corresponding to Strouhal numbers between 
0.001 and 0.004. The study .nally concluded that in order for the switching of the vortices to be triggered, the .ow must be turbu-lent and the bend should be sharp enough to cause separation, sug-gesting that the origin of the phenomenon lies on the .ow

upstream of the bend but also the separation bubble at the inner bend corner. 
The phenomenon observed by TH68 was overlooked from the .uid dynamics¡¯ community for several decades until the study by Br€
ucker in 1998 [130] where¡ªamong others¡ªthe term ¡°swirl switching¡± was assigned to it for the .rst time. Two-dimensional two-component PIV (2D2C) measurements were performed in a sharp bend (c .0:5) for Re .2 103 and 5 103. For the low-est Reynolds number, the switching of the secondary .ow as described by TH68 was not observed. However, for the higher Reynolds number case, at which the .ow is expected to be turbu-lent, the Dean vortices were found to alternatingly push one another toward the lower or upper half of the pipes with respect to the plane of symmetry, see Fig. 22. Three distinct peaks were identi.ed from power spectral density of the time signal of the tangential velocity component at a point close to the inner wall of the bend. Those frequencies corresponded to St .0:03, 0.12, and 
0.2. This observation supports the fact that such oscillatory motion exists only for turbulent .ows as suggested in TH68, however, the .ow pattern that was observed by Br€
ucker was different from the single dominating cell pattern observed in TH68. A similar pattern to the one captured by Br€
ucker was later on visualized by means of time-resolved stereoscopic PIV (TS-PIV) by Kalpakli et al. 
[131] (where the same motion as the one found by Br€
ucker was described as ¡°rocking¡± of the cells) as well as in a follow-up work 
[110] and a recent DNS study in a torus [121] (see Fig. 22). 
Until the beginning of the 21st century, only the studies by TH68 and Br€
ucker on the swirl switching were available¡ªwith the one by Br€
ucker [130] being the only one providing quantita-tive visualizations of the phenomenon¡ªand it was believed that separation and turbulence were necessary conditions for it to appear. In more recent years, three main concerns have driven the studies on the swirl switching, as it will be described in the fol-lowing. First, from the two early studies by TH68 and Br€
ucker [130], it was made clear that the Dean vortices oscillate at a low frequency, however, how this frequency is affected by .ow parameters such as the Reynolds number or the curvature of the bend was unknown. Spectra of either the time series [110] or the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) time coef.cients [124,126,132] were employed in order to investigate this. The latter method which stands for proper orthogonal decomposition was used by many authors [110,124¨C126,132] in order to .lter the .ow .eld and decompose the large-scale structures from small-scale turbulence. POD is known to rank the .ow structures or so-called modes by energy content: the mean .eld accounts for more than half of the energy, typically more than 90% in steady .ows [133]. POD-based low-order reconstruction of turbulent pipe .ows has recently become quite popular, especially when PIV data are at hand [134] because it allows for a better visualization of coherent structures present in turbulent .ow .elds. For the swirl switching studies that applied POD, the observed modal pat-tern in most of the studies had a speci.c trend: the .rst two most energetic modes (excluding the one representing the mean) depict either the Dean vortices tilted or a single vortex with its center located at the pipe centerline, spanning the whole pipe cross sec-tion. Those modes have been shown to switch order (in terms of energy) with downstream distance from the bend exit [125,132]. Finally, whether the origin of the switching is connected to the separation at the inner bend corner or upstream .ow conditions/ structures is a matter that has been investigated during the last decade [128]. 

The concern about the frequency of the switching as well as the role of separation in the switching mechanism was investigated by means of LES by R€
utten et al. in two similar papers [18,113] with the second one being the most well-cited. Those investigations showed¡ªin contrast to TH68¡ªthat the swirl switching is not caused by the separation at the inner bend corner because spectra of the forces onto the pipe walls showed distinct peaks for both a sharp (c .0:5) and a mild (c .0:17) bend, where in the latter one separation was not observed. Spectral analysis was also per-formed on the time series of the position of the ¡°stagnation point¡± (the minimum of wh wr 2, where wh and wr are the azimuthal
2 t
and radial velocity component, respectively) at the inner wall to check whether a correlation exists between the forces on the walls, the stagnation point movement, and the alternating domination of the Dean vortices. Both spectra from the forces and the stagnation point showed low-frequency oscillations at St .0:0055 [18] and St .0:01 [113] for Re .2:7 104. That frequency was found to agree with the switching frequencies found in TH68 by extrapolat-ing those measurements to the Reynolds number employed in the LES.11 
Higher frequency peaks at St .0:2 and 0.3 were also present in the LES spectra which were interpreted as shear layer instabilities. It was additionally found that the stagnation point¡ª and therefore the Dean vortices¡ªwas not abruptly switching between two stable positions (as suggested by TH68 and Br€
ucker [130]) but rather moving smoothly between azimuthal positions within 640 deg [113]. 
LES of a curved pipe .ow with the same .ow parameters as the experiments by Sudo et al. [87] were also conducted by Hellstr€
om and Fuchs [95]. The LES agreed well with the experiments, and the swirl switching pattern visualized by the LES agreed well with the observations by R€
utten et al. [113]. The .rst POD analysis of the swirl switching, which was done in this LES study, showed a periodic variation of the most energetic modes which corresponds to St .0.5. However, this was probably a subharmonic of the sampling frequency, rather than a physical frequency. 
An effort to identify the switching motion of the Dean vortices was made by Sakakibara et al. [132] by applying POD on TS-PIV data, acquired at z=D .2 ¨C15 downstream the bend exit for Re .
1:2 105 and c .0:75. The swirl switching was reconstructed using the most energetic modes, being the mode representing the mean and the .rst two modes related to the .uctuating part of the .ow. It was shown that the most energetic mode related to the .uctuating part at the z=D .2 resembles the switching motion as 
11However, one should note that this comparison was misleading since the Reynolds number used in TH68 (Re .2:2 105) misinterpreted by R€
was utten et al. [18] (as Re .2:2 104). Therefore, the extrapolation made by the authors was invalid since the difference in Reynolds number between the study by TH68 and Ref. [18] is too large. 
described in TH68, i.e., a single vortex switching direction alter-natingly from anticlockwise to clockwise rotation. However, this mode decayed as the .ow evolved from 2D further downstream and became weaker than the second mode at 2D. This second mode was found to be responsible for a rotation of the plane of symmetry of the Dean cells as described in Ref. [130]. Further-more, spectra of the second temporal mode at 2D showed a peak at St .0:07. This study showed¡ªamong others¡ªthe capability of POD to .lter and suppress small-scale turbulence in PIV data (where spatial resolution is limited) and consequently, emphasize the swirl switching (being a large-scale phenomenon). POD has since then been used in numerous studies investigating the swirl switching mechanism, one of the earlier ones being the study by Kalpakli and €u[110], where it was shown that the switching of 
Orl€the Dean vortices could be reconstructed by using only the .rst six POD modes. 
In a follow-up paper, Sakakibara and Machida [128] also inves-tigated the connection between structures existing upstream of the bend and the swirl switching mechanism for Re .2:7 104 and c .0:5. The azimuthal displacement of the stagnation point was found to be correlated to streaks existing upstream of the bend that was 7¨C8D long, see Fig 23. Those streaks were suggested to be related to the very large-scale motions (VLSMs, see, for exam-ple, Ref. [135]), though being much shorter in length compared to the VLSMs as known for turbulent pipe .ow studies in straight pipes. The authors concluded that the streaks are responsible for the oscillatory motion of the vortices, which adds another possible explanation (apart from separation as claimed in TH68) for the cause of the swirl switching. 
A similar effort as the one made in Ref. [132], i.e., to identify the origin of the swirl switching through POD analysis of data obtained at different downstream stations from the bend, was done by Hellstr€
om et al. [126]. The Reynolds number in this study was Re .2:5 104 and c .0:5. Flow .elds at three downstream distances from the bend exit (5, 12, and 18D) were acquired by means of TS-PIV. In that case, the reconstruction of the swirl switching was done considering only the most energetic modes related to the .uctuating part of the .ow, i.e., the mode represent-ing the mean was not included. This was based on the fact that (even in an earlier preliminary work [89]), the Dean vortices were seen only in the mean vorticity maps and not in the instantaneous ones. The authors concluded that the Dean vortices are weak and they were, therefore, not considered in the reconstruction process. Additionally, the Dean vortices in the mean vorticity map were not symmetrical and as the authors remarked: ¡°the mean vorticity [¡­] shows the tilted Dean motion as mentioned by Ref. [130]. The mean .ow structures are, however, not evident among the much higher levels of instantaneous vorticity¡± [126]. It should, however, be kept in mind, that in such turbulent .ows as the ones described here, the levels of instantaneous vorticity will always be higher than in the mean. Furthermore, small turbulent scales which cannot be resolved due to the limited spatial resolution of the PIV will appear as noise in the instantaneous vorticity maps. Therefore, in order to obtain a meaningful representation of the .ow .eld, appropriate .ltering of the data, in order to suppress the small scales, is important. Additionally, the comparison of the two studies at this point is misleading since a mean quantity (vorticity) in the case of Ref. [124] is not comparable to instantaneous quan-tities shown in Ref. [130]. The .rst POD mode at all the down-stream stations depicted (similarly to the .rst POD mode seen by Sakakibara et al. [132]at z=D .2, see above) a single vortex spanning the entire cross section and rotating in the clockwise and anticlockwise direction as the .ow evolved downstream the bend (Fig. 24). This mode was found to be associated with St .0:33 through spectra of its temporal counterpart. The second and third mode depicted two Dean cells tilted with respect to the plane of symmetry with one of the cells being considerably suppressed. The second mode was associated with St .0:16, nd was referred to as ¡°tilted Dean vortices.¡± This is similar to the mode appearing as the most energetic one in Ref. [110] but also in recent LES and DNS studies which will be discussed later in this section. The authors concluded that the tilting of the Dean cells is a transitional state between two states of the swirl switching, during which one of the cells is being suppressed resulting in a single vortex (shown as the .rst mode in the POD analysis). The time-scale of those transitions corresponds to structures of length 0.25¨C2.5D. Finally, it was proposed that the suppression of one of the Dean cells was related to the shear .ow region at the inner bend corner which is in return sensitive to upstream conditions, supporting the .ndings by Sakakibara and Machida [128]. 


A similar modal pattern as the one described by Sakakibara et al. [132] and Hellstr€
om et al. [126] was observed by Kalpakli et al. [125]. The evolution of the POD modes downstream (1, 2, and 3D) a mild (c .0:14) and sharp (c .0:39) bend was investi-gated in this study. At all the downstream stations where data were acquired, the .rst mode also depicted a single vortex span-ning the whole cross section, whereas the second and third modes depicted the tilted Dean vortices with one of them also being sup-pressed. In the same study, the .rst effort to control the swirl switching was made; a honeycomb was mounted at the inlet of the bend with the aim to suppress any unsteady upstream structures and at the same time reduce the turbulence intensity. In the case when the honeycomb was mounted, the modal pattern changed substantially compared to when the honeycomb was not present, possibly indicating a diminishing or delay of the switching. 
The study by Carlsson et al. [124] addresses both the connec-tion between VLSMs and switching as well as the shape of the POD modes for a variety of curvature ratios at the same Reynolds number and downstream location from the bend as in Ref. [110] by means of LES. The agreement between the LES and the

experimental data [110] was rather poor with regard to the mean velocity pro.les, however, the POD analysis of the LES data iden-ti.ed the same modes as found from the POD analysis of the experimental data. The authors observed St .0.13 from their fre-quency spectra analysis in the upstream straight pipe section and interpreted that as existence of large-scale structures (VLSMs). They suggested that the swirl switching is connected to those structures. 
Recent DNS by Noorani and Schlatter [121] in a torus (i.e., in.nitely long curved pipe) indicate that the swirl switching can-not be caused by neither separation nor large-scale structures existing upstream from the bend and con.icts with some of the above studies [124,128] but also with the initial study by TH68. That is simply because the swirl switching was observed in the toroidal pipe as well, exactly in the same manner as in previous experimental studies (clearly depicted in Fig. 22) showing even the same modal pattern as in Refs. [110] and [124]. In a torus, there are no upstream conditions as well as no local separation, therefore this excludes those two as the necessary conditions for the swirl switching to be present. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what exactly is the role of separation or upstream structures in the way the switching is formed. The spatial mode that was found from the POD analysis in the DNS study by Noorani and Schlatter [121], but also earlier in experiments [110] and LES [124], resem-bles antisymmetric Dean vortices seen also as the second POD mode in Ref. [126], see Fig. 25 
for an illustration. It was shown that this is the dominant mode that might cause the swirl switch-ing and it is only related to the curvature itself, whereas the single-swirl-mode observed earlier [125,126] did not exist in that study. This suggests that this mode is not part of the swirl switching mechanism but could instead be related to the down-stream straight sections from the bend, which are not present in the case of the torus. The study by Kalpakli et al. [125] showed, for example, that in a mild bend (where most probably separation did not occur), the oscillations were weaker compared to a sharp bend. In the same study, the insert of a honeycomb upstream of the bend which is expected to damp any large-scale structures indicated delay of the switching. Therefore, it could be that some .ow features enhance or delay the swirl switching but are not nec-essarily the cause of it. 
At this point, it should also be mentioned that a series of stud-ies, which have been published during the last decade [136¨C138], investigated the behavior of the secondary motion in bends com-prising the cooling system of a nuclear reactor (Japan sodium-cooled fast reactor, JSFR), however, without assigning the term swirl switching to their observations. The results from these stud-ies dealt mainly with the vortex shedding from the separation region, and the frequency spectra showed only peaks at frequen-cies corresponding to Strouhal numbers higher than St .0.4. However, a similar phenomenon resembling the swirl switching motion as captured in Ref. [131] has also been revealed, for exam-ple, through PIV measurements in Ref. [127]. The PIV measure-ments were performed in two elbow bends resembling the cold-and hot-leg pipings existing in the cooling system of the JSFR, and measurements were taken both along the bends and at down-stream cross sections. The two Dean vortices were found to alter-natingly dominate the .ow .eld rotating in the clockwise and anticlockwise directions in a periodic manner, whereas separation was captured at the inner bend corner. It was believed that this periodical .ow, that looked similar to what other authors have referred to as swirl switching, affected the behavior of the separa-tion region near the inner wall. The above references have been largely neglected in the literature even though the phenomena observed could be connected to the so-called swirl switching and those are the only ones dealing with very high Reynolds number (e.g., Re .4:2 107 in Ref. [127]). 
A list of the aforementioned studies dealing with the swirl switching including some of the parameters under which they were conducted are summarized in Table 2. From the above, it is made clear that the swirl-switching phenomenon interests many research groups and as has been underlined, this oscillatory motion can cause fatigue, increase noise, and lead to failures in industrial systems which consist of bends and conduits and where the .ow is highly turbulent, such as in the cooling systems of nuclear plants. And even though the interest on this phenomenon has increased during the last decade, many open questions still remain. First of all, the pattern of the switching itself is unclear, i.e., are the Dean vortices ¡°rocking¡± in between two distinct states or does each one of them as a single vortex smoothly ¡°roll¡±

alternatingly in time. Furthermore, the origin of the switching of the Dean vortices is still unclear: is it connected to VLSMs, is sep-aration a possible trigger or could it just be a result of an instabil-ity mechanism in the bend itself. Finally, the possibility of control of the switching is an unexplored .eld which could provide possi-ble practical ways to avoid fatigue of piping systems. 
5 Swirling Flow 
When a swirling motion is superimposed on the main .ow, the balance between centrifugal, inertial, and viscous forces in the curved pipe changes. Turbulent swirling .ow is encountered in many technical applications such as in hydraulic plants, combus-tion chambers, and any machine that involves a turbine or fan or a combination of bends, e.g., double bends [140]. As apparent from a recent study [141], the work that has been done on swirling tur-bulent .ow in bends is not very extensive, compared to, for instance, work that has been done in swirling turbulent .ow in straight pipes (see as a reference Table 3 
extended from Ref. [141], where studies in straight and curved pipes with and without swirl are listed). 
For the generation of swirl, a number of different methods exist (pipe rotation, tangential injection, and vanes), which have a dif-ferent effect on the base .ow. For details, the reader is referred to Ref. [142]. This section will mostly refer to studies using the rota-tion method, i.e., through axially rotating a straight pipe section upstream the bend, since it provides a well-de.ned velocity pro.le and does not leave traces of the swirl generating mechanism (such as other means to introduce swirl on the .ow). 
In cases where the swirling motion is introduced by imposing a secondary .ow or by means of passive methods (guiding vanes), one needs to calculate an integral swirl number, de.ned as the ratio between the .uxes of angular momentum to streamwise momentum [142]. Such a swirl number has been de.ned by Gupta et al. [143] as follows: 
eR e2p WUhr 2 dr dh 
00
Sint .eR e2p (5) 
RW2rdrdh 00 
where Uh is the circumferential velocity, and r and h the radial and angular coordinates, respectively. 
When the .ow is in solid-body rotation, the imposed swirl intensity can be approximated in terms of the mean angular velocity (X) of the rotating motion related to the mean bulk veloc-ity as follows [94]: 
XR 
SSB .(6)
2Wb 
However, when the whole pipe is rotated to create the swirl motion and the .ow is turbulent, the .ow is not in solid-body rota-tion [144], see also below in the following paragraphs. In that case, the imposed swirling motion can be expressed through the swirl number de.ned here as 
Uw
S .(7)Wb 
with Uw being the pipe wall velocity. This is a quite common expression used in recent studies, and its de.nition is also adapted here. The above swirl numbers are connected to each other; when the mean axial velocity is constant for a plug .ow and Uh has a linear variation, the integral swirl number becomes equal to the swirl number for a .uid in solid-body rotation, whereas from Eqs. 
(6) 
and (7), we get S .2SSB. 
For turbulent .ow in straight pipes with imposed swirl, a num-ber of studies have been performed and it is now well-known that swirl decreases the pressure drop [145]. The mean streamwise velocity pro.le becomes less full and approaches the one of a lam-inar .ow [146,147]. It has been shown that in the case of turbulent swirling .ow, due to the cross-stream Reynolds stresses, the .uid is not in solid-body rotation but the azimuthal velocity pro.le is nearly parabolic [144,148,149]. Furthermore, an increase in the swirl intensity has been shown to decrease the turbulence intensity [149,150]. More recent three-dimensional LDV measurements of turbulent swirling straight pipe .ow by Rocklage-Marliani [151] showed an annihilating effect of the swirl on the Reynolds shear stresses, i.e., the Reynolds stresses were found to be low in the pipe core region, therefore suggesting that the swirl tends to lami-narize the .ow. One of the .rst LES performed on turbulent swirl-ing .ow [152] con.rmed the above and showed that the largest decrease in the turbulence intensity is observed for the streamwise velocity component. Early DNS [153] showed that the reduction in drag is responsible for a widening of the near wall structures in a turbulent swirling straight pipe .ow. Those data were used later in Ref. [154] in order to show that LES can reasonably well pre-dict phenomena in rotating turbulent pipe .ows. RSMs were developed by Speziale et al. [155] and were successful in captur-ing the main features of turbulent swirling .ow as described

above. More recent DNS on turbulent swirling .ow in a straight pipe [156] have shown the effect of swirl on near wall structures which appear as elongated streaks being tilted and shortened as the swirl intensity increases. 
The case of a turbulent swirling .ow through a 180 deg curved pipe at Re .5 104 with c .0:077 was examined experimen-tally in Ref. [157] and later in Ref. [17]. The effects of swirl with SSB .0.5 on the secondary .ow were examined through a compar-ison with nonswirling .ow data acquired in the same setup. Wall-static pressure distributions between the swirling and nonswirling cases showed opposite results in the two cases: the static pressure was lower at the outer bend as compared to the pressure at the inner for the swirling .ow whereas the opposite was found for the nonswirling case. The wall shear stress did not show differences between the outer and inner wall whereas for SSB .0, there was a signi.cant difference between the shear at the inner and outer walls due to the existence of the Dean cells in that case. From the mean velocity pro.les along the xz-plane, it was shown that the velocity distribution is more uniform and symmetric for the swirl-ing .ow case. The aforementioned observations suggested that a single dominating cell exists and that the curved-pipe .ow becomes fully dominated by the imposed solid-body rotation. An increase in turbulence production by the imposed swirling motion resulted in more uniform distributions of the Reynolds normal stresses in the radial and tangential directions. As a consequence, the radial and azimuthal gradients of these stresses are reduced, which explains why the secondary .ow created by the bend can-not be sustained. 
The follow-up work by So and Anwer [158] showed that in swirling .ow, the distance needed for the .ow to become fully developed in a curved pipe is shorter than that needed in the case of a straight pipe. Furthermore, it was found that the bend acceler-ates the decay of the swirl compared to swirling .ow in a straight pipe. 
Pruvost et al. [94] numerically studied the same .ow case as in Ref. [17] but extended the investigation for a range of swirl num-bers between SSB .0 and 0.5. An additional case for SSB .2.5 was also studied but no experimental data were available for vali-dation. Different numerical approaches were tested, and the results were compared to the experimental data by Anwer and So 
[17] both for the swirling and nonswirling cases. However, all the models gave poor agreement with the experiments for the mean velocity pro.le and TKE pro.le for SSB .0. For SSB .0.5 the low-Re, k e model gave satisfactory results for the mean veloc-ity, but again the agreement with the experimental data for the TKE pro.le was poor. Nevertheless, it was shown that there exists a complex interaction between the Dean vortices and the swirling motion for small S. As the swirling motion intensi.es, the Dean cells tend to merge into a single cell until the .ow .eld becomes completely swirl dominated. Similar observations about the inter-action between the Dean vortices and the swirling motion in tur-bulent .ow were made by means of PIV experiments by Kalpakli and €u[110] for S .0
Orl€1:2. The difference between that study and the one by Anwer and So [17] is that the swirling motion was created by rotating the whole straight pipe mounted upstream of the bend, whereas in the case of Ref. [17] only a pipe section rotated, therefore, the swirl was decaying downstream the rotated pipe section. Kalpakli and €u[110] showed that even for a low
Orl€swirl intensity, the swirling motion has a stabilizing effect on the .ow, moving the high speed .uid from the outer wall to the center of the pipe. As the authors claim ¡°axisymmetry of the .ow .eld is gradually achieved with increasing swirl number, as the Dean vor-tices merge resulting in a single large-scale motion located almost at the center of the pipe for S .1.2.¡± POD analysis was addition-ally performed in order to decompose the superimposed swirling motion from the turbulent .ow .eld. For S .1.2, the .rst POD mode depicted similar structures to the Dean vortices. Those observations¡ªfrom the .rst quantitative visualization experi-ments in swirling turbulent curved pipe .ow¡ªagreed qualita-tively with the aforementioned simulations in Ref. [94] and are illustrated in Fig. 26. Another aspect investigated by some authors for turbulent swirling .ow in curved pipes is the existence and shape of the so-called VLSMs, which are known to exist for tur-bulent straight pipe .ow [159]. For a curved pipe with c .0:36, 
€
Kalpakli and Orl€showed that .sh-bone-like
u[110] structures exist, similar to those found by Nygard and Andersson [156] for swirling turbulent .ow in a straight pipe, however, those were inclined due to the presence of the bend. Whether those structures were truly VLSMs was not investigated by the authors. The effect of increasing the swirl intensity was further shown to tear up the observed elongated structures, agreeing again with the .ndings by Nygard and Andersson [156] for a straight pipe. 
A database for both statistical and modal analysis for turbulent swirling .ow in a curved pipe was recently made available by Kalpakli Vester et al. [141]. Data from hot-wire and TS-PIV measurements taken at the same experimental conditions as in Ref. [110] were presented and analyzed for a range of Reynolds and swirl numbers. This is also a case more suitable for CFD vali-dations compared to previous data available in the literature [17,157] since the in.ow condition is well-de.ned by rotating the whole straight pipe section connected to the bend, and the swirl intensity remains the same along the pipe. The authors showed the in.uence of increasing swirl intensity on the .ow statistics such as the mean and r.m.s. velocity pro.les which are shown in Fig. 

27. The effects from the bend are clearly smeared out as the swirl strength increases, with the velocity pro.le becoming more uni-form and the higher velocities shifted from the outer pipe wall to the pipe core. 
Other well-known studies which did not use the rotation method to generate swirl should also be brie.y mentioned. One of the earlier studies on swirling .ow is the one in Ref. [160], where swirling .ow through a bend was visualized. Using a Pitot tube, pressure losses in a 180 deg bend were investigated in Ref. [161]. The difference in the formed .ow patterns in the case when the imposed swirling motion is a free-or forced-type vortex was also investigated. Those data were later used to validate a theoretical study of swirling curved pipe .ow [162]. The effects of swirl on the secondary .ow .eld along a bend were also studied in a later work by Chang and Lee [163] through planar PIV measurements for four different Re in the range 1:02:5 104. In that study, the swirling motion was created by tangential inlets. The main observation was that a two-cell pattern existed at the entrance of the bend which disappeared as the .ow developed along the bend with a decrease in swirl intensity. 
6 Pulsating Flow 
Pulsating (or pulsatile) .ow, i.e., the unsteady .ow12 
composed of a periodic and a steady component is typical in biological .ows, such as the respiratory and cardiovascular system (see, for example, the textbook by Pedley [5]). Therefore, the main body of unsteady .ow research has been devoted to physiological .ows [164¨C166]. However, pulsatile .ow occurs in and plays a major role in the performance of technical systems as well, such as reciprocating engines or heat exchangers. Stokes [167] was the .rst to do substantial work on unsteady .ows and today the boundary layer thickness in pulsating .ows bears his name. In a pipe, it is known that due to the nonslip condition at the wall, additional vorticity varying in time needs to be generated in the boundary layer in order to account for the mass-.ow variation under pulsating .ow conditions. In that sense, shear waves are generated, which propagate from the wall into the .uid and are attenuated as they do so [168]. In laminar .ow, the wave attenua-tion is characterized by a length scale, known as the Stokes
p...........
boundary layer and de.ned as ¡®s .2 =x, where x .2pf is the angular frequency of the pulsations and is the kinematic vis-cosity. Stokes showed that the amplitude of the waves are attenu-ated by a factor e .2.71 over a distance equal to ¡®s which means that the higher the pulsation frequency, the thinner the boundary layer. Womersley [169] de.ned a nondimensional parameter, which today bears his name and shows the counteraction between the transient inertial forces and the viscous forces 
r....

a .R (8) 
but can also be seen as a ratio between an outer length scale (R) and the Stokes boundary layer thickness. 
According to the above, the boundary layer is expected to be thick for low Womersley numbers, whereas for large Womersley numbers it is expected to be thin. For example, it has been shown that for highly pulsatile turbulent .ow, the shear waves propagat-ing into the .uid from the wall are strongly attenuated and con-.ned mainly to the viscous sublayer region. The inner and outer layers are hence completely decoupled, and turbulence in the outer region is not affected by the pulsations and can be regarded as frozen, see the reviews in Refs. [168] and [170]. 
For physiological .ows, the Womersley number is small (of order 1) as is the Reynolds numbers whereas in technical applica-tions (such as the internal combustion engine), those numbers 
12It should be noted that unsteady .ows may be divided into two categories: pulsating .ow when the periodically time-averaged velocity is non-zero and oscillating .ow in which the periodically time-averaged velocity is zero.

may be of the order of 102 and 105, respectively. According to Ref. [171], for Womersley numbers smaller than approximately one, the .ow can be considered quasi-steady since the turbulent structures have time to accommodate to the slowly varying .ow rate. For 1 <a <30, the .ow is in an intermediate state (passage between quasi-steady and pulsatile .ow), whereas for a >30 the frequency of the pulsatile motion is high enough for turbulence not to be able to respond to the rapid changes in the .ow and the .ow becomes inertia dominated. Hence, turbulence becomes inde-pendent of the phase angle of the pulsations. In the following, we will focus on previous studies on pulsating turbulent .ow in curved pipes, which as we will see are limited. 
Pulsations are sometimes induced in heat exchangers since investigations have shown that they might increase the heat trans-fer rates [172]. In that respect, pulsatile turbulent .ow has been studied for different pipe con.gurations (mainly coiled tubes) in terms of enhancement of the heat transfer [173,174]. However, until recently, there were no studies¡ªto the best of our knowledge¡ªdealing with the effects of pulsatile .ow on turbulent curved pipe .ow with regard to the secondary .ow evolution or the dynamics of the .ow. Studies in laminar, low-frequency pulsa-tile .ow have already shown that under one cycle, the secondary .ow patterns vary due to competition between the centrifugal, inertial, and viscous forces [166,175,176]. Moreover, studies on the effect of high pulsations (for Womersley numbers a30) on

turbulent curved pipe .ows encountered for example in the inter-nal combustion engine .ow environment are scarce. 
Kalpakli et al. [177] performed stereo PIV (SPIV) and instanta-neous mass .ow and pressure measurements in a unique .ow rig (CICERO rig, see Ref. [178]) that can be run both under steady and highly pulsatile .ow conditions (up to f .100 Hz) for engine-.ow-related studies. The secondary .ow downstream a sharp bend (c .0:4) was captured for a .30 revealing a complex .ow .eld during one pulse period and velocity magnitudes up to four times the bulk velocity. Instantaneous mass .ow and pressure measurements were also performed upstream and downstream a commercial passenger car turbocharger turbine with the bend used for the SPIV measurements mounted at its inlet and for various bulk velocities and 40 Hz pulsatile frequency. Comparisons with a similar study that used a straight pipe as the inlet to the same tur-bine [179] showed that the hysteresis loop in the turbine maps was signi.cantly damped in the case with the bend mounted at the inlet of the turbine. In a follow up study, Kalpakli et al. [180] investigated in more detail the effect of high pulsations (Womers-ley numbers a .41 and 71), on the secondary .ow. TS-PIV meas-urements were performed in a curved pipe of c .0:4, and the .ow .eld at cross sections 0.2D and 2D downstream locations was quantitatively visualized. The .ow structures were captured during one pulsation cycle, and it was shown that four main pat-terns existed: during acceleration and deceleration the .ow pattern resembled the one seen in steady .ow in the mean, i.e., two sym-metrical vortices could be observed. At the peak of acceleration weak secondary motion existed, whereas at the end of the deceler-ation phase the vortices overtake the whole cross section but with their centers located at the centerline of the pipe (see Fig. 28). POD was also for the .rst time applied on a highly pulsating turbulent .ow through a curved pipe, and it was shown that POD reconstruction of the .ow .elds is ¡°superior to phase-averaging, although the latter serves as the main processing tool for pulsatile .ow .elds so far in the literature.¡± The vortices seen in the phase-averaged and POD reconstructed .ow .elds were also observed as the most energetic spatial POD modes. 
A third work by the same group was also published recently 
[181] with its main focus, this time, on the statistical analysis and decomposition of highly pulsating turbulent .ow signals measured by means of a single hot-wire. Among others, the usability and shortcomings of a single hot-wire probe without temperature com-pensation in a highly pulsating .ow were demonstrated and explained. The Reynolds number was Re .2:4 105, and the Womersley number was a .80, which is the highest Womersley number reported¡ªto the best of our knowledge¡ªfor measure-ments in a curved pipe. Time series, phase-averaged, and low-pass .ltered signals, mean and r.m.s. pro.les, probability density function distributions, ensemble-averaged velocity pro.les at vari-ous phase angles, as well as reconstructed signals through singular value decomposition (SVD) were presented and discussed. The SVD was shown to be a more robust and ¡°user-independent¡± tech-nique than digital .ltering and phase-averaging, whereas the decomposition techniques employed were ¡°capable of separating the ¡°background¡± (small-scale) turbulence from the large-scale pulsatile motion. [¡­] indicates that the large-scale pulsatile motion, due to the wide scale separation, is merely superposed on the turbulence¡± [181]. 
7 Summary and Outlook 
Curved pipes are met in a variety of technical applications and give rise to strong secondary .ows, enhanced pressure drop, as well as sometimes low-frequency oscillations. Issues that have been puzzling the .uid dynamics¡¯ community for many decades regarding .ows in curved conduits are of both applied and basic scienti.c interest, namely, transition to turbulence and pressure drop for different bends of practical importance as well as how the secondary motion behaves when the .ow is turbulent, pulsat-ing, and/or swirling. The .ow environment in a curved pipe is challenging to investigate both for experimentalists and numeri-cists due to the .ow¡¯s three-dimensionality (therefore, all the velocity components need to be obtained to get a complete picture of the .ow .eld), occurrence of separation in the inner bend wall, as well as large velocity gradients. Modeling of such .ows is gen-erally favored with RANS models still being largely used in industry, however, it has been shown that due to the complexity of the .ow, simple turbulence models cannot predict such .ow .elds accurately. Instead, highly resolved LES or DNS need to be performed, which need to be validated against experiments and are computationally expensive and restricted to moderate/low Reynolds numbers, respectively. 

One of the matters that to a large extent is still an unexplored area is the transition from laminar to turbulent .ow in curved pipes. It is noticeable that the .rst instability analysis on curved pipe .ow was performed in 2016 [19], even though studies on the transition to turbulence in curved pipes are traced back to the beginning of the 1930s. It was shown already in the works by Tay-lor [15] and White [16] that the .ow in a curved pipe can remain laminar for substantial higher values of the Reynolds number compared to a straight pipe. The stabilization effect of curvature on the .ow was nicely visualized by Sreenivasan and Strykowski [55], who were the .rst ones to try to explain why the .ow in the coil is more stable compared to the downstream straight pipe sec-tion. The questions put forward in 1983 by the authors (¡°[¡­] what is the maximum Reynolds number for which laminarization is possible? [¡­] how precisely does the laminarized .ow return to a turbulent state when downstream of the coil the .ow is allowed to develop in another long straight pipe section?¡±) describe the puzzlement that prevailed in the community at that time about the transition from laminar to turbulent .ow in the presence of curva-ture. Speculations about the role of the secondary .ow or existing traveling waves [59,61] on the onset of instability were put for-ward through the years in the absence of a detailed instability analysis study. Pressure drop measurements, which were com-monly performed in order to relate the onset of turbulence to a deviation of the f¨CRe curve from the linear behavior of laminar .ow [52,65,76] gave little insight into the mechanisms of the tran-sition process as well. 
Instability analysis of the .ow in a torus (coil with zero pitch) became available only recently with the DNS study by Canton et al. [19] con.rming previous suggestions [62,65] that the transi-tion process in a curved pipe has several stages and is not as abrupt as in the straight pipe. It is con.rmed that for curvature ratios below 0.02¨C0.04, subcritical transition occurs and that the .rst instability in a torus is a Hopf bifurcation. Canton et al. could .nally give an explanation for the nonmonotonic behavior of the lower-critical Reynolds number that puzzled Sreenivasan and Strykowski 
[55] in the early 1980s, as a switch from subcritical to supercritical transition. It would be interesting, however, to extend such studies for the case of a coil and a wide range of coil pitches as well as investigate the effect of torsion on transition. 
Experiments designed to explore the velocity distribution and turbulence statistics in curved pipe .ows are maybe fewer than one would expect and were mainly performed with pressure probes, hot-wires, and LDV in mainly 90 deg and 180 deg bends. The results in these studies are seldom directly comparable since they are done at different parameter values (Re and c) but there are some common conclusions that can be drawn. All the studies show that the .ow is affected up to one diameter upstream the bend and also that the relaxation distance to fully developed pipe .ow downstream the bend is much longer. Furthermore, at the inlet of the bend the .ow accelerates on the inner (convex) side of the bend and decelerates on the outer side up to about 30 deg from the entrance, where after there is a shift of the high velocity region to the outer (concave) side of the bend. All the studies also show the existence of a pair of Dean cells. Various authors have tried to predict turbulent .ow in curved pipes by using RANS models (either eddy-viscosity or RSMs), however, those failed to capture the .ow correctly. 
The behavior of the Dean vortices under turbulent .ow condi-tions has met a revived interest during the last two decades, since the studies were initiated in 1968 by Tunstall and Harvey [129]. What is known today as the swirl-switching phenomenon or mechanism describes the temporal movement of the Dean vortices for turbulent .ow in a curved pipe; each of the Dean vortices takes over the .ow .eld changing direction of rotation from clockwise to anticlockwise alternatively. As remarked in 2005 by R€
utten et al. [113]: ¡°[¡­] this phenomenon could cause fatigue in piping systems due to low-frequency oscillations, [but] not much atten-tion seems to have been focused on it in the literature. It is for example, completely ignored in the review articles on curved pipes.¡± During the last 15 years, the swirl switching has attracted investigations both from numericists and experimentalists within the .uid dynamics¡¯ community. The most popular tools used so far are either LES (but also recently the .rst DNS to study this phenomenon were performed [121,182]) and PIV, which can pro-vide the three velocity components as well as a quantitative pic-ture of the secondary motion. At the same time, proper orthogonal decomposition started to become a popular tool in the hands of .uid dynamicists dealing with the swirl switching [110,124,126,132]. The main contributions in the literature the past two decades to unravel the mystery of this phenomenon are the following in chronological order: R€
utten et al. [113] found by means of LES that the oscillatory motion of the Dean cells is not caused by separation at the inner bend corner as initially believed by Tunstall and Harvey [129]. They also remarked that the switch-ing motion is not abrupt from one state to another (i.e., a dominant cell rotates clockwise and at another moment rotates in the oppo-site direction) but it is a smooth transition between different states. Kalpakli et al. [110] reconstructed (by means of POD analysis) the three states between which the two Dean vortices are switch-ing; symmetric, as well as dominant clockwise and counterclock-wise Dean cell. Sakakibara and Machida [128] made, through conditional averaging, the important observation that elongated structures existing upstream from the bend are correlated to the movement of the Dean cells downstream the bend. Those .ndings were later supported also by Hellstr€
om et al. [126] by means of POD analysis, and they additionally suggested that the .ow .eld in a curved pipe is governed by two states, the swirl switching (a sin-gle cell spanning the whole cross-section and appearing as mode 1) and the Dean motion (tilted Dean vortices with one of them being suppressed, those were seen as modes 2 and 3). The same modes were seen later also in the POD analysis by Kalpakli et al. [125], however, the physical meaning of them is still unclear. 
All the studies (from the initial one by Tunstall and Harvey to the more recent ones) agree on one thing that the swirl switching is happening at low frequencies that correspond to Strouhal num-bers of the order 10 2, however, peaks at higher St are also pres-ent in the spectra but are usually associated to other phenomena such as vortex shedding [110,113,121,130]. Despite the agreement on the frequency range, it is still unclear how this phenomenon is triggered; the most recent study and the .rst DNS data on the switching [121] showed that the cause of the oscillatory motion of the Dean cells can be neither separation nor upstream structures. The DNS were performed for a torus with periodic boundary con-ditions; therefore, there was no upstream straight section con-nected to the curved part where separation could occur, therefore the assumptions by previous investigators become obsolete. Fur-thermore, the POD modes from the DNS data did not depict the single swirl mode found in Ref. [126], but rather the POD modes from this study were very similar to the ones shown in Refs. [110] and [124]. Once more, it is still a blur what those modes can tell us or how important separation or upstream large-scale structures are for the triggering of the swirl switching, however, as indicated in Kalpakli et al. [125], those factors could still enhance or delay the oscillatory motion of the vortices. It appears from the above that in order to fully explore the mechanism and determine a phys-ical understanding of the swirl switching one should probably obtain the full three-dimensional .ow .eld upstream, along, and downstream a spatially developing bend, e.g., 90 deg, where both separation and upstream structures can be triggered and con-trolled. This is probably dif.cult to obtain experimentally, but a DNS of a 90 deg bend with upstream and downstream straight pipe sections could give some answers. Such a DNS is feasible and has been started recently [183,184]. The latter reference includes pre-liminary three-dimensional POD analysis of swirl switching. 

On the other hand, how the Dean vortices behave when an addi-tional motion (swirl and pulsation) is superimposed on turbulence is an unexplored area with a limited number of studies being available [17, 94,110,141,180]. In Ref. [180], PIV experiments of highly pulsating turbulent .ow in sharp bends revealed a vortex pattern varying from a single vortex at the end of deceleration to a ¡°steady-.ow-like¡± pattern at the peak of acceleration. Pulsating turbulent pipe .ow is generally neglected but when it comes to curved pipes, the available information is even more scarce. There is clearly an interest to study this complex .ow .eld for wider ranges of Reynolds and Womersley numbers as well as curvature ratios both in terms of statistics and secondary .ow behavior. 
From all the above, it is made clear that turbulent .ow in curved pipes is far from being fully understood, despite the great efforts done in the last decades. It is hence of both engineering and fundamental points of interest that further investigations are initiated.
